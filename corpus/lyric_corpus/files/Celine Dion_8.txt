lying in my bed.
thoughts in my head.
visions of you.
but i can not get through the night.

so pick up the phone.
i know you are home.
you are playing with my heart.
and you know that it just aingt right.

its just a game of love, love, love.
and even though its hard baby.
i can never give you up.

you are the one i am dreaming of.
i can not live without your love tonight.
and its you that i adore.
you are the one that i live for inside.
of you, i am dreaming of you.

so i get in the car.
but i did not get far.
cause the radio played.
every song that i sang with you.

yesterdays gone.
and it may be true.
but you know that.
i will never get over you.

its just a game of love, love love.
and even though it hurts me baby.
i can never give you up.

cause you are the one i am dreaming of.
i can not live without your love tonight.
and its you that i adore.
you are the one that i live for inside.
of you, i am dreaming of you.

you, you gave me love.
love gave us hope and strength.
to carry on and.
you, you gave me faith.
when i was falling down.
you would pick me up, my love.

you are the one i am dreaming of.
i can not live without your love tonight.
and its you that i adore.
you are the one that i live for inside.
baby, baby, baby, baby.
you are the one i am dreaming of.
i can not live without your love tonight.
and its you that i adore.
you are the one that i live for inside.
baby i am dreaming of you.
