trying to be misunderstood.
but it does not do me any good.
love the way they smile at me.
held that face for eternity.
now let them all fly off.

when it comes down.
it all comes down.
you will not be found.

when its over.
its all over.
even if i make a sound.

i will be misunderstood.
by the beautiful and good in...this city.
none of it was planned.
take me by the hand.
just dont try and understand.

try to be misunderstood.
just a product of my childhood.
and still i find myself outside.
you cant say i havent tried.
perhaps i tried too hard.

no exscuses.
i wont apoligise.
or justify your lies.
come find me.
tell them to me.
look me in the eyes.

i will be misunderstood.
by the beautiful and good in...this city.
none of this was planned.
take me by the hand.
just dont try and understand.

cant forgive sorry to say.
you dont know your guilty anyway.
isnt it funny how we dont speak.
the language of love.
