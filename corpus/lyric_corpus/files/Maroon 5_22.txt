i am full of regret.
for all the things that i have done and said.
and i do not know if it will ever be ok to show.
my face around here.
sometimes i wonder if i disappear.
would you ever turn your head and look.
see if i am gone.
cause i fear.

there is nothing left to say to you.
that you wanna hear.
that you wanna know.
i think i should go.
the things i have done are way too shameful.

you are just an innocent.
a helpless victim of a spiders web.
and i am an insect.
going after anything that i can get.
so you better turn your head and run.
and do not look back.
cause i fear.

there is nothing left to say to you.
that you wanna hear.
that you wanna know.
i think i should go.
the things i have done are way too shameful.
and i have done you so wrong.
treated you bad.
strung you along.
oh, shame on myself.
i do not know how i got so tangled up.

you better turn your head and look.
see if i am gone.
cause i fear.

there is nothing left to say to you.

and i have done you so wrong.
treated you bad.
