you say its all in my head.
and the things i think just do not make sense.
so where you been then? do not go all coy.
do not turn it round on me like its my fault.

see i can see that look in your eyes.
the one that shoots me each and every time.

you grace me with your cold shoulder.
whenever you look at me i wish i was her.
you shower me with words made of knives.
whenever you look at me i wish i was her.

these days, when i see you.
you make it look like i am see through.
do tell me why you waste our time.
when your heart aingt admitting you are not satisfied.

you know i know just how you feel.
i am starting to find myself feeling that way too.

when you grace me with your cold shoulder.
whenever you look at me i wish i was her.
you shower me with words made of knives.
whenever you look at me i wish i was her.

time and time again i will play the role of fools just for you.
even in the daylight when you are dreaming i am close to you.
try to look for things i hear but our eyes never find.
even though i do know how you play.

you grace me with your cold shoulder.
whenever you look at me i wish i was her.
you shower me with words made of knives.
whenever you look at me i wish i was her.

you grace me with your cold shoulder.
whenever you look at me i wish i was her.
you shower me with words made of knives.
whenever you look at me i wish i was her.
