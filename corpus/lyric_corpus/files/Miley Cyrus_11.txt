i have got my sight set on you.
and i am ready to aim.
i have a heart that will.
never be tamed.
i knew you were something special.
when you spoke my name.
now i can not wait, to see you again...

i have got a way of knowing.
when something is right.
i feel like i must have known you.
in another life.
cause i felt this deep connection.
when you looked in my eyes.
now i can not wait to see you again.

the last time i freaked out.
i just kept looking down.
i st st stuttered when.
you asked me what i am thinking bout.
felt like i could not breathe.
you asked whats wrong with me.
my best friend lesley said.
oh shes just being miley!

the next time we hang out.
i will redeem myself.
my heart can not rest till then.
whoa! whoa! i.
i can not wait to see you again.

i got this crazy feeling.
deep inside.
when you called and asked to see me.
tomorrow night.
i am not a mind reader.
but i am reading the signs.
that you can not wait to see me again.

the last time i freaked out.
i just kept looking down.
