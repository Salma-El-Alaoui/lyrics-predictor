push it out, fake a smile.
avert disaster, just in time.
i need a drink, cause in a while.
worthless answers from friends of mine.
its dumb to ask, cool to ignore.
girls posess me, but they are never mine.
i made my entrance, avoided hazards.
checked my engine, i fell behind........i fell behind.

she makes me feel like its raining outside.
and when the storms gone i am all torn up inside.
i am always nervous on, days like this like the prom.
i get too scared to move, cause i am a fucking boy.

remember when i was in the grocery store, nows my time.
lost the words,lost my nerve, lost the girl, left the line.
i would wish upon a star, but that star, it does not shine.
so read my book with a boring ending.
a short story of a lonely guy........who fell behind.

she makes me feel like its raining outside.
and when the storms gone i am all torn up inside.
i am always nervous on, days like this like the prom.
i get too scared to move, cause i am a fucking boy.

she makes me feel like its raining outside.
and when the storms gone i am all torn up inside.
i am always nervous on, days like this like the prom.
i get too scared to move, cause i am still just a stupid worthless boy.
