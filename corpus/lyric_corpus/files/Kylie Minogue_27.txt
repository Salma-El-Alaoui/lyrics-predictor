tell me i am only dreaming and i will believe you.
ca not see how this could be true.
surrounded by feelings i hardly recognise.
i look for explanations i am taken by surprise.
if you told me yesterday that i could feel this way.
i would sure enough call you a liar to your face.

chorus.
because i am shocked by the power.
shocked ooh.
shocked by the power of love.
i was rocked to my very foundations.
shocked by the power, shocked by the power.

maybe this time tomorrow.
i will discover this aingt really real.
cos it struck me like lightning.
like a bolt out of the blue.
emotions inside me, all over you.
i am high above the universe, losing track of time.
and falling free.
i can not believe that you are really mine.

chorus.

shocked, like the lightning from up above.
down from the heavens and it gave me love.
from a man who respects me.
loves my mind as well as my body.
no retreat and no surrender.
equal to you regardless of gender.
giving me love that is warm and tender.
thats why i gotta tell ya.

you and i are of the same mind.
it seems to me that we are one of a kind.
its true to say that when love is blind.
but then true love is so hard to find.
you respect me and the things i do.
it was meant to be.
i was made for you.
open the door to my heart, its stopped.
and i am shocked....

chorus.

surrounded by feelings i hardly recognise.
i look for explanations i am taken by surprise.
cos it struck me like lightning.
like a bolt out of the blue.
emotions inside me, all over you.

chorus.
repeat  fade.
