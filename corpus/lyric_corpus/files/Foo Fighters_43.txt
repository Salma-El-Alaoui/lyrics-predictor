tonight i am tangled in my blanket of clouds.
dreaming aloud.
things just will not do without you, matter of fact.
i am on your back, i am on your back, i am on your back.

if you walk out on me, i am walking after you.
if you walk out on me, i am walking after you.

if youd accept surrender, give up some more.
were not you adored.
i cannot be without you, matter of fact.
ooh i am on your back i am on your back.
ooh i am on your back.

if you walk out on me, i am walking after you.
if you walk out on me, i am walking after you.

another heart is cracked in two, i am on your back ooh.

i cannot be without you, matter of fact.
ooh i am on your back.

if you walk out on me, i am walking after you.
if you walk out on me, i am walking after you.
if you walk out on me, i am walking after you.

another heart is cracked in two, i am on your back ooh.
