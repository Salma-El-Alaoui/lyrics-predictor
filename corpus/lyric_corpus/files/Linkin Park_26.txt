i cannot take this anymore.
saying everything i have said before.
all these words they make no sense.
i found bliss in ignorance.
less i hear the less you will say.
you will find that out anyway.
just like before.

everything you say to me.
takes me one step closer to the edge and i am about to break.
i need a little room to breathe.
because i am one step closer to the edge, i am about to break.

i find the answers are not so clear.
wish i could find a way to disappear.
all these thoughts, they make no sense.
i found bliss in ignorance.
nothing seems to go away.
over and over again.
just like before.

everything you say to me.
takes me one step closer to the edge and i am about to break.
i need a little room to breathe.
because i am one step closer to the edge, i am about to break.

everything you say to me.
takes me one step closer to the edge and i am about to break.
i need a little room to breathe.
because i am one step closer to the edge, i am about to break.

shut up when i am talking to you.
shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up when i am talking to you.
shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up.
i am about to break.

everything you say to me.
takes me one step closer to the edge and i am about to break.
i need a little room to breathe.
because i am one step closer to the edge, i am about to break.

everything you say to me.
takes me one step closer to the edge and i am about to break.
i need a little room to breathe.
because i am one step closer to the edge, i am about to break.
