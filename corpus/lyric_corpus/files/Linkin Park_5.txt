memories consume like opening the wounds.
i am picking me apart again.
you all assume i am safe here in my room.
unless i try to start again.

i do not want to be the one the battles always choose.
because inside i realize that i am the one confused.

i do not know whats worth fighting for or why i have to scream.
i do not know why i instigate and say what i do not mean.
i do not know how i got this way, i know, its not alright.
so i am breaking the habit, i am breaking the habit tonight.

clutching my cure, i tightly lock the door.
i try to catch my breath again.
i hurt much more than any time before.
i had no options left again.

i do not want to be the one the battles always choose.
because inside i realize that i am the one confused.

i do not know whats worth fighting for or why i have to scream.
i do not know why i instigate and say what i do not mean.
i do not know how i got this way i will never be alright.
so i am breaking the habit, i am breaking the habit tonight.

i will paint it on the walls.
because i am the one at fault.
i will never fight again.
and this is how it ends.

i do not know whats worth fighting for or why i have to scream.
but now i have some clarity to show you what i mean.
i do not know how i got this way i will never be alright.
so i am breaking the habit, i am breaking the habit.
i am breaking the habit tonight.
