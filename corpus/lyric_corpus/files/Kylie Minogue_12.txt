especially for you.
i wanna let you know what i was going through.
all the time we were apart.
i thought of you.
you were in my heart.
my love never changed.
i still feel the same.

especially for you.
i wanna tell you i was feeling that way too.
and if dreams were wings, you know.
i would have flown to you.
to be where you are.
no matter how far.
and now that i am next to you.

no more dreaming about tomorrow.
forget the loneliness and the sorrow.
i have got to say.
its all because of you.

chorus.
and now we are back together, together.
i wanna show you my heart is oh so true.
and all the love i have is.
especially for you.

especially for you.
i wanna tell you, you mean all the world to me.
how i am certain that our love was meant to be.
you changed my life.
you showed me the way.
and now that i am next to you.

i have waited long enough to find you.
i wanna put all the hurt behind you.
and i wanna bring out all the love inside you.

chorus.

you were in my heart.
my love never changed.


chorus.
repeat  fade.
