try to sing this song.
i, i try to stand up.
but i can not find my feet.
i, i try to speak up.
but only in you i am complete.

gloria.
in te domine.
gloria.
exultate.
gloria.
gloria.
oh, lord, loosen my lips.

i try to sing this song.
i, i try to get in.
but i can not find the door.
the door is open.
you are standing there, you let me in.

gloria.
in te domine.
gloria.
exultate.
oh, lord, if i had anything, anything at all.
id give it to you.

gloria.
in te domine.
gloria.
gloria.
