i can hear so much in your sighs.
and i can see so much in your eyes.
there are words we both could say.
but do not talk, put your head on my shoulder.

come close, close your eyes and be still.
do not talk, take my hand and let me hear your heart beat.
being here with you feels so right.
we could live forever tonight.
lets not think about tomorrow.
and do not talk put your head on my shoulder.

come close, close your eyes and be still.
do not talk, take my hand and listen to my heart beat.
listen, listen, listen.

do not talk, put your head on my shoulder.
do not talk, close your eyes and be still.
do not talk, put your head on my shoulder.
do not talk, close your eyes and be still.
do not talk, put your head on my shoulder.
