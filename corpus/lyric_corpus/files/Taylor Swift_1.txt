i do not know what i want, so do not ask me.
cause i am still trying to figure it out.
do not know whats down this road, i am just walking.
trying to see through the rain coming down.
even though i am not the only one.
who feels the way i do.

chorus.
i am alone, on my own, and thats all i know.
oh i will be strong, i will be wrong, oh but life goes on.
i am just a girl, trying to find a place in this world.

got the radio on, my old blue jeans.
and i am wearing my heart on my sleeve.
feeling lucky today, got the sunshine.
could you tell me what more do i need.
and tomorrows just a mystery, oh yeah.
but thats ok.

repeat chorus.
maybe i am just a girl on a mission.
but i am ready to fly..

i am alone, on my own, and thats all i know.
oh i will be strong, i will be wrong, oh but life goes on.
oh i am alone, on my own, and thats all i know.
oh i am just a girl, trying to find a place in this world.

oh i am just a girl.
oh i am just a girl.
oh i am just a girl.
