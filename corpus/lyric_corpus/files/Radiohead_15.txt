two jumps in a week.
i bet you think thats pretty clever.
do not you boy.
flying on your motorcycle.
watching all the ground beneath you drop.

youd kill yourself for recognition.
kill yourself to never ever stop.
you broke another mirror.
you are turning into something you are not.

do not leave me high.
do not leave me dry.
do not leave me high.
do not leave me dry.

drying up in conversation.
you will be the one who cannot talk.
all your insides fall to pieces.
you just sit there.
wishing you could still make love.
they are the ones who will hate you.
when you think you have got the world.
all sussed out.
they are the ones who will spit at you.
you will be the one screaming out.

do not leave me high.
do not leave me dry.
do not leave me high.
do not leave me dry.

its the best thing that you ever had.
the best thing that you ever, ever had.
its the best thing that you ever had.
the best thing you have had, has gone away.

do not leave me high.
do not leave me dry.
do not leave me high.
do not leave me dry.

do not leave me high.
do not leave me high.
do not leave me dry.
