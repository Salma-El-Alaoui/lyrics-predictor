no one knew.
where he came from.
he never knew himself.
call her ma.
call him pa.
but he was born to someone else.
no one fooled.
or messed him around.
cause they were all afraid.
aingt no lies.
ice in the eyes.
of leeroy kincaid.

chorus.
cold hearted man.
one time lover heart in his hand.
cold hearted man.
and you can not trust nothing you do not understand.
cold hearted man.
cold hearted man.

like a snake.
he had no friends.
he did not need no one.
hurt his pride.
deep inside.
he was another mothers son.
reputation.
broken glass.
everybody prayed.
for their lives on the street.
where they happened to meet.
leeroy kincaid.

chorus.

sometimes you can not see.
the other side.
its too well hidden.
for the naked eye.
one time lover.
with his heart in his hand.
two time loser.
a broken man.

cold hearted man.
