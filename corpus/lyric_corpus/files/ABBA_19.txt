i have been cheated by you since i do not know when.
so i made up my mind it must come to an end.
look at me now.
will i ever learn.
i do not know how.
but i suddenly lose control.
theres a fire within my soul.

just one look and i can hear a bell ring.
one more look and i forget everything.
oh oh.

mamma mia.
here i go again.
my my.
how can i resist ya.
mamma mia.
does it show again.
my my.
just how much i have missed ya.
yes i have been brokenhearted.
blue since the day we parted.
why why.
did i ever let you go.

mamma mia.
now i really know.
my my.
i could never let you go.

i have been angry and sad about things that you do.
i can not count all the times that i told you we are through.
and when you go.
when you slam the door.
i think you know.
that you will not be away too long.
you know that i am not that strong.

just one look and i can hear a bell ring.
one more look and i forget everything.
whoah oh.

mamma mia.
here i go again.
my my.
how can i resist ya.
mamma mia.
does it show again.
my my.
just how much i have missed ya.
yes i have been brokenhearted.
blue since the day we parted.
why why.
did i ever let you go.

mamma mia.
even if i said.
bye bye.
leave me now or never.
mamma mia.
its a game we play.
bye bye.
does not mean forever.

mamma mia.
here i go again.
my my.
how can i resist ya.
mamma mia.
does it show again.
my my.
just how much i have missed ya.
yes i have been brokenhearted.
blue since the day we parted.
why why.
did i ever let you go.

mamma mia.
now i really know.
my my.
i could never let you go.
