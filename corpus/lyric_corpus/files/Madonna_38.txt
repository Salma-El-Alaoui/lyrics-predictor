take a bow, the night is over.
this masquerade is getting older.
lights are low, the curtains down.
theres no one here.
theres no one here, theres no one in the crowd.
say your lines but do you feel them.
do you mean what you say when theres no one around no one around.
watching you, watching me, one lonely star.
one lonely star you do not know who you are.

chorus.

i have always been in love with you always with you.
i guess you have always known its true you know its true.
you took my love for granted, why oh why.
the show is over, say good bye.

say good bye bye bye, say good bye.

make them laugh, it comes so easy.
when you get to the part.
where you are breaking my heart breaking my heart.
hide behind your smile, all the world loves a clown.
just make em smile the whole world loves a clown.
wish you well, i cannot stay.
you deserve an award for the role that you played role that you played.
no more masquerade, you are one lonely star.
one lonely star and you do not know who you are.

chorus, repeat.

say good bye bye bye, say good bye.

all the world is a stage world is a stage.
and everyone has their part has their part.
but how was i to know which way the storyd go.
how was i to know youd break.
youd break, youd break, youd break.
youd break my heart.

i have always been in love with you.
i have always been in love with you.
guess you have always known.
you took my love for granted, why oh why.
the show is over, say good bye.

say good bye bye bye, say good bye.
say good bye.
