i live in an apartment on the 99th floor of my block.
and i sit at home looking out the window imagining the world has stopped.
then in flies a guy whos all dressed up just like a union jack.
and says, i have won five pounds if i have his kind of detergent pack.

i said hey hey, you you, get off of my cloud.
hey hey, you you, get off of my cloud.
hey hey, you you, get off of my cloud.
do not hang around cause twos a crowd on my cloud, baby.

the telephone is ringing i say, hi, its me, who is it there on the line?
a voice says, hi, hello, how are you? well, i guess i am doing fine.
he says, its 3 am, theres too much noise, do not you people ever wanna go to.
bed?
just cause you feel so good, do you have to drive me out of my head?

i said hey hey, you you, get off of my cloud.
hey hey, you you, get off of my cloud.
hey hey, you you, get off of my cloud.
do not hang around cause twos a crowd on my cloud, baby.

i was sick and tired, fed up with this and decided to take a drive downtown.
it was so very quiet and peaceful, there was nobody, not a soul around.
i laid myself out, i was so tired, and i started to dream.
in the morning the parking tickets were just like rags stuck on my window screen.

i said hey hey, you you, get off of my cloud.
hey hey, you you, get off of my cloud.
hey hey, you you, get off of my cloud.
do not hang around cause twos a crowd on my cloud, baby.

hey hey, you you, get off of my cloud.
hey hey, you you, get off of my cloud.
hey hey, you you, get off of my cloud.
do not hang around, baby twos a crowd on my cloud, baby.
