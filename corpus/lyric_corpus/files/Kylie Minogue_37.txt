i i i i would not change.
i i i i would not change.
i i i i would not change.
i i i i would not change.
i i i i would not change.

some people do not understand.
what i see in you.
if only they knew.
they think my heads in the sand.
they will never see.
the best side of you.
is my heart ruling my mind.
maybe i am not right every time.
but i know i am right about this love of mine.

chorus.
if i had to do it all again.
i would not change a single thing.
theres no questioning in my heart.
when it comes to our love.
i would not change a thing.

yeah, i have had my doubts.
my ups and downs.
on the merry go round.
they say my heads in the cloud.
but i am keeping one.
foot on the ground.
i know they say love is blind.
but hes the best thing that happened to me.
and i am not ashamed for the world to see.

chorus.

i i i i would not change.
i i i i would not change.
i i i i would not change.
i i i i would not change.

is my heart ruling my mind.
maybe i am not right on every thing.
but i know i am right about this love of mine.

chorus.
repeat  fade.
