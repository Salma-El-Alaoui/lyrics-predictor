super trouper beams are gonna blind me.
but i will not feel blue.
like i always do.
cause somewhere in the crowd theres you.

i was sick and tired of everything.
when i called you last night from glasgow.
all i do is eat and sleep and sing.
wishing every show was the last show.

so imagine i was glad to hear youre coming.
suddenly i feel all right.
and suddenly its gonna be.
and its gonna be so different.
when i am on the stage tonight.

tonight the super trouper lights are gonna find me.
shining like the sun.
smiling, having fun.
feeling like a number one.

tonight the super trouper beams are gonna blind me.
but i wont feel blue.
like i always do.
cause somewhere in the crowd theres you.

facing twenty thousand of your friends.
how can anyone be so lonely.
part of a success that never ends.
still i am thinking about you only.

there are moments when i think i am going crazy.
but its gonna be alright.
you will soon be changing everything.
everything will be so different.
when i am on the stage tonight.

tonight the super trouper lights are gonna find me.
shining like the sun.
smiling, having fun.
feeling like a number one.

tonight the super trouper beams are gonna blind me.
but i will not feel blue.
like i always do.
cause somewhere in the crowd theres you.

so i will be there when you arrive.
the sight of you will prove to me im still alive.
and when you take me in your arms.
and hold me tight.
i know its gonna mean so much tonight.

tonight the super trouper lights are gonna find me.
shining like the sun.
smiling, having fun.
feeling like a number one.

tonight the super trouper beams are gonna blind me.
but i will not feel blue.
like i always do.
cause somewhere in the crowd theres you.
