i declare i do not care no more.
i am burning up and growing bored.
in my smoked out boring room.
my hair is shagging in my eyes.
dragging my feet to hit the street tonight.
to drive along these shit town lights.

i am not growing up, i am just burning out.
and i stepped in line to walk amongst the dead.

apathy has rained on me.
and now i am feeling like a soggy dream.
so close to drowning but i do not mind.
i have lived inside this mental cave.
throw my emotions in the grave.
hell, who needs them anyway.

i am not growing up, i am just burning out.
and i stepped in line to walk amongst the dead.
