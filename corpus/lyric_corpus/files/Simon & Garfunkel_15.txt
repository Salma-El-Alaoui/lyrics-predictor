cloudy.
the sky is grey and white and cloudy.
sometimes i think its hanging down on me.
and its a hitchhike a hundred miles.
im a ragamuffin child.
pointed finger, painted smile.
i left my shadow waiting down the road for me a while.
cloudy.
my thoughts are scattered and theyre cloudy.
they have no borders, no boundaries.
they echo and they swell.
from tolstoy to tinkerbell.
down from berkeley to carmel.
got some pictures in my pocket and a lot of time to kill.
hey sunshine.
i havent seen you in a long time.
why dont you show your face and bend my mind.
these clouds stick to the sky.
like a floating question why.
they linger there to die.
they dont know where theyre going.
and my friend, neither do i.
cloudy repeat 6 times.
