you can dance, you can jive.
having the time of your life.
see that girl, watch that scene.
digging the dancing queen.

friday night and the lights are low.
looking out for a place to go.
where they play the right music, getting in the swing.
you come to look for a king.
anybody could be that guy.
night is young and the musics high.
with a bit of rock music, everything is fine.
you are in the mood for a dance.
and when you get the chance.

you are the dancing queen.
young and sweet, only seventeen.
dancing queen.
feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah.
you can dance, you can jive.
having the time of your life.
see that girl, watch that scene.
digging the dancing queen.

you are a teaser, you turn em on.
leave em burning and then you are gone.
looking out for another, anyone will do.
you are in the mood for a dance.
and when you get the chance.

you are the dancing queen.
young and sweet, only seventeen.
dancing queen.
feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah.
you can dance, you can jive.
having the time of your life.
see that girl, watch that scene.
digging the dancing queen.
digging the dancing queen.
