smiling face and laughing eyes.
but ya can not keep on telling me all those lies.
howd you expect me to believe.
honey i aingt that naive.
baby i got my eye on you.
cause you do all the things i want you to.
stop your crying and dry your tears.
i aingt that wet behind the ears.

you can throw me lefts, you can throw me rights.
but where was you last night.
beating around the bush.

wish i knew what was on your mind.
why you being so unkind.
remember those nights we spent alone.
talking on the telephone.
thoughts of you going through my brain.
you told me that you felt the same.
you said that you loved me too.
but tell me who was there with you.

i was talking birds, and you was talking bees.
and was he down on his knees.
beating around the bush.

you are the meanest woman i have ever known.
sticks and stones will not break my bones.
i know what you are looking for.
you have eaten your cake you want some more.
i am gonna give you just a one more change.
try to save our romance.
i have done everything i am gonna do.
the rest is up to you.

and you can chew it up, you can spit it out.
you can let it all hang out.
beating around the bush.

and you can chew it up, you can spit it out.
you can let it all hang out.
beating around the bush.
