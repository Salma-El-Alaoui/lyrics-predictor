you keep on asking me.
why can not we be together.
i keep saying will not you wait a while.
whats all the hurry.
i thought we had forever.
i just need time til i can make up my mind.

i am not asking for.
a love to last forever.
i do not expect to get a guarantee.
its just that i believe.
lovers should stick together.
i am only saying.
will not you wait for me.

chorus.
i have got to be.
got to be certain.
i have got to be so sure.
i have had my share of hearts broken.
and i do not wanna take that any more.

i have got some friends who say.
boys are all the same.
they are only looking out for just one thing.
i am only hoping that.
you will not turn out like that.
i need some time til i can make up my mind.

been hurt in love before.
but i still come back for more.
i was such a fool.
i could not stop myself.
if you believe in me.
if you want our love to be.
i know you will wait for me, oh, oh, oh, oh.

chorus.

oh, oh, oh, oh.
oh, oh, oh, oh.

i am not asking for.
a love to last forever.
i do not expect to get a guarantee.
its just that i believe.
lovers should stick together.
i am only saying.
will not you wait for me.

chorus.
repeat  fade.
