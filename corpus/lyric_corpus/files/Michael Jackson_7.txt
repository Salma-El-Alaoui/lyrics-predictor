she was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene.
i said do not mind, but what do you mean i am the one.
who will dance on the floor in the round.
she said i am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round.

she told me her name was billie jean, as she caused a scene.
then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one.
who will dance on the floor in the round.

people always told me.
be careful of what you do.
and do not go around breaking young girls hearts.
and mother always told me.
be careful of who you love.
and be careful of what you do cause the lie becomes the truth.

now billie jean is not my lover.
shes just a girl who claims that i am the one.
but the kid is not my son.
she says i am the one.
but the kid is not my son.
no, no.

for forty days and for forty nights.
the law was on her side.
but who can stand when shes in demand.
her schemes and plans.
cause we danced on the floor in the round.
so take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice.
do think twice.

she told my baby wed danced till three, then she looked at me.
then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine oh, no!
cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby.

people always told me.
be careful of what you do.
and do not go around breaking young girls hearts.
do not break no hearts!
but she came and stood right by me.
then the smell of sweet perfume.
this happened much too soon.
she called me to her room.

but the kid is not my son.
