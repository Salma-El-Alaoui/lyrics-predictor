kindness in your eyes.
i guess you heard me cry.
you smiled at me like jesus to a child.
i am blessed i know.
heaven sent and heaven stole.
you smiled at me like jesus to a child.
and what have i learned from all this pain.
i thought i never feel the same about anyone or anything again.
but now i know.

chorus.
when you find a love.
when you know that it exists.
then the lover that you miss.
will come to you on those cold, cold nights.
when you have been loved.
when you know it holds such bliss.
then the lover that you kissed.
will comfort you when theres no hope in sight.

sadness in my eyes.
no one guessed and no one tried.
you smiled at me like jesus to a child.
loveless and cold.
with your last breath you saved my soul.
you smiled at me like jesus to a child.
and what have i learned from all these tears.
i have waited for you all those years.
then just when it began he took your love away.
but i still say.

chorus.

so the words you could not say.
i will sing them for you.
and the love we would have made.
i will make it for two.
for every single memory.
has become a part of me.
you will always be my love.
well i have been loved so i know just what love is.
and the lover that i kissed is always by my side.
oh the lover i still miss... was jesus to a child.
