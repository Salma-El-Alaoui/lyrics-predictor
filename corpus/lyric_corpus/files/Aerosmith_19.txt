i am down a one way street, with a one night stand.
with a one track mind, out in no mans land.
the punishment sometimes do not seem to fit the crime.

yeah, theres a hole in my soul, but one thing i have learned.
for every love letter written, theres another one burned.
so you tell me how its gonna be this time.

is it over?
is it over?
cause i am blowing out the flame.

take a walk outside your mind.
tell me how it feels to be.
the one who turns the knife inside of me.
take a look and you will find.
is nothing there girl, yeah i swear.
i am telling you girl yeah.

cause theres a hole in my soul.
thats been killing me forever.
its a place where a garden never grows.
theres a hole in my soul.
yeah, i should have known better.
cause your loves like a thorn without a rose.
yeah, yeah.

i am as dry as a seven year drought.
i got dust for tears and i am all tapped out.
sometimes i feel broke and can not get fixed.

i know theres been all kinds of shoes underneath your bed.
now i sleep with my boots on but you are still in my head.
something tells me this time i am down to my last licks.

cause if its over.
then its over.
and its driving me insane.

take a walk outside your mind.
tell me how it feels to be.
the one who turns the knife inside of me.
take a look and you will find.
is nothing there girl, yeah i swear.
i am telling you girl, yeah.

cause theres a hole in my soul.
thats been killing me forever.
its a place where a garden never grows.
theres a hole in my soul.
yeah, i should have known better.
cause your loves like a thorn without a rose.
yeah, yeah.

yeah, is it over?

and i am blowing out the flame.

take a walk outside your mind.

the one who turns the knife inside of me.
