its no secret that the stars are falling from the sky.
its no secret that our world is in darkness tonight.
they say the sun is sometimes.
eclipsed by a moon.
you know i do not see you.
when she walks in the room.

its no secret that a friend is someone who lets you help.
its no secret that a liar will not believe anyone else.
they say a secret is something.
you tell one other person.
so i am telling you.
child.

that, love, we shine like a burning star.
love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love.
we are falling from the sky tonight.
love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love.
a man will beg.
a man will crawl.
love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love.
on the sheer face of love.
like a fly from a wall.
love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love.
its no secret at all.

no secret that a conscience can sometimes be a pest.
no secret ambition bites the nails of success.
every artist is a cannibal.
every poet is a thief.
all kill their inspiration.
and sing about their grief.
oh love.

love, we shine like a burning star.
love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love.

we are falling from the sky tonight.
love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love.
a man will beg.
a man will crawl.
love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love.
on the sheer face of love.
like a fly from a wall.
love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love.
its no secret at all.

love, we shine like a burning star.
we are falling from the sky tonight.
a man will beg.
a man will crawl.
on the sheer face of love.
like a fly from a wall.
its no secret at all.

its no secret that the stars are falling from the sky.
the universe exploded cause of one mans lie.
check, i gotta go.
yeah, i am running outta change.
theres a lot of things.
if i could, id rearrange.
