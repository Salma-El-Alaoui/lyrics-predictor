when i was young.
i never needed anyone.
and making love was just for fun.
those days are gone.
living alone.
i think of all the friends i have known.
when i dial the telephone.
nobodys home.

all by myself.
do not wanna be.
all by myself.
anymore.

hard to be sure...
sometimes i feel so insecure.
and loves so distant and obscure.
remains the cure.

all by myself.
do not wanna be.
all by myself.
anymore.
all by myself.
do not wanna live.
all by myself.
anymore.

all by myself.
do not wanna live.
oh.
do not wanna live.
by myself, by myself.
anymore.
by myself.
anymore.
oh.
all by myself.
do not wanna live.
and never, never, never.
needed anyone.
