so you are on the floor, at 54.
think you can last  at the palace.
does your body go to the to and fro?
but tonights the night  or did not you know.
that ivan meets g.i. joe.

he tried his tricks  that ruskie bear.
the united nations said its all fair.
he did the radiation  the chemical plague.
but he could not win  with a cossack spin.

the vostok bomb  the stalin strike.
he tried every move  he tried to hitch hike.
he drilled a hole  like a russian star.
he made every move in his repertoire.

when ivan meet g.i. joe.

now it was g.i. joes turn to blow.
he turned it on  cool and slow.
he tried a payphone call to the pentagon.
a radar scan  a leviathan.

he wiped the earth  clean as a plate.
what does it take to make a ruskie break?
but the crowd are bored and off they go.
over the road to watch china blow!

when ivan meets g.i. joe.
