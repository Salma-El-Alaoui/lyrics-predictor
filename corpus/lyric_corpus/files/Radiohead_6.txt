in my mind and nailed into my heels.
all the time killing what i feel.

and everything i touch.
all wrapped up in cotton wool.
all wrapped up and sugar coated.
turns to stone.

and everything i touch.
all wrapped up in cotton wool.
all wrapped up and sugar coated.
turns stone.

i am fused just in case i blow out.
i am glued just because i crack out.

everything i touch turns to stone.
everything i touch.
all wrapped up in cotton wool.
all wrapped up and sugar coated.
