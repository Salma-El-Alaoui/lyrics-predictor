girl, you know i did it.
its over and i feel fine.
nothing you can say is gonna change my mind.
waited, and i waited the longest night.
nothing like the taste of sweet decline.

i went down and i fell, i fell so fast.
dropping like the grains in an hour glass.
never say forever cause nothing lasts.
dancing with the bones of my buried past.

never mind theres nothing i could do.
bet your life theres something killing you.

its a shame we have to die my dear.
no ones getting out of here alive.
this time.
what a way to go but have no fear.
no ones getting out of here alive.
this time.

i am finished, i am getting you off my chest.
made you come clean in a dirty dress.
a promise is a promise you kept in check.
hard to cross a heart that beats its fist.

take a good hard look for the very last time.
the very last one in a very long line.
only took a second to say goodbye.
been a pleasure, but the pleasures been mine all mine.

chorus.

aingt no way.
d.o.a.
aingt no way.
d.o.a.

take a good hard look for the very last time.
the very last one in a very long line.
only took a second to say goodbye.
been a pleasure, but the pleasures been mine all mine.

bridge.

chorus.

its a shame we have to disappear.
no ones getting out of here alive.
this time.
this time.
this time.
