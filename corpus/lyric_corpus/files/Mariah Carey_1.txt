how can i just let you walk away.
just let you leave without a trace.
when i stand here taking every breath with you.
you are the only one who really knew me at all.

how can you just walk away from me.
when all i can do is watch you leave.
cause we shared the laughter and the pain.
and even shared the tears.
you are the only one who really knew me at all.

so take a look at me now.
cause theres just an empty space.
theres nothing left here to remind me.
just the memory of your face.

so take a look at me now.
when theres just an empty space.
and you are coming back to me is against all odds.
and thats what i have got to face.

i wish i could just make you turn around.
turn around to see me cry.
theres so much i need to say to you.
so many reasons why.
