again again lyrics.

you have gotta a lotta lotta nerve.
coming here when i am still with him.
and i can not have you, it is not fair.
born march of 86, my birthdays coming.
and if i had one wish.
yeah, youd be it.

when you are round.
i lose myself inside your mouth.
you have got brown eyes.
like no one else.
baby make it to me.

again and again.
again, again, again, again.
never stop again and again.
again, again, a a again, again.
never stop, oh.

he never really saw me.
or waited when we were hooking up.
yeah hed a never last.
last week when i was sad.
you said that you knew.
my eyes change from kinda green.
to kind blue, heya.

when you are round.
i lose myself inside your mouth.
you have got brown eyes.
like no one else.
baby make it to me.

again and again.
again, again, again, again.
never stop again and again.
again, again, a a again, again.
never stop.

they tell me if i leave him.
baby would you be there.
cause maybe you could.
be m m mine all the t t time.
