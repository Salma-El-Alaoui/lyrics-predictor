easily let us get carried away.
easily let us get married today.
shao lin shouted a rose.
from his throat.
everything must go.
a licking stick is thicker.
when you break it to show.
everything must go.

the story of a woman on the morning of a war.
remind me if you will exactly what we are fighting for.

calling calling for something in the air.
calling calling i know you must be there.

easily let us get caught in a wave.
easily we will not get caught in a cave.
shao lings shaking for the sake.
of his soul everything must go.
looking mighty tired of.
all the thing that you own.
everything must go.

i can not tell you who to idolize.
you think its almost over.
but its only on the rise.
calling calling.
for something in the air.
calling calling.
i know you must be there.

the story of a woman on the morning of a war.
remind me if you will exactly what we are fighting for.

throw me to the wolves.
because theres order in the pack.
throw me to the sky.
because i know i am coming back.

shao lings shaking for the sake.
of his soul everything must go.
looking mighty tired of.
all the thing that you own.
everything must go.

the story of a woman on the morning of a war.

i do not want to be your little research monkey boy.
the creature that i am is only going to destroy.

throw me to the wolves.
because theres order in the pack.
throw me to the sky.
because i know i am coming back.

easily.
