a little loaded she was stealing another breath.
i love my baby to death.

california rest in peace.
simultaneous release.
california show your teeth.
shes my priestess i am your priest.

who knew the other side of you?
who knew what others died to prove?
too true to say goodbye to you.
too true to say say say.

push the fader, gifted animator.
one for the now and eleven for the later.
never made it up to minnesota.
north dakota man was a gunning for the quota.

down in the badlands, she was saving the best for last.
