in this world of hate and shallowness.
where enemies become your consolation.
and those of us who win the game give up our minds.
i do not call that winning.
say this does not apply to you.
but ask yourself first.
what have i done today to win the game.
and just what have i sacrificed.

win the battle lose the war.
i know i have played this game before.
when people were still real.
i do not want this anymore.
its time for me to close the door.
theres nothing left to feel.

reflect on all our yesterdays.
my own words choke me.
why were they spoken.
regret for the things i have said and done.
just can not compare with.
regret for those that i have never tried.
so blame this world or blame yourself.
its really all the same.
when you are standing on the precipice.
from which you just cannot return.

win the battle or lose the war.
i know i have played this game before.
when people were still real.
i do not want this anymore.
its time for me to close the door.
theres nothing left to feel.

in the style of forgotten men.
i look to my horizon.
i see nothing.
while thoughts of guns and desecration.
sweep through my mind.
but only coffins and bones remain.
as i look to you.
the emptiness behind your eyes.
seals my decision.
ca not carry on in this world of jugglers.
where all this thoughtlessness and bludgeonings.
your key to success.
what kind of tradition to carry on.

blackball the new disease.
blackball the new disease.
blackball your evil ways.
have found their way inside me.

blackball the new disease.
blackball the new disease.
blackball for a better life.
in this high tech dog eat dog existence.
