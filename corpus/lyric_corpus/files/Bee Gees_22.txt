verse 1.
in the event of something happening to me.
there is something i would like you all to see.
its just a photograph of someone that i knew.

chorus.
have you seen my wife, mr. jones?
do you know what its like on the outside?
do not go talking too loud, you will cause a landslide.
mr. jones.

verse 2.
i keep straining my ears to hear a sound.
maybe someone is digging underground.
or have they given up and all gone home to bed?
thinking those who once existed must be dead?

chorus.
have you seen my wife, mr. jones?
do you know what its like on the outside?
do not go talking too loud, you will cause a landslide.
mr. jones.
