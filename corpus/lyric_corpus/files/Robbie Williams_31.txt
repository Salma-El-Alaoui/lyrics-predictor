loose lips sunk ships.
i am getting to grips.
with what you have said.
no its not in my head.
i can not awaken the dead day after day.
why do not we talk about it?
why do you always doubt that there could be a better way?
it does not make me wanna stay.

chorus.
why do not we break up?
theres nothing left to say.
i have got my eyes shut, praying they will not stray.
and we are not sexed up.
thats what makes the difference today.
i hope you blow away.

you say we are fatally flawed.
well i am easily bored, is that okay?
strike me off your list.
make this the last kiss.
i will walk away.

why do not we talk about it?
i am only here.
do not shout it.
given time we will forget.
let us pretend we never met.

chorus.

screw you, i did not like your taste.
anyway, i chose you.
and thats all gone to waste.
its saturday, i will go out and find another you.

chorus.

why do not we.
why do not we break up.
theres nothing left to say.
i have got my eyes shut.
praying they will not stray.
and we are not sexed up.
thats what makes the difference today.
i hope you blow away.
i hope you blow away.
i hope you blow away.
i hope you blow away.
blow away.
blow away.
just blow away.
