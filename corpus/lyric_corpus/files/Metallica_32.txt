guilty as charged.
but damn it, it aingt right.
theres someone else controlling me.

death in the air.
strapped in the electric chair.
this can not be happening to me.

who made you god to say.
i will take your life from you.

flash before my eyes.
now its time to die.
burning in my brain.
i can feel the flame.

wait for the sign.
to flick the switch of death.
its the beginning of the end.

sweat chilling cold.
as i watch death unfold.
consiousness is my only friend.

my fingers grip with fear.
what am i doing here?

flash before my eyes.
now its time to die.
burning in my brain.
i can feel the flame.

someone help me.
oh please god help me.
they are trying to take it all away.
i do not want to die.

time moving slow.
the minutes seem like hours.
the final curtain all i see.

how true is this?
just get it over with.
if this is true, just let it be.

wakened by horrid scream.
freed from this frightening dream.

flash before my eyes.
now its time to die.
burning in my brain.
i can feel the flame.
