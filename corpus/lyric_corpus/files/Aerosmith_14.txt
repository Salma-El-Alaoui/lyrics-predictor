wake up kid, its half past your youth.
aingt nothing really changing but the date.
you a grand slammer, but you no babe ruth.
you gotta learn how to relate.
or you will be swinging from the pearly gate.
ah, got all the answers, lo and behold.
you got the right key baby but the wrong key hole, yo.

well i woke up this morning.
on the wrong side of the bed.
and how i got to thinking.
about all those things you said.
about ordinary people.
and how they make you sick.
and if calling names kicks back on you.
then i hope this does the trick.

cause i am sick of your complaining.
about how many bills.
and i am sick of all your bitching.
bout your poodles and your pills.
and i just can not see no humor.
about your way of life.
and i think i can do more for you.
with this here fork and knife.

eat the rich.
theres only one thing that they are good for.
eat the rich.
take one bite now, come back for more.
eat the rich.
i gotta get this off my chest.
eat the rich.
take one bite now, spit out the rest.

so i called up my head shrinker.
and told him what i done.
he said, you best go on a diet.
yeah i hope you have some fun.
and a do not go burst a bubble.
on rich folk who get rude.
cause you will not get in no trouble.
when you eats that kind of food.

now they are smoking up their junk bonds.
and then they go get stiff.
and they are dancing at the yacht club.
with muff and uncle biff.
but theres one good thing that happens.
when you toss your pearls to swine.
their attitudes may taste like shit.
but go real good with wine.

eat the rich.
theres only one thing that they are good for.
eat the rich.
take one bite now, come back for more.
eat the rich.
i gotta get this off my chest.
eat the rich.
take one bite now, spit out the rest.

believe in all the good things.
that money just can not buy.
then you will not get no bellyache.
from eating humble pie.
i believe in rags to riches.
your inheritance will not last.
so take your grey poupon my friend.
and shove it up your ass.

eat the rich.
theres only one thing that they are good for.
eat the rich.
take one bite now, come back for more.
eat the rich.
i gotta get this off my chest.
eat the rich.
take one bite now, spit out the rest.

eat the rich.
theres only one thing that they are good for.
eat the rich.
take one bite now, come back for more.
eat the rich.
do not stop me now i am going crazy.
eat the rich.
thats my idea of a good time baby.
