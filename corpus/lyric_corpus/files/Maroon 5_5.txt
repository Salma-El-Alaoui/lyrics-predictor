how dare you say that my behaviors unacceptable.
so condescending, unnecessarily critical.
i have the tendency of getting very physical.
so watch your step cause if i do you will need a miracle.

you drain me dry and make me wonder why i am even here.
this double vision i was seeing is finally clear.
you want to stay but you know very well i want you gone.
not fit to funking tread the ground that i am walking on.

when it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love.
you will understand what i mean when i say.
theres no way we are gonna give up.
and like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams.
is there anyone out there cause its getting harder and harder to breathe.
is there anyone out there cause its getting harder and harder to breathe.

what you are doing is screwing things up inside my head.
you should know better you never listened to a word i said.
clutching your pillow and writhing in a naked sweat.
hoping somebody someday will do you like i did.

when it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love.
you will understand what i mean when i say.
theres no way we are gonna give up.
and like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams.
is there anyone out there cause its getting harder and harder to breathe.
is there anyone out there cause its getting harder and harder to breathe.

does it kill.
does it burn.
is it painful to learn.
that its me that has all the control.

does it thrill.
does it sting.
when you feel what i bring.
and you wish that you had me to hold.

when it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love.
you will understand what i mean when i say.
theres no way we are gonna give up.
and like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams.
is there anyone out there cause its getting harder and harder to breathe.
