skin and bones, it aingt such a pity.
if you think i am vain, better shut ya lip.
i can not explain how to be fat city.
if you gotta live large, gotta let it rip.

skin and bones, it aingt such a pity.

if ya wanna hang loose gotta get a grip rip.

once upon a crime i thought i was cool but i do not want to brag.
once i crossed the line i think i musta zigged when i shoulda zagged.

chorus.

same old same old every day if things do not change you are just gonna rot.

chorus.

as long as you are in it.

skin and bones, it aingt such a pity.
do not cha gimme no flack, honey shut ya lip.
ya gotta have stones if you are living in the city.
if ya wanna hang loose gotta get a grip.
