destiny, destiny protect me from the world.
destiny, hold my hand, protect me from the world.
here we are with our running and confusion.
and i do not see no confusion anywhere.

and if the world does turn and if london burns.
i will be standing on the beach with my guitar.
i want to be in a band when i get to heaven.
anyone can play guitar and they will not be a nothing any more.

grow my hair, grow my hair, i am jim morrison.
grow my hair, i wanna be, wanna be, wanna be jim morrison.
here we are with our running and confusion.
and i do not see no confusion anywhere.

and if the world does turn and if london burns.
i will be standing on the beach with my guitar.
i want to be in a band when i get to heaven.
anyone can play guitar and they will not be a nothing any more..
