you have a way of coming easily to me.
and when you take, you take the very best of me.
so i start a fight cause i need to feel something.
and you do what you want cause i am not what you wanted.

chorus.
oh, what a shame.
what a rainy ending given to a perfect day.
just walk away, no use defending words that you will never say.
and now that i am sitting here thinking it through, i have never been anywhere cold as you.

you put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray.
and i stood there loving you and washed them all away.
and you come away with a great little story of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you.

chorus.
oh, what a shame.
what a rainy ending given to a perfect day.
so just walk away, no use defending words that you will never say.
and now that i am sitting here thinking it through, i have never been anywhere cold as you.

you never did give a damn thing, honey.
but i cried, cried for you.
and i know you would not have told nobody if i died, died for you.
died for you.

oh, what a shame.
what a rainy ending give to a perfect day. every smile you fake is so condescending.
counted all the scars you made.
now that i am sittin her thinking it through, i have never been anywhere cold as you.
