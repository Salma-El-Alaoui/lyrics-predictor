its a critical solution.
and the east coast got the blues.
its a mass of confusion.
like the lies they sell to you.

you got a glass jawed toothache.
of a mental disease.
an they be running round back.
see em line up on their knees.
cause the kiss ass sycophants.
throwing penance at your feet.

when they got nowhere to go.
watch em come in off the streets.
while they are banging out front.
inside their slamming to the cruch.
go on an throw me to the lions.
and the whole damn screaming bunch.
cause the pissed off rip offs.
r everywhere you turn.
tell me how a generations.
ever sposed to learn.
this fire is burning.
and its out of control.
its not a problem you can stop.
its rock n roll.

i read it on a wall.
it went straight to my head.
it said dance to the tension.
of a world on edge.
we got racial violence.
and who will cast the first stone.
and sex is used anyway it can be.
sometimes when i look out.
its hard to see the day.
its a feeling you can have it.
its not mine to take away.

lost in the garden of eden.
said we are lost in the garden of eden.
and theres no ones gonna believe this.
but we are lost in the garden of eden.
this fire is burning.
and its out of control.
its not a problem you can stop.
its rock n roll.
suck on that.

looking through this point of view.
theres no way i am gonna fit in.
do not ya tell me what my eyes see.
do not ya tell me who to believe in.
i aingt superstitious.
but i know when somethings wrong.
i have been dragging my heels.
with a bitch called hope.
let the undercurrent drag me along.

lost in the garden of eden.
said we are lost in the garden of eden.
and theres no ones gonna believe this.
but we are lost in the garden of eden.

most organized religions make.
a mockery of humanity.
our governments are dangerous.
and out of control.
the garden of eden is just another graveyard.
said if they had someone to buy it.
said i am sure theyd sell my soul.

this fire is burning.
and its out of control.
its not a problem you can stop.
its rock n roll.
lost in the garden of eden.
an we aingt talking about no poison apple or some missing rib ya hear.
said we are lost in the garden of eden.
and theres no ones gonna believe this.
said we are lost in the garden of eden.
this fire is burning.
and its out of control.
its not a problem you can stop.
its rock n roll.
