id rather be a sparrow than a snail.
yes, i would.
if i could.
i surely would.
id rather be a hammer than a nail.
yes, i would.
if i only could.
i surely would.

away, id rather sail away.
like a swan thats here and gone.
a man gets tied up to the ground.
he gives the world.
its saddest sound.
its saddest sound.

id rather be a forest than a street.
yes, i would.
if i could.
i surely would.

id rather feel the earth beneath my feet.
yes, i would.
if i only could.
i surely would.
