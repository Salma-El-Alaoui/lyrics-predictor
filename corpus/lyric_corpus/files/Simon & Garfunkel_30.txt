are you going to scarborough fair?
parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme.
remember me to one who lives there  .
she once was a true love of mine.

tell her to make me a cambric shirt.
on the side of a hill in the deep forest green.
parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme.
tracing a sparrow on snow crested ground.
without no seams nor needlework.
blankets and bedclothes, a child of the mountains.
then she will be a true love of mine.
sleeps unaware of the clarion call.

tell her to find me an acre of land.
on the side of a hill, a sprinkling of leaves.
parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme.
washed is the ground with so many tears.
between the salt water and the sea strand.
a soldier cleans and polishes a gun.
then she will be a true love of mine.

tell her to reap it in a sickle of leather.
war bellows blazing in scarlet battalions.
parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme.
generals order their soldiers to kill.
and gather it all in a bunch of heather.
and to fight for a cause they have long ago forgotten.
then she will be a true love of mine.
