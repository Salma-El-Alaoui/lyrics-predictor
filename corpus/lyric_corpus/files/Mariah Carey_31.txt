treated me kind.
sweet destiny.
carried me through desperation.
to the one that was waiting for me.
it took so long.
still i believed.
somehow the one that i needed.
would find me eventually.

i had a vision of love.
and it was all that you have given to me.

prayed through the nights.
felt so alone.
suffered from alienation.
carried the weight on my own.
had to be strong.
so i believed.
and now i know i have succeeded.
in finding the place i conceived.

i had a vision of love.
and it was all that you have given to me.
i had a vision of love.
and it was all that you have given me.

i have realized a dream.
and i visualized.
the love that came to be.
feel so alive.
i am so thankful that i have received.
the answer that heaven has sent down to me.

you treated me kind.
sweet destiny.
and i will be eternally grateful.
holding you so close to me.
prayed through the nights.
so faithfully.
knowing the one that i needed.
would find me eventually.

i had a vision of love.
and it was all that you have given to me.
i had a vision of love.
and it was all that you turned out to be.
