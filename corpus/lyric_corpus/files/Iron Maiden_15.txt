i am running out of my time, i am running out of breath.
and now its getting so i can not sleep at night.
in the day, feel like death.

i am getting in far too deep, i feel them closing in.
i have got to say that i am scared, i know they will win.
even so, i am prepared.

do you believe, what you hear.
can you believe, what you see.
do you believe, what you feel.
can you believe?

what is real?
futureal.
what is real?
futureal.

whenever anyone seems to treat me like a freak.
it makes me see i am the only one who feels.
that i know what is real.

and sometimes it feels like a game of deadly hide and seek.
and when you are reading this, then i will be gone.
maybe then, you will see.

do you believe, what you hear.
can you believe, what you see.
do you believe, what you feel.
can you believe?

what is real?
futureal.
what is real?
futureal.
