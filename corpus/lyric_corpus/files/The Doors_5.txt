five to one, baby.
one in five.
no one here gets out alive.
now, you get yours, baby.
i will get mine.
gonna make it baby if we try.

the old get old, baby.
and the young get stronger.
may take a week and it may take longer.
they got the guns but, we got the numbers.
gonna win yeah, we are taking over!
come on.

your ballroom days are over, baby.
night is drawing near.
shadows of the evenings.
crawl across the years.
you walk across the floor.
with a flower in your hand.
trying to tell me no one understands.
trade in your hours for a handful of dimes.
gonna make it baby in our prime.
come together one more time.
come together one more time.

get together one more time.
get together one more time.
get together one more time.
get together one more time.
get together one more time.
get together one more time.
get together one more time.
