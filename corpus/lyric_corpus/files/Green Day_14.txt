another turning point, a fork stuck in the road.
time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go.
so make the best of this test, and do not ask why.
its not a question, but a lesson learned in time.

its something unpredictable, but in the end its right.
i hope you had the time of your life.

so take the photographs, and still frames in your mind.
hang it on a shelf in good health and good time.
tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial.
for what its worth it was worth all the while.

its something unpredictable, but in the end its right.
i hope you had the time of your life.

its something unpredictable, but in the end its right.
i hope you had the time of your life.

its something unpredictable, but in the end its right.
i hope you had the time of your life.
