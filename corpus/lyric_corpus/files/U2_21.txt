is it getting better?
or do you feel the same?
will it make it easier on you, now.
you got someone to blame.
you say one love, one life.
when its one need, in the night.
one love, we get to share it.
it leaves you, baby, if you do not care for it.

did i disappoint you?
or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
you act like you never had love.
and you want me to go without.
well, its too late, tonight.
to drag the past out into the light.
we are one, but we are not the same.
we get to carry each other, carry each other.
one...

have you come here for forgiveness.
have you come to raise the dead.
have you come here to play jesus.
to the lepers in your head.
did i ask too much, more than a lot.
you gave me nothing, now its all i got.
we are one, but we are not the same.
well, we hurt each other.
then we do it again.

you say love is a temple, love a higher law.
love is a temple, love the higher law.
you ask me to enter, but then you make me crawl.
and i can not be holding on, to what you got.
when all you got is hurt.

one love, one blood.
one life, you got to do what you should.
one life with each other sisters, brothers.
one life, but we are not the same.
we get to carry each other, carry each other.
one lone.
one...

make in it, make in it, higher....
