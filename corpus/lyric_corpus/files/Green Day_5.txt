stranded, lost inside myself.
my own worst friend and my own closest enemy.
branded, maladjusted.
never trusted anyone let alone myself.

i must insist.
on being a pessimist.
i am a loner in a catastrophic mind.

elected the rejected.
i perfected the science of the idiot.
no meaning and no healing.
self loathing freak and introverted deviant.
