what in the world happened to you?

before you started toking.
you used to have a brain.
but now you do not get even the simplest of the things.
i can draw a little picture.
or even use my hands.
i try to explain but you just do not understand.

chorus.
man you are really losing it.
and you have really done a lot of junk now.
but you keep abusing it.
what in the world happened to you.

its bad enough you do it to yourself.
but taking someone with you well you know thats something else.
i say i am not that kind of person.
i am not that kind of man.
i try to explain but you just do not understand.

chorus.
man you are really losing it.
and you have really done a lot of junk now.
but you keep abusing it.
what in the world happened to you.
2x.

i might be sympathetic or cut a little slack.
if i thought that you were willing to give a little back.
but you do it in the morning.
you do it in the night.
you lie to refrain from just facing your life.
so i will see you man tomorrow.
you will be gacking up again.
i will see you in a coffin by the time your wad is spent.
i think of all the times that i tried to lend a hand.
i try to explain but you just do not understand.

chorus.
man you are really losing it.
and you have really done a lot of junk now.
but you keep abusing it.
what in the world happened to..
what in the world happened to..
what in the world happened to you.
