now every cheap hood strikes a bargain with the world.
and ends up making payments on a sofa or a girl.
love n hate tattooed across the knuckles of his hands.
the hands that slap his kids around cause they do not understand how.

chorus.
death or glory becomes just another story.
death or glory becomes just another story.

and every gimmick hungry job digging gold from rock n roll.
grabs the mike to tell us he will die before hes sold.
but i believe in this and its been tested by research.
that he who fucks nuns will later join the church.

chorus.

in every dingy basement on every dingy street.
every dragging hand clap over every dragging beat.
thats just the beat of time the beat that must go on.
if you been trying for years then we already heard your song.

chorus.

gonna march a long way.
gonna fight a long time.
got to travel over mountains.
got to travel over seas.

we are gonna fight you, brother.
we are gonna fight till you lose.
we are gonna raise trouble.
we are gonna raise hell.

we are gonna fight you, brother.
we are gonna raise hell.

chorus.
