when love breaks up.
when the dawn light wakes up.
a new life is born   oooooh.

i wake up.
feel just fine.
your face.
fills my mind.
i get religion quick.
cos you are looking divine.
honey you are touching something, you are touching me.
i am under your thumb, under your spell, can not you see ?
if i could only reach you.
if i could make you smile.
if i could only reach you.
that would really be a breakthru   oh yeah.

speaks books to me.

with each and every one of your looks at me.
