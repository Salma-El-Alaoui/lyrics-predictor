on the way.
trying to get where id like to stay.
i am always feeling steered away.
by someone trying to tell me.
what to say and do.
i do not want it.
i gotta go find my own way.
i gotta go make my own mistakes.
sorry man for feeling.
feeling the way i do.

chorus.
oh yeah, oh yeah.
open wide and they will shove in.
their meaning of life.
oh yeah, oh yeah.
but not for me. i will do it on my own.
oh yeah, oh yeah.
open wide and swallow their meaning of life.
i can not make it work your way.
thanks but no thanks.

by the way.
i know your path has been tried and so.
it may seem like the way to go.
me, id rather be found.
trying something new.
and the bottom line.
in all of this seems to say.
theres no right and wrong way.
sorry if i do not feel like.
living the way you do.

chorus x2.
