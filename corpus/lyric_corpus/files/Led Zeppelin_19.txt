as i walk down the highway, all i do is sing this song.
and a train thats passing my way, helps the rhythm move along.
there is no doubt about the words are clear.
the voice is strong, is oh so strong.

i am just a simple guy, i live from day to day.
a ray of sunshine melts my frown, and blows my blues away.
theres nothing more that i can say, but on a day like today.
i pass the time away, and walk a quiet mile with you.

all i need from you, is all your love.
all you got to give to me, is all your love.
all i need from you, is all your love.
all you got to give to me, is all your love.
ooh yeah, ooh yeah.
ooh yeah, ooh yeah.

i am so glad i am living, and gonna tell the world i am.
i got me a fine woman, and she says that i am her man.
one thing that i know for sure, gonna give her all the loving.
like nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody can.

standing in the noonday sun, trying to flag a ride.
people go and people come, see my rider right by my side.
its a total disgrace, they set the pace, it must be a race.
and the best thing i can do is run.

all i need from you, is all your love.
all you got to give to me, is all your love.
all i need from you, is all your love.
all you got to give to me, is all your love.
ooh yeah, ooh yeah.
ooh yeah, ooh yeah.
