i still can remember.
the last time i cried.
i was holding you and loving you.
knowing it would end.

i never felt so good.
yet felt so bad.
you are the one i love.
and what makes it sad.
is you do not belong to me.

and i can remember.
the last time i lied.
i was holding you and telling you.
we could still be friends.

tried to let you go.
but i can not, you know.
and even though i am not with you.
i need you so.
but you do not belong to me.


chorus.
coming in and out of your life.
is not easy.
when there are so many nights.
i can not hold you and i have told you.
these feelings are so hard to find.
coming in and out of your life.
will never free me.
cause i do not need to touch you.
to feel you, its so real with you.

i just can not get you out of my mind.
but i can remember the last time we tried.
each needing more than we could give.
and knowing all the time.
a stronger love.
just can not be found.
even though at times this crazy world.
is turning up side down.
you will always belong to me.

chorus.
