let me tell you bout wayne and his deals of.
cocaine.
a little more every day.
holding for a friend till the band do well.
then the d.e.a. locked him away.

clang clang, go the jail guitar doors.
bang bang, go the boots on the floor.
cry cry, for your lonely mothers son.
clang clang, go the jail guitar doors.

an i will tell you bout pete, did not want no fame.
gave all his money away.
ampquotwell theres something wrong, it will be good for you, sonampquot.
and so they certified him insane.

and then theres keith, waiting for trial.
twenty five thousand bail.
if he goes down you will not hear his sound.
but his friends carry on anyway.
fuck em!
jail guitar doors.
54 46 was my number.
jail guitar doors.
