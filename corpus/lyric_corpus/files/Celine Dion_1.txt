a new day...
a new day...

i was waiting for so long.
for a miracle to come.
everyone told me to be strong.
hold on and do not shed a tear.

through the darkness and good times.
i knew id make it through.
and the world thought i had it all.
but i was waiting for you.

hush, love.

i see a light in the sky.
oh, its almost blinding me.
i can not believe.
i have been touched by an angel with love.

let the rain come down and wash away my tears.
let it fill my soul and drown my fears.
let it shatter the walls for a new sun...

a new day has... come.

where it was dark now theres light.
where there was pain now theres joy.
where there was weakness, i found my strength.
all in the eyes of a boy.

hush, love.

i see a light in the sky.
oh, its almost blinding me.
i can not believe.
i have been touched by an angel with love.

let the rain come down and wash away my tears.
let it fill my soul and drown my fears.
let it shatter the walls for a new sun....

a new day has...

let the rain come down and wash away my tears.
let it fill my soul and drown my fears.
let it shatter the walls for a new sun...

all in the eyes of the boy.

i can not believe.
