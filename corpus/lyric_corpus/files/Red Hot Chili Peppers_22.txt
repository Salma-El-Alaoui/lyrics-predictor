never too soon to be through.
being cool too much too soon.
too much for me too much for you.
you are gonna lose in time.
do not be afraid to show your friends.
that you hurt inside inside.
paings part of life do not hide behind your false pride.
its a lie your lie.

if you see me getting mighty.
if you see me getting high.
knock me down.
i am not bigger than life.

if you see me getting mighty.
if you see me getting high.
knock me down.
i am not bigger than life.

i am tired of being untouchable.
i am not above the love.
i am part of you and you are part of me.
why did you go away.
finding what you are looking for.
can end up being being such a bore.
i pray for you most every day.
my loves with you now fly away.

if you see me getting mighty.
if you see me getting high.
knock me down.
i am not bigger than life.

if you see me getting mighty.
if you see me getting high.
knock me down.
i am not bigger than life.

if you see me getting mighty.
if you see me getting high.
knock me down.
i am not bigger than life.

if you see me getting mighty.
if you see me getting high.
knock me down.
i am not bigger than life.

if you see me getting mighty.
if you see me getting high.
knock me down.
i am not bigger than life.

if you see me getting mighty.
if you see me getting high.
knock me down.
i am not bigger than life.

if you see me getting mighty.
if you see me getting high.
knock me down.
i am not bigger than life.

if you see me getting mighty.
if you see me getting high.
knock me down.
i am not bigger than life.

its so lonely when you do not even know yourself.

its so lonely when you do not even know yourself.
its so lonely.
its so lonely when you do not even know yourself.
its so lonely.
