hes chosen my attic.
i feel it in the static.
he lives in my basement.
and i can hardly face it.
my performance is easy.
i am the god of romance.
and in my confusion.
i have the right to reign.

hes stolen my oscars.
he trades on my jokes.
he makes all my engines go oh oh oh.
he put an e in the arsenal.
a comb in my fro.
devine retribution.
and away we will go.
hey hey hey hey.

somethings happening i can feel it.
moving out of time you will hear it.
falling in the way you fear it.
jumping thumping shout out something.
jumping thumping shout out something.

listen to the radio.
and you will hear the songs you know.
make it effervescent here.
and you might have a job my dear.

i am searching for something.
beyond my understanding.
looking for meaning.
where nothing is demanding.
there are no surprises.
where nothing is expected.
if you offer nothing.
then everyone accepts.

hes stolen my oscars.
he trades on my jokes.
he makes all my engines go oh oh oh.
he put an e in the arsenal.
a comb in my fro.

and away we will go.
