i always flirt with death.
i could kill, but i do not care about it.
i can face your threats.
stand up tall and scream and shout about it.

i think i am on another world with you with you.
i am on another planet with you with you.

you always get under my skin.
i do not find it irritating.
you always play to win.
i do not need rehabilitating.

i think i am on another world with you with you.
i am on another planet with you with you.

another girl, another planet.
another girl, another planet.

space travels in my blood.
and there aingt nothing i can do about it.
long journeys wear me out but.
oh god you know we will not live without it.

i think i am on another world with you with you.
i am on another planet with you with you.

i think i am on another world with you with you.
i am on another planet with you with you.

another girl is loving you now.
another planet, forever holding you down.
another planet.
