and i wanna move the town to the clash city rockers.
you need a little jump of electrical shockers.
you better leave town if you only wanna knock us.
nothing stands the pressure of the clash city rockers.

you see the rate they come down the escalator.
now listen to the tube train accelerator.
then you realise that you got to have a purpose.
or this place is gonna knock you out sooner or later.

so do not complain about your useless employment.
jack it in forever tonight.
or shut your mouth and pretend you enjoy it.
think of all the money you have got.

and i wanna liquefy everybody gone dry.
or plug into the aerials that poke up in the sky.
or burn down the suburbs with the half closed eyes.
you will not succeed unless you try.

so do not complain about your useless employment.
jack it in forever tonight.
or shut your mouth shut it and pretend you enjoy it.
think of all the money you have got, yeah yeah.

yes, i wanna move the town to the clash city rockers.
you need a little jump of electrical shockers.
you better leave town if you only wanna knock us.
nothing stands the pressure of the clash city rockers.

you owe me a move say the bells of st. groove.
come on and show me say the bells of old bowie.
when i am fitter say the bells of gary glitter.
no one but you and i say the bells of prince far i.
no one but you and i say the bells of prince far i.

and i wanna move the town to the clash city rockers.
