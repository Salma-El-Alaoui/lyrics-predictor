you can not manufacture a miracle.
the silence was pitiful   that day.
and love is getting too cynical.
passions just physical   these days.
you analyse everyone you meet.
but get no sign   the loving kind.
every night you admit defeat.
and cry yourself blind.

if you can not wake up in the morning.
cause your bed lies vacant at night.
if you are lost, hurt, tired or lonely.
ca not control it   try as you might.
may you find that love that will not leave you.
may you find it by the end of the day.
you will not be lost, hurt, tired and lonely.
something beautiful will come your way.

the dj said on the radio.
life should be stereo   each day.
and the past that cast the unsuitable.
instead of some kind of beautiful.
you just could not wait.
all your friends think you are satisfied.
but they can not see your soul, no, no, no.
forgot the time feeling petrified.
when they lived alone.

if you can not wake up in the morning.
cause your bed lies vacant at night.
if you are lost, hurt, tired or lonely.
ca not control it   try as you might.
may you find that love that will not leave you.
may you find it by the end of the day.
you will not be lost, hurt, tired and lonely.
something beautiful will come your way.

it will come your way.
it will come your way some kind of beautiful.
it will come your way some kind of beautiful.
it will come your way some kind of beautiful.
it will come your way.

all your friends think you are satisfied.
but they can not see your soul, no, no, no.
forgot the time feeling petrified.
when they lived alone.

if you can not wake up in the morning.
cause your bed lies vacant at night.
if you are lost, hurt, tired or lonely.
ca not control it   try as you might.
may you find that love that will not leave you.
may you find it by the end of the day.
you will not be lost, hurt, tired and lonely.
something beautiful will come your way.
you will not be lost, hurt, tired and lonely.
something beautiful will come your way.
