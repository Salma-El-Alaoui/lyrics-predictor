i am nothing special.
in fact, i am a bit of a bore.
if i tell a joke.
you have probably heard it before.
but i have a talent.
a wonderful thing.
cause everyone listens when i start to sing.
i am so grateful and proud.
all i want is to sing it out loud.
so i say.

thank you for the music.
the songs i am singing.
thanks for all the joy they are bringing.
who can live without it.
i ask in all honesty.
what would life be.
without a song or a dance what are we.
so i say thank you for the music.
for giving it to me.

mother says i was a dancer before i could walk.
mmhmm, she says i began.
to sing long before i could talk.
and i have often wondered.
how did it all start.
who found out that nothing.
can capture a heart.
like a memory can.
well, whoever it was.
i am a fan.
so i say.

thank you for the music.
the songs i am singing.
thanks for all the joy they are bringing.
who can live without it.
i ask in all honesty.
what would life be.
without a song or a dance what are we.
so i say thank you for the music.
for giving it to me.

i have been so lucky.
i am the girl with golden hair.
i wanna sing it out to everybody.
what a joy.
what a life.
what a chance!
so i say.

thank you for the music.
the songs i am singing.
thanks for all the joy they are bringing.
who can live without it.
i ask in all honesty.
what would life be.
without a song or a dance what are we.
so i say thank you for the music.
for giving it.
to me.
