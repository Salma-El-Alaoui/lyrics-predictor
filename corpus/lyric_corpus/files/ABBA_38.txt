people everywhere.
a sense of expectation hanging in the air.
giving out a spark.
across the room your eyes are glowing in the dark.
and here we go again, we know the start, we know the end.
masters of the scene.
we have done it all before and now we are back to get some more.
you know what i mean.

voulez vous.
take it now or leave it.
now is all we get.
nothing promised, no regrets.
voulez vous.
aingt no big decision.
you know what to do.
la question cest voulez vous.

i know what you think.
the girl means business so i will offer her a drink.

i am really glad you came, you know the rules, you know the game.
master of the scene.
we have done it all before and now we are back to get some more.
