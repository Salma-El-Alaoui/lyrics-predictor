now the king told the boogie men.
you have to let that raga drop.
the oil down the desert way.
has been shaking to the top.
the sheik he drove his cadillac.
he went a cruising down the ville.
the muezzin was a standing.
on the radiator grille.

chorus.
the shareef do not like it.
rocking the casbah.
rock the casbah.
the shareef do not like it.
rocking the casbah.
rock the casbah.

by order of the prophet.
we ban that boogie sound.
degenerate the faithful.
with that crazy casbah sound.
but the bedouin they brought out.
the electric camel drum.
the local guitar picker.
got his guitar picking thumb.
as soon as the shareef.
had cleared the square.
they began to wail.

chorus.

now over at the temple.
oh! they really pack em in.
the in crowd say its cool.
to dig this chanting thing.
but as the wind changed direction.
and the temple band took five.
the crowd caught a wiff.
of that crazy casbah jive.

chorus.

the king called up his jet fighters.
he said you better earn your pay.
drop your bombs between the minarets.
down the casbah way.

as soon as the shareef was.
chauffeured outta there.
the jet pilots tuned to.
the cockpit radio blare.

as soon as the shareef was.
outta their hair.
the jet pilots wailed.

chorus.

he thinks its not kosher.
fundamentally he can not take it.
you know he really hates it..
