sleeping very soundly on a saturday morning.
i was dreaming i was al capone.
theres rumor going round, gotta clear outta town.
i am smelling like a dry fish bone.
here comes the law, gonna break down the door.
gonna carry me away once more.
never, never, never want it any more.
gotta get away from this stone cold floor.

crazy.
stone cold crazy, you know.

rainy afternoon, i got a blow a typhoon.
playing on my slide trombone.
anymore, anymore, cannot take it anymore.
gotta get away from this stone cold floor.

crazy.
stone cold crazy, you know.

walking down the street.
shooting people that i meet.
fully loaded tommy gun.
here comes the deputy, try fucking getting me.
gotta fucking get up and run.
they got the sirens loose.
i run right outta juice.
they are gonna put me in a cell, if i can not go to heaven.
will they let me go to hell?

crazy.
stone cold crazy, you know.
