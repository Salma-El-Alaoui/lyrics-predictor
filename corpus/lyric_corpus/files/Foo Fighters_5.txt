i have got another confession to make.
i am your fool.
everyones got their chains to break.
holding you.
were you born to resist or be abused?
is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
are you gone and onto someone new?

i needed somewhere to hang my head.
without your noose.
you gave me something that i did not have.
but had no use.
i was too weak to give in.
too strong to lose.
my heart is under arrest again.
but i break loose.
my head is giving me life or death.
but i can not choose.
i swear i will never give in.
i refuse.

is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
has someone taken your faith?
its real, the pain you feel.
your trust, you must.
confess.

oh...

oh.
oh.

has someone taken your faith?
its real, the pain you feel.
the life, the love.
youd die to heal.
the hope that starts.
the broken hearts.
your trust, you must.
confess.
