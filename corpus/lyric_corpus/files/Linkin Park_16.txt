wake in a sweat again.
another days been laid to waste.
in my disgrace.
stuck in my head again.
feels like i will never leave this place.
theres no escape.

i am my own worst enemy.

i have given up, i am sick of feeling.
is there nothing you can say?
take this all away, i am suffocating.
tell me what the fuck is wrong with me.

i do not know what to take.
thought i was focused, but i am scared.
i am not prepared.
i hyperventilate.
looking for help, somehow, somewhere.
and no one cares.

i am my own worst enemy.

i have given up, i am sick of feeling.
is there nothing you can say?
take this all away, i am suffocating.
tell me what the fuck is wrong with me.

god!

put me out of my misery!
put me out of my misery!
put me out of my.
put me out of my fucking misery!

i have given up, i am sick of feeling.
is there nothing you can say?
take this all away, i am suffocating.
tell me what the fuck is wrong with me.
