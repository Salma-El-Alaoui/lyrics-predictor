i wake up with blood shot eyes.
struggled to memorize.
the way it felt between your thighs.
pleasure that made you cry.
feels so good to be bad.
not worth the aftermath, after that, after that.
try to get you back.

i still do not have the reason.
and you do not have the time.
and it really makes me wonder.
if i ever gave a fuck about you.

give me something to believe in.
cause i do not believe in you.
anymore, anymore.
i wonder if it even makes a difference to try.
yeah, so this is goodbye.

god damn, my spinning head.
decisions that made my bed.
now i must lay in it.
and deal with things i left unsaid.
i want to dive into you.
what you are going through.
i get behind, make your move.

i still do not have the reason.
and you do not have the time.
and it really makes me wonder.
if i ever gave a fuck about you.

give me something to believe in.
cause i do not believe in you.
anymore, anymore.
i wonder if it even makes a difference... it even makes a difference to try.
yeah.

and you told me how you are feeling.
but i do not believe its true.
anymore, anymore.
i wonder if it even makes a difference to try.
so this is goodbye.

i have been here before.
one day i will wake up.
and it will not hurt anymore.
you caught me in a lie.
i have no alibi.
the words you say do not have a meaning.

cause i, still do not have the reason.
and you do not have the time.
and it really makes me wonder.
if i ever gave a fuck about you and i.
and so this is goodbye.

give me something to believe in.
cause i do not believe in you.
anymore, anymore.
i wonder if it even makes a difference... it even makes a difference to try.
yeah.

and you told me how you are feeling.
but i do not believe its true.
anymore, anymore.
i wonder if it even makes a difference to try.
so this is goodbye.

so this is goodbye.
yeah, so this is goodbye.
yeah, so this is goodbye..
