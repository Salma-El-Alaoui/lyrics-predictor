ah... oo...

this is the way.
i always dreamed it would be.
the way that it is, oh.
when you are holding me.
i never had a love of my own.
maybe thats why when we are all alone.

i can hear music.
i can hear music.
the sound of the city baby.
seems to disappear, oh when.
i can hear music.
sweet sweet music.
whenever you touch me baby.
whenever you are near.

loving you.
it keeps me satisfied.
and i can not explain, oh no.
the way i am feeling inside.
you look at me, we kiss and then.
i close my eyes and here it comes again.

i can hear music.
i can hear music.
the sound of the city baby.
seems to disappear, oh when.
i can hear music.
sweet sweet music.
whenever you touch me baby.
whenever you are near.

i hear the music all the time, yeah.
i hear the music hold me tight now baby.
i hear the music all the time.
i hear the music.
i hear the music baby.

ahh...

i can hear music.
i can hear music.
the sound of the city baby.
seems to disappear, oh when.
i can hear music.
sweet sweet music.
whenever you touch me baby.
whenever you are near.
