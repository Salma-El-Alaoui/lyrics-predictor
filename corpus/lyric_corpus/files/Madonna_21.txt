spoken.
como puede ser verdad.

last night i dreamt of san pedro.
just like id never gone, i knew the song.
a young girl with eyes like the desert.
it all seems like yesterday, not far away.

chorus.
tropical the island breeze.
all of nature wild and free.
this is where i long to be.
la isla bonita.
and when the samba played.
the sun would set so high.
ring through my ears and sting my eyes.
your spanish lullaby.

i fell in love with san pedro.
warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me.
te dijo te amo.
i prayed that the days would last.
they went so fast.

chorus.

i want to be where the sun warms the sky.
when its time for siesta you can watch them go by.
beautiful faces, no cares in this world.
where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl.

last night i dreamt of san pedro.
it all seems like yesterday, not far away.

chorus tree times.

la la la la la la la.

te dijo te amo.

la la la la la la la.

el dijo que te ama.

la isla bonita.
