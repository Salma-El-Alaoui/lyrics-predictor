listen.

to the song here in my heart.
a melody i start but can not complete.
listen.
to the sound from deep within.
its only beginning to find release.
oh, the time has come.
for my dreams to be heard.
they will not be pushed aside and turned.
into your own, all cause you will not listen.

listen.
i am alone at a crossroads.
i am not at home in my own home.
and i have tried and tried.
to say whats on my mind.
you should have known.

oh, now i am done believing you.
you do not know what i am feeling.
i am more than what you made of me.
i have followed the voice you gave to me.
but now i have gotta find my own.

you should have listened.
there is someone here inside.
someone i thought had died so long ago.
oh, i am screaming out.
and my dreams will be heard.
they will not be pushed aside or worse.
into your own, all cause you will not listen.

listen.
i am alone at a crossroads.
i am not at home in my own home.
and i have tried and tried.
to say whats on my mind.
you should have known.

oh, now i am done believing you.
you do not know what i am feeling.
i am more than what you made of me.
i have followed the voice you gave to me.
but now i have gotta find my own.

i do not know where i belong.
but i will be moving on.
if you do not, if you will not.
listen.
to the song here in my heart.
a melody i start but i will complete.

oh, now i am done believing you.
you do not know what i am feeling.
i am more than what you made of me.
i have followed the voice you think you gave to me.
but now i have got to find my own, my own.
