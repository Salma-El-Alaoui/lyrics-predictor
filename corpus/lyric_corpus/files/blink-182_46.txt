i took her out, it was a friday night.
i wore cologne to get the feeling right.
we started making out and she took off my pants.
but then i turned on the tv.

and thats about the time she walked away from me.
nobody likes you when you are 23.
and are still more amused by tv shows.

then later on, on the drive home.
i called her mom from a pay phone.
i said i was the cops and your husbands in jail.

and thats about the time that bitch hung up on me.
nobody likes you when you are 23.
and are still more amused by prank phone calls.

my friends say i should act my age.

and thats about the time she walked away from me.
nobody likes you when you are 23.
and you still act like you are in freshman year.
what the hell is wrong with me?
my friends say i should act my age.
whats my age again?
