verse.
tell me where.
where is it written.
what it is i am meant to be?
that i can not dare...

it all began the day i found.
that from my window.
i could only see.
a piece of sky.
i stepped outside and looked around.
i never dreamed it was so wide.
or even half as high.

the time had come.
papa, can you hear me? .
to try my wings.
papa, are you near me? .
and even thought it seemed at any moment i could fall.
i felt the most.
papa, can you see me? .
amazing things.
can you understand me? .
the things you can not imagine.
if you have never flown at all.

though its safer to stay on the ground.
sometimes where danger lies.
there the sweetest of pleasures are found.


no matter where i go .
there will be memries that tug at my sleeve.
but there will also be.
more to question yet more to believe.

oh tell me where .
where is the someone who will turn to look at me.
and want to sahre.
my evry sweet imagined possibility? .

the more i live   the more i learn.
the more i learn   the more i realize.
the less i know.
each step i take .
papa, i have a voice now!
each page i turn .
papa, i have a choice now!
each mile i travel only means.
the more i have to go.
whats wrong with wanting more?
if you can fly   then soar!
with all there is   why settle for.
just a piece of sky?

papa, i can hear you...
papa, i can see you...
papa, i can feel you...
papa, watch me fly!
