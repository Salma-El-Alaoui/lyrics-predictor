it aingt easy, living like a gypsy.
tell ya, honey, how i feel.
i have been dreaming.
floating down stream and.
losing touch with all that is real.
whole earth lover, keeping under cover.
never knowing where ya been.
you have been fading, always out parading.
keeping touch with mama kin.

well you have always got your tail on the wag.
shooting fire from your mouth just like a dragon.
you act like a perpertual drag.
you better check it out.
cause someday soon you will have to climb back on the wagon.

it aingt easy, living like you wanna.
and its so hard to find piece of mind.
yes it is.
the way i see it, you have got to say shit.
but do not forget to drop me a line.

said you are as bald as an egg at eighteen.
and working for you dad is just a drag.
he still stuffs your mouth with your dreams.
you better check it out.
cause someday soon you will have to climb back on the wagon.

chorus.
keeping touch with mama kin.
tell her where you have gone and been.
living out your fantasy.
sleeping late and smoking tea.

chorus.
