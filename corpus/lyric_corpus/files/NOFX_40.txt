you have got the beauty, but that do not mean a thing.

a bland reciprocation, but that dose not bother me.

you are happier with lights on underneath a darkened sky.

only in the spotlight can you tell me of your crimes.

i understand the situation, but i can not.

seem to understand the motivations you once had.

i recall a message i once left behind a screen.

i was entranced, when you were never there for me.

you are draining, you are draining me, i am not a tub.

what ever happened to the girl i used to hold?

i held in such a high regard.

where is the girl who had it all?

i used to think i was not worthy of your cause.

i used to feel so lucky.

until the day i felt a weakness in my arms.

i knew from where it had been coming.

you are bleeding, you are bleeding me, i can recall.

the passions you once had, where did they go?

i knew a girl who had it all?

i knew a girl where did she go?
