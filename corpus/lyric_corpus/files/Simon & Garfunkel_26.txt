old friends, old friends.
sat on their parkbench like bookends.
a newspaper blown through the grass.
falls on the round toes.
of the high shoes of the old friends.

old friends, winter companions, the old men.
lost in their overcoats, waiting for the sunset.
the sounds of the city sifting through trees.
settle like dust on the shoulders of the old friends.

can you imagine us years from today.
sharing a parkbench quietly.
how terribly strange to be seventy.

old friends, memory brushes the same years.
silently sharing the same fears.

time it was.
and what a.
time it was.
it was.
a time of innocence.
a time of confidences.

long ago.
it must be.
i have a photograph.
preserve your memories.
they are all thats left you..
