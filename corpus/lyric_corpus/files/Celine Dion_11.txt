i had to escape.
the city was sticky and cruel.
maybe i should have called you first.
but i was dying to get to you.
i was dreaming while i drove.
the long straight road ahead,uh huh yea.

could taste your sweet kisses.
your arms open wide.
this fever for you is just burning me up inside.

i drove all night..... to get to you.
is that alright?
i drove all night...........
crept in your room.
woke you from your sleep.
to make love to you.
is that alright?
i drove all night.

what in this world.
keeps us from falling apart?
no matter where i go i hear.
the beating of one heart.
i think about you.
when the night is cold and dark, uh huh yea.
no one can move me.
the way that you do.
nothing erases this feeling between me and you.

i drove all night....... to get to you.
is that alright?
i drove all night........
crept in your room.
woke you from your sleep.
