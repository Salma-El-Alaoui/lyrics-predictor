i do not know you but i think i hate you.
you are the reason for my misery.
strange how you have become my biggest enemy.
and i have never even seen your face.

maybe its just jealousy.
mixing up with a violent mind.
a circumstance that does not make much sense.
or maybe i am just dumb.

you are the cloud hanging out over my head.
hail comes crashing down welting my face.
magic man, egocentric plastic man.
yet you still got one over on me.

maybe its just jealousy.
mixing up with a violent mind.
a circumstance that does not make much sense.
or maybe i am just dumb.

i am a chump.
