you, you know how to get me so low.
my heart had a crash when we spoke.
i can not fix what you broke.

you, you always have a reason.
again and again this feeling.
why do i give in.

and i always was.
always was one for crying.
i always was one for tears.

the suns getting cold, its snowing.
looks like an early winter for us.
looks like an early winter for us.
an early winter.
oh, i need you to turn me over.

its sad the map of the world is on you.
the moon gravitates around you.
the seasons escape you.

and i always was.
always was one for crying.
i always was one for tears.

no, i never was.
never was one for lying.
you lied to me all these years.

the suns getting cold, its snowing.
looks like an early winter for us.
looks like an early winter for us.
an early winter.
oh, i need you to turn me over.

why? why do you act so stupid.
why? you know that i am always right.

it looks like an early winter for us.
it hurts and i can not remember sunlight.
an early winter for us.
the leaves are changing color for us.

and it gets too much, yeah, it gets so much.
starting over and over and over again.
and it gets too much, yeah, it gets so much.
starting over and over and over again.
and it gets too much, yeah, it gets so much.
starting over and over and over again.
