every weeks the same.
stuck in schools so lame.
my parents say that i am lazy.
getting up at 8 ams crazy.

tired of being told what to do.
so unfair.
so uncool.

the days too long.
and i am holding on.
til i hear the bell ring.

cause thats time when we are gonna.
time when we are gonna.

chorus.
breakout.
let the party start.
we are gonna stay out.
gonna break some hearts.
we are gonna dance till the dance floor falls apart.
uh oh, all over again.
we are gonna wake up everyone we know.
we are gonna have some fun, gonna lose control.
feels so good, to let go oh oh.

hanging outs just something we like to do.
my friends and the mess we get into.
these are the lessons that we choose.
not a book full of things we will never use.

chorus.

i wish it would never end.
spending time with my friends.
oh with my friends!

chorus x2 .
