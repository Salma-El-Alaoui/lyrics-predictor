it is so easy to see.
dysfunction between you and me.
we must free up these tired souls.
before the sadness kills us both.

i have tried and tried.
to let you know.
i love you.
but i am letting go.
it may not last.
but i do not know.
i just do not know.

if you do not know.
then you can not care.
say you will show up.
but you are not there.
but i am waiting.
and you want to.
still afraid that i will desert you.

everyday.
with every worthless word.
we get more far away.
the distance between us.
makes it so hard to stay.
but nothing lasts forever.
but be honest babe.
it hurts but it may be the only way.

a bed thats warm with memories.
can heal us temporarily.
but misbehaving only makes.
the ditch between us so damn deep.

built a wall around my heart.
never let it fall apart.
but strangely i wish secretly.
it would fall down while i am asleep.

if you do not know.
then you can not care.
say you will show up.
but you are not there.
but i am waiting.
and you want to.
still afraid that i will desert you, babe.

everyday.
with every worthless word.
we get more far away.
the distance between us.
makes it so hard to stay.
but nothing lasts forever.
but be honest babe.
it hurts but it may be the only way.

though we have not hit the ground.
does not mean we are not still falling.
oh, i want so bad to pick you up.
but you are still too.
reluctant to accept my help.
what a shame.
i hope you find somewhere to place the blame.
but until then the fact remains.

everyday.
with every worthless word.
we get more far away.
the distance between us.
makes it so hard to stay.
but nothing lasts forever.
but be honest babe.
it hurts but it may be the only way.
