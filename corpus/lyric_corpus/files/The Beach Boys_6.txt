catch a wave and you are sitting on top of the world.

do not be afraid to try the greatest sport around.
everybody tries it once.
those who do not just have to put it down.
you paddle out turn around and raise.
and baby thats all there is to the coastline craze.
you gotta catch a wave and you are sitting on top of the world.

not just a fad cause its been going on so long.
all the surfers going strong.
they said it would not last too long.
they will eat their words with a fork and spoon.
and watch em they will hit the road and all be surfing soon.
and when they catch a wave they will be sitting on top of the world.

catch a wave and your sitting on top of the world.

so take a lesson from a top notch surfer boy.
every saturday boy.
but do not treat it like a toy.
just get away from the shady turf.
and baby go catch some rays on the sunny surf.
and when you catch a wave you will be sittin on top of the world.

catch a wave and you will be sitting on top of the world.
catch a wave and you will be sitting on top of the world.
catch a wave and you will be sitting on top of the world.
