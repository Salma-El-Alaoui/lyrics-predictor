daydreamer, sittin?? on the seat.
soaking up the sun he is a.
real lover, makin?? up the past and feeling up his girl like he??s never felt her figure before.
her joy ..?
looks good when he when he walks, he is the subject of their talk.
he would be hard to chase, but good to catch and he could change the world with his hands behind his back, oh?

you can find him sittin?? on your doorstep.
waiting for the surprise.
it will feel like he??s been there for hours.
and you can tell that he??ll be there for life.

daydreamer, with eyes that make you melt.
he lends his coat for shelter because he??s there for you when he shouldn??t be.
but he stays all the same, waits for you and then sees you through.
there??s no way i could describe him.
all i say is, just what i??m hoping for.

but i will find him sittin?? on my doorstep.
waiting for the surprise.
it will feel like he??s been there for hours.
and i can tell he??ll be there for life.
and i can tell he??ll be there for life.
