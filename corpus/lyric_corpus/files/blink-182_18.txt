in the car, i just can not wait.
to pick you up on our very first date.
is it cool if i hold your hand?
is it wrong if i think its lame to dance?
do you like my stupid hair?
would you guess that i did not know what to wear?
i am just scared of what you think.
you make me nervous so i really can not eat.

lets go  .
do not wait  .
this nights almost over.
honest  .
lets make  .
this night last forever.
forever, and ever... lets make this last forever.
forever, and ever... lets make this last forever.

when you smile, i melt inside.
i am not worthy for a minute of your time.
i really wish it was only me and you.
i am jealous of everybody in the room.
please do not look at me with those eyes.
please do not hint that your capable of lies.
i dreamt the thought of our very first kiss.
a target that i am probably gonna miss.

lets go  .
do not wait  .
this nights almost over.
honest  .
lets make  .
this night last forever.
forever, and ever... lets make this last forever.
forever, and ever... lets make this last forever.

lets go  .
do not wait  .
this nights almost over.
honest  .
lets make  .
this night last forever.
forever,and ever... lets make this last forever.
forever,and ever... lets make this last forever.

forever,and ever... lets make this last forever.
forever,and ever... lets make this last forever!
