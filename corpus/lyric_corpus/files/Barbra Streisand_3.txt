no more talk of darkness.
forget these wide eyed fears.
i am here.
nothing can harm you.
my words will warm and calm you.
let me be your freedom.
let daylight dry your tears.
i am here.
with you, beside you.
to guard you and to guide you.

say you love me every winter morning.
turn my head with talk of summertime.
say you need me with you now and always.
promise me that all you say is true.
thats all i ask of you.

let me be your shelter.
let me be your light.
you are safe.
no one will find you.
your fears are far behind you.

all i want is freedom.
a world with no more night.
and you.
always beside me.
to hold me and to hide me.
then say you will share with me one love.
one lifetime.
let me lead you from your solitude.
say you need me with you.
here beside you.
anywhere you go, let me go too.
christine thats all i ask of you.

say you will share with me one love, one lifetime.
say the word and i will follow you.
share each day with me.
each night, each morning.
say you love me you know i do.
love me.
thats all i ask of you.

anywhere you go, let me go too.
love me.
thats all i ask of you.
