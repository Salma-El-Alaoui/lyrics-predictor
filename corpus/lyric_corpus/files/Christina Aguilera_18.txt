he comes from a foreign place.
from an island far away.
intrigues me with every move.
till i am breathless, i am helpless.
ca not keep my cool.
steals my heart when he takes my hand.
and we dance, to the rhythm of the band.
i feel his finger tips, grip my hips.
and i slip as we dip into a state of bliss.

mama used to warn me.
to beware of those latin lovers.
she said i gave my heart too soon.
and thats how i became your mother.
i said ay mama, you seem to forget.
i am not in love yet.
sweet talk do not win me over.
but i realized.
big brown eyes can hypnotize.
when he says.

chorus.
i am full blood boricua.
reads the tattoo on his arm.
he tells me, mami i need ya.
and my heartbeat pumps so strong.
getting lost in el ritmo.
he whispers te quiero, te quiero.
i begin to give in with no hesitation.
ca not help my infatuation.
its pure infatuation.

skin the color of cinnamon.
his eyes light up and i melt within.
feels so good it must be a sin.
i can not stop what i started.
i am giving in.
he brings life to my fantasies.
sparks a passion inside of me.
finds the words when i can not speak.
in the silence, his heartbeat is music to me.

but mama used to warn me.
not to rush love with another.
she said i am not trying to lecture.
i just care about my daughter.
ay mama, you seem to forget.
i never will let.
a man control my emotions.
but when he smiles when he smiles.
i feel like a little child.
when he says.

chorus.

caught between my mamas words.
and what i feel inside.
i am wanting to explore his world.
but part of me wants to hide.
should i risk it, can not resist it.
this has caught me by surprise.
should i, let him take me to puerto rico.
i can not hold back no more.
let us go tonight...

papi hold me, say that you adore me.
never let go never leave me lonely.

chorus.

i can not help what i am feeling.
i am infatuated its pure infatuation.
ca not help my infatuation.
papi hold me, say that you adore me.
never let go never leave me lonely.

its pure infatuation.
