when we were young our future was so bright whoa, oh!
the old neighborhood was so alive whoa, oh!
and every kid on the whole damn street whoa, oh!
was gonna make it big and not be beat.

now the neighborhoods cracked and torn whoa, oh!
the kids are grown up but their lives are worn whoa, oh!
how can one little street.
swallow so many lives.

chances thrown.
nothings free.
longing for, used to be.
still its hard.
hard to see.
fragile lives, shattered dreams.
whoa!

jamie had a chance, well she really did whoa, oh!
instead she dropped out and had a couple of kids whoa, oh!
mark still lives at home cause hes got no job whoa, oh!
he just plays guitar and smokes a lot of pot.

jay committed suicide whoa, oh!
brandon odd and died whoa, oh!
what the hell is going on.
the cruelest dream, reality.

chances thrown.
nothings free.
longing for, used to be.
still its hard.
hard to see.
fragile lives, shattered dreams.

chances thrown.
