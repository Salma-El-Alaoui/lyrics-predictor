summer stretching on the grass.
summer dresses pass.
in the shade of a willow tree.
creeps a crawling over me.
over me and over you.
stuck together with gods glue.
its going to get stickier too.

its been a long hot summer.
let us get under cover.
do not try too hard to think.
do not think at all.

i am not the only one.
staring at the sun.
afraid of what you will find.
if you took a look inside.
i am not just deaf and dumb.
staring at the sun.
not the only one.
whos happy to go blind.

theres an insect in your ear.
if you scratch it will not disappear.
its gonna itch and burn and sting.
you want to see what the scratching brings.
waves that leave me out of reach.
breaking on your back like a beach.
will we ever live in peace?

cause those that can not do.
often have to.
and those that can not do.
often have to preach.

to the ones.
staring at the sun.
afraid of what youd find.
if you took a look inside.
not just deaf and dumb.
i am staring at the sun.
i am not the only one.
whod rather go blind.

intransigence is all around.
military still in town.
armour plated suits and ties.
daddy just will not say goodbye.
referee will not blow the whistle.
god is good but will he listen.
i am nearly great.
but theres something missing.

i left it in the duty free area.
but you never really belonged to me.

you are not the only one.
staring at the sun.
afraid of what youd find.
you step back inside.
not sucking on my thumb.
i am staring at the sun.
i am not the only one.
whos happy to go blind.
