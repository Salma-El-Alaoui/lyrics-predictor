my eyes have seen you.
my eyes have seen you.
my eyes have seen you.
stand in your door.
meet inside.
show me some more.
show me some more.
show me some more.

my eyes have seen you.
my eyes have seen you.
my eyes have seen you.
turn and stare.
fix your hair.
move upstairs.
move upstairs.
move upstairs.

my eyes have seen you.
my eyes have seen you.
my eyes have seen you.
free from disguise.
gazing on a city.
under television skies.
television skies.
television skies.

my eyes have seen you.
my eyes have seen you.
eyes have seen you.
let them photograph your soul.
memorize your alleys.
on an endless roll.
endless roll.
endless roll.
endless roll.
endless roll.
endless roll.
endless roll.
endless roll.
endless roll.
endless roll.
endless roll.
endless roll.
endless roll.
endless roll.
