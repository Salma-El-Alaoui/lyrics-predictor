i am the next act.
waiting in the wings.
i am an animal.
trapped in your hot car.

i am all the days.
that you choose to ignore.

you are all i need.
you are all i need.
i am in the middle of your picture.
lying in the reeds.

i am a moth.
who just wants to share your light.
i am just an insect.
trying to get out of the night.

i only stick with you.
because there are no others.

you are all i need.
you are all i need.
i am in the middle of your picture.
lying in the reeds.

its all wrong, its all right.
its all wrong, its all right.
its all wrong, its all right.
its all wrong, its all right.
its all, its all.
