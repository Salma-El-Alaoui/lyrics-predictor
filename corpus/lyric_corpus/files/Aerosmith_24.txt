long ago in days i am told.
were ruled by lords of greed.
maidens fared with gold they dared.
to bare their wombs that bleed.
kings and queens and guillotines.
taking lives denied.
starch and parchment laid the laws.
when bishops took the ride.
only to deceive.

oh i know i lived this life before.
somehow know now truths i must be sure.
tossin, turning nightmares burning.
dreams of swords in hand.
sailing ships the viking spits.
the blood of fathers land.
only to deceive.

living times of knights and mares.
raising swords for maidens fair.
sneer at death.
fear only loss of pride.

living other centuries.
deja vu or what you please.
follows true to all who do or die.

screams of no reply.
they died.
screams of no reply.
and died.
lordy lordy they died.
lordy lordy they died.

live and do or die.
they died.
live and no reply.
they died.
