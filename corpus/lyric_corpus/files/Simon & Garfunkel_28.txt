wish i was a kelloggs cornflake.
floating in my bowl taking movies.
relaxing awhile, living in style.
talking to a raisin who casionly plays l.a..
casually glancing at his toupee.

wish i was an english muffin.
bout to make the most out of a toaster.

id ease myself down.
coming up brown.

i prefer boysenberry.
more than any ordinary jam.
i am a citizens for boysenberry jam fan.

ah, south california.

if i become a first lieutenant.
would you put my photo on your piano?
to maryjane  .
best wishes, martin.
old roger draft dodger.
leaving by the basement door.
everybody knows what hes.
tippy toeing down there for.
