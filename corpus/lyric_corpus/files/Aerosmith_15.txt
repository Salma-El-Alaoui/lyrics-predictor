i got a rip in my pants and a hole in my brand new shoes.
i got a margarita nose and a breath full of mad dog booze.

chorus.
i got the fever, fever, fever, fever.

yeah, they threw me outa jail i tell ya it aingt fair.
i tried to kiss the judge from the electrica chair.
yeah we are all here cause we are not all there tonight.

the guitars cranked and the bass mans blown a fuse.
and when the whole gang bangs tell me then whats you are excuse.

we got the fever, fever, fever, fever.

fever gives ya lust with an appetite.
it hits ya like the fangs from a rattlesnake bite.
we are all here cause we are not all there tonight.

we can not run away from trouble.
there aingt no place that far.
but if we do it right at the speed of light.
theres the back seat of my car, caviar.

i was feeling so high i forgot what day.
now i am feelin low down even slow seems way too fast.
and now the booze do not work and the drugs ran out of gas.

chorus.

the buzz that you be getting from the crack do not last.
id rather be o.d.ing on the crack of her ass.
yeah we are all here cause we are not all there tonight.

my first time ever lover.
we fell asleep out on the lawn.
and when i woke up i was all alone.
making love to the crack of dawn.
so yo, i beg yo pardon sir.
the gangster of love rides again.

i got the fever.
you know i get a chill.
fever.
it gimme such a thrill.
fever.
like a burning plague.
fever.
yeah get outta my way.

fever may be hell and a cross to bear.
as long as i am in heaven honey i do not care.
you look so good baby look so fine.
i tell you you are the image of the perfect crime.
you gets so tired holding on so tight.
if you think you are going crazy well you may be right.
yeah, we are all here cause we are not all there, thats right.
