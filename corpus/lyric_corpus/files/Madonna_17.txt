mmmm, mmmm.
say good bye to not knowing when.
the truth in my whole life began.
say good bye to not knowing how to cry.
you taught me that.

chorus first time substitute quotstrengthquot for quotlovequot and quotsavedquot for quotchangedquot.

and i will remember the love that you gave me.
now that i am standing on my own.
i will remember the way that you changed me.
i will remember.

inside i was a child.
that could not mend a broken wing.
outside i looked for a way.
to teach my heart to sing.

chorus.

i learned to let go of the illusion that we can possess.
i learned to let go, i travel in stillness.
and i will remember happiness.
i will remember i will remember.
mmmmm... i will remember.
mmmmm...

chorus.
i will remember.

no i have never been afraid to cry.
now i finally have a reason why.
i will remember i will remember.
repeat 3 times, substituting quotandquot for quotnowquot the second and third times.
