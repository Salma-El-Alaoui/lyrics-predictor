my mother was a witch, she was burned alive.
nameless little bitch, oh the tears i cried.
take her down now, do not want to see her face.
all blistered and burnt, can not hide my disgrace.

twenty seven, everyone was nice.
gotta see em make em pay the price.
see their bodies out on the ice.
take my time.

am i evil? yes i am.
am i evil? i am man, yes i am.

as i watched my mother die, i lost my head.
revenge now i sought, to break with my bread.
taking no chances, you come with me.
i will split you to the bone, help set you free.

twenty seven, everyone was nice.
