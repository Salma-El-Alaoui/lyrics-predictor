shut my eyes.
feel the colour of you.
so get to this elation.
so high so fast.

shut my eyes.
feel the colour of you.
succumb to this illusion.
so strong so deep.

cos everyday is all there is.
in my some kind of bliss.
cos everyday is all there is.
in my some kind of bliss.

study my reflection.
and let the colours fall.
slip into stillness.
and be above it all.

good to be here.
time to be alone.
i have found a space where i belong.
not succumb to fear.

cos everyday is all there is.
in my some kind of bliss.
cos everyday is all there is.
in my some kind of bliss.
