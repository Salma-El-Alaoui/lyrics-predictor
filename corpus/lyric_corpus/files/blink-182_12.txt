the drops of rain they fall all over.
this awkward silence makes me crazy.
the glow inside burns light upon her.
i will try to kiss you if you let me.
this can not be the end.

tidal waves they rip right through me.
tears from eyes worn cold and sad.
pick me up now, i need you so bad.

down down down down.
down down down down.
down down down down.
down down down down.
it gets me so.
down down down down.
down down down down.
down down down down.
down down down down.
it gets me so.

your vows of silence fall all over.
the look in your eyes makes me crazy.
i feel the darkness break upon her.
i will take you over if you let me.
you did this.

tidal waves they rip right through me.
tears from eyes worn cold and sad.
pick me up now, i need you so bad.

down down down down.
down down down down.
down down down down.
down down down down.
it gets me so.
down down down down.
down down down down.
down down down down.
down down down down.
it gets me so.
