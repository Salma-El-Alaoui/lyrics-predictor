well, i guess it would be nice.
if i could touch your body.
i know not everybody.
has got a body like you.

oh, but i gotta think twice.
before i give my heart away.
and i know all the games you play.
because i play them, too.

oh, but i need some time off from that emotion.
time to pick my heart up off the floor.
and when that love comes down without devotion.
well, it takes a strong man baby, but i am.
showing you the door.

cause i gotta have faith.
i gotta have... faith.
because i have gotta have faith, faith, faith.
i gotta have faith, faith, faith.

baby, i know you are asking me to stay.
saying please, please, please do not go away.
you say i am giving you the blues.

maybe you mean every word you say.
ca not help but think of yesterday.
and another who tied me down to loverboy rules.

before this river becomes an ocean.
before you throw my heart back on the floor.
oh baby, i reconsider my foolish notion.
well, i need someone to hold me.
but i will wait for something more.

cause i gotta have faith...
repeat chorus.

before this river.
becomes an ocean.
before you throw my heart back on the floor.
i have just got to have faith.
i have reconsidered my foolish notion.

yeah, i need someone to hold me.
but i will wait for something more....

pause.

cause i gotta have faith.
final chorus.
