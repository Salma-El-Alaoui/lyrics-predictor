what ever never knew.
that i could feel so good.
smile in your eyes.
what ever never knew.
that i could walk through wood.
i guess i never tried.
a million years old.
but just a little girl.
vibing off the gong.
rubbing on the bowls.
make you float around.
make your loving strong.

and when we get.
in the same place.
at the same time.
it is your grace.
that i want to.
fall right into now.
to love avow.

i am falling into grace with you.
i am falling into guru muhk.
i am falling into grace with you.
i am falling into guru muhk.

she moves in a rapture.
that her capsule might.
land on your star.
meditating in the morning.
head dressed in white.
beauty bazaar.

you can smell the purple light.
coming home her heart.
get lost and wet.
i treat you like a teacher.
cause thats what you are.
i wanna be your pet.

and when we get.
in the same place.
at the same time.
it is your grace.
that i want to.
fall right into now.
to love avow.
