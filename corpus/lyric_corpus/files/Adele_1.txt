wait, do you see my heart on my sleeve?
its been there for days on end and.
its been waiting for you to open up.
just you baby, come on now.
i am trying to tell you just how.
id like to hear the words roll out of your mouth finally.
say that its always been me.

thats made you feel a way you have never felt before.
and i am all you need and that you never want more.
then youd say all of the right things without a clue.
but youd save the best for last.
like i am the one for you.

you should know that you are just a temporary fix.
this is not rooted with you it do not mean that much to me.
you are just a filler in the space that happened to be free.
how dare you think youd get away with trying to play me.

why is it everytime i think i have tried my hardest.
it turns out it aingt enough cause you are still not mentioning love.
what am i supposed to do to make you want me properly?
i am taking these chances and getting away.
and though i am trying my hardest you back to her.
and i think that i know things may never change.
i am still hoping one day i might hear you say.

i make you feel a way you have never felt before.
and i am all you need and that you never want more.
then youd say all of the right things without a clue.
but youd save the best for last.
like i am the one for you.

you should know that you are just a temporary fix.
this is not rooted with you it do not mean that much to me.
you are just a filler in the space that happened to be free.
how dare you think youd get away with trying to play me.

but, despite the truth that i know.
i find it hard to let go and give up on you.
seems i love the things you do.
like the meaner you treat me the more eager i am.
to persist with this heartbreak and running around.
and i think that i know things may never change.
i am still hoping one day i might hear you say.

i make you feel a way you have never felt before.
and i am all you need and that you never want more.
and we will say all of the right things without a clue.
and you will be the one for me and me the one for you.
