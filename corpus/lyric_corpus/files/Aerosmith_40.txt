in the attic, lights.
voices scream, nothing seems.
reals a dream.

leaving the things that are real behind.
leaving the things that you love from mind.
all of the things that you learned from fears.
nothing is left for the years, voices scream.
nothing seems reals a dream.

toys toys toys in the attic.
toys toys toys in the attic.
toys toys toys in the attic.
toys toys toys.

in the attic, lights.
voices scream, nothing seems.
reals a dream.

leaving the things that are real behind.
leaving the things that you love from mind.
all of the things that you learned from fears.
nothing is left for the years, voices scream.
nothing seems reals a dream.

toys toys toys in the attic.
toys toys toys in the attic.
