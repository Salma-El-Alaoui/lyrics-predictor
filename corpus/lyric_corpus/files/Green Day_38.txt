dear mother, can you hear me whining?
its been three whole weeks since i have left your home.
this sudden fear has left me trembling.
cause now it seems i am out here on my own.
and i am feeling so alone.

pay attention to the cracked streets and the broken homes.
some call it slum, some call it nice.
i want to take you through a wasteland i like to call my home.
welcome to paradise.

a gunshot rings out at the station.
another urchin snaps and left dead on his own.
it makes me wonder why i am still here.
for some strange reason its still now feeling like my home.
i am never gonna go.

pay attention to the cracked streets and the broken homes.
some call it slum, some call it nice.
i want to take you through a wasteland i like to call my home.
welcome to paradise.

dear mother, can you hear me laughing?
its been six whole months since i have left your home.
it makes me wonder why i am still here.
for some strange reason its still now feeling like my home.
i am never gonna go.

pay attention to the cracked streets and the broken homes.
some call it slum, some call it nice.
i want to take you through a wasteland i like to call my home.
welcome to paradise.
