make his fight on the hill in the early day.
constant chill deep inside.
shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey.
on they fight, for the right, yes, but whos to say?
for a hill, men would kill, why? they do not know.
stiffened wounds test their pride.
men of five, still alive through the raging glow.
gone insane from the pain that they surely know.

for whom the bell tolls.
time marches on.
for whom the bell tolls.

take a look to the sky just before you die.
it is the last time he will.
blackened roar massive roar fills the crumbling sky.
shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry.
stranger now, are his eyes, to this mystery.
he hears the silence so loud.
crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be.
now they see, what will be, blinded eyes to see.

for whom the bell tolls.
time marches on.
for whom the bell tolls.
