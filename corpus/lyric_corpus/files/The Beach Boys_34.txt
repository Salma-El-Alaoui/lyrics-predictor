i know perfectly well.
i am not where i should be.
i have been very aware.
you have been patient with me.

every time we break up.
you bring back your love to me.
and after all i have done to you.
how can it be.

you still believe in me.

i try hard to be more.
what you want me to be.
but i can not help how i act.
when you are not here with me.

i try hard to be strong.
but sometimes i fail myself.
and after all i have promised you.
so faithfully.

you still believe in me.

i wanna cry....
