what would i do, lonely as you.
pleasure or pain i can not choose.
what would i do, lonely as you.
pleasure or pain i can not choose.
wake up your dreaming, i can not stand your screaming.
drowning out these prayers, just some words without meaning.
spare all the preaching, my secrets worth keeping.
no one understands like i do.
keep out of reach i am your leading deletion.
hide behind these masks though they still see right through them.

chorus.
every now and then, you are down and out my friend.
down and out again x3.
but i am down with you.
one more time for the last time.
one more time for release.
one more time for the last time.
everyone wants to believe.

blame it on youth all these years i have been losing.
blame it on the past its the last place i knew you.
blame all the children, they are raging and ruined.
blame it on the black and the blue.

chorusx2.

one more time for the last time.
one more time for release.
one more time for the last time.
everyone wants to believe.

one more time for the last time.
one more time for release.
one more time for the very last time.
everyone wants to believe alright.
