so limitless and free.
desperately in need of some strangers hand.
in a desperate land.

lost in a roman wilderness of pain.
and all the children are insane.

the killer awoke before dawn, he put his boots on.
he took a face from the ancient gallery.
and he walked on down the hall.
he went into the room where his sister lived and then he.
paid a visit to his brother and then he.
he walked on down the hall and.
and he came to a door.
and he looked inside.

this is the end.
beautiful friend.
this is the end.
my only friend, the end.
it hurts to set you free.
but you will never follow me.
the end of laughter and soft lies.
the end of nights we tried to die.
this is the end.
