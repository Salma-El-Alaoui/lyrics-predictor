it was one of those nights when you turn out the lights.
and everything comes into view.
she was taking her time, i was loosing my mind.
there was nothing that she would not do.

it was not the first, was not the last.
she knew we was making love.
i was so satisfied deep down inside.
like a hand in a velvet glove.

seems like a touch, a touch too much.
seems like a touch, a touch too much.
too much for my body, too much for my brain.
this damn womans gonna drive me insane.
shes got a touch, a touch too much.

she had the face of an angel, smiling with sin.
the body of venus with arms.
dealing with danger, stroking my skin.
like a thunder and lightening storm.

it was not the first, was not the last.
it was not that she did not care.
she wanted it hard, wanted it fast.
she liked it done medium rare.

seems like a touch, a touch too much.
seems like a touch, a touch too much.
too much for my body, too much for my brain.
this damn womans gonna drive me insane.
she has a touch, a touch too much.
