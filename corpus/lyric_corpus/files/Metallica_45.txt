... and the road becomes my bride.
and the road becomes my bride.
i have stripped of all but pride.
so in her i do confide.
and she keeps me satisfied.
gives me all i need.

... and with dust in throat i crave.
only knowledge will i save.
to the game you stay as slave.

rover, wanderer.
nomad, vagabond.
call me what you will    yeah!

no    but i will take my time anywhere.
free to speak my mind anywhere.
and i will redefine anywhere.
anywhere i roam.
where i lay my head is home   yeah!

... and the earth becomes my throne.
and the earth becomes my throne.
i adapt to the unknown.
under wandering stars i have grown.
by myself but not alone.
i ask no one.

and my ties are severed clean.
less i have the more i gain.
off the beaten path i reign.

rover wanderer.
nomad vagabond.
call me what you will    yea will!

but i will take my time anywhere.
i am free to speak my mind anywhere.
and i will never mind anywhere.
anywhere i roam.
where i lay my head is home    yeah yeah!
