young lust.
happy just to be in lust.
never have to eat no dust.

young lust.
you are dying and you are screaming inside.
you are guilty way before you been tried.

easy when theres nothing to lose.
and baby you been missing out.

young lust.
sometimes you need it so bad.
its enough to drive a young girl mad.

a little bit o nasty.
you look a little sleazy.
but do not get any on you.

young lust.

when you are streaking down the alleyway.

checking out the ladies.
who did not bring their boyfriends.
who love to get in trouble.

always getting stronger.
never getting weaker.
my love is getting longer.
i will keep it in my sneaker.
never keep a secret.
never feeling guilty.
never getting lonely.
never getting no peace.
hiding from the police.

sneaking out the back way.
sneaking down the alleyway.
gotta do it my way.

do it in the sunshine.
hanging from the clothesline.
find another tree to climb.

young lust.
