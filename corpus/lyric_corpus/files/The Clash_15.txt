if its true that a rich man leads a sad life.
n thats what they from day to day.
then what do all the poor do with their lives?
have nothing to say on judgment day?

chorus.
i have been beat up, i have been thrown out.
but i am not down, i am not down.
i have been shown up, but i have grown up.
and i am not down, i am not down.

on my own i faced a gang of jeering in strange streets.
when my nerves were pumping and i.
fought my fear in, i did not run.
i was not done.

chorus.

and i have lived that kind of day.
when one of your sorrows will go away.
it goes down and down and hit the floor.
down and down and down some more.
depression.
but i now there will be some way.
when i can swing everything back my way.
like skyscrapers rising up.
floor by floor, i am not giving up.

so you rock around and think that.
you are the toughest.
in the world, the whole wide world.
but you are streets away from where.
it gets the roughest.
you aingt been there.

chorus.
