verse 1.
nothing seems to be the way.
that it used to.
everything seems shallow.
god give me truth.
in me.
and tell me somebody is watching.
over me.
and that is all i am praying is that.

someday i will understand.
in gods whole plan.
and what hes done to me.
oh but maybe.
someday i will breathe.
and i will finally see.
i will see it all in my baby.

verse 2.
do not you run too fast my dear.
why do not you stop?
just stop and listen to your tears.
they are all you have got.
its in you.
you see somebody is watching.
over you.
and that is all i am praying is that.

someday you will understand.
in gods whole plan.
and what he does to you.
oh but maybe.
someday you will breathe.
and you will finally see.
you will see it all in your baby.
you will see it all in your baby.

no moment.
will be more true.
than the moment.
i look at you.

its in you.
you see somebody is watching.
over you.
and that is all i am praying is that.

someday you will understand.
in gods whole plan.
and what he does to you.
oh but maybe.
someday you will breathe.
and you will finally see.
you will see it all in your baby.
you will see it all in your baby.
you will see it all in your baby.
you will see it all in your baby.
