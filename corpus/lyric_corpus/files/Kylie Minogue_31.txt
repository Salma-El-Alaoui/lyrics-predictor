1a.
non stop dancing the bus stop.
to the funky music.
hustle, pumpin the muscle.
blame it on the boogie.

1b.
remember the old days.
remember the ojays.
walking in rhythm, life was for living.

chorus.
when you can not find the music.
to get down and boogie.
all you can do is step back in time.
ball of confusion.
when nothing is new, and.
theres nothing doing, step back in time.

2
keep on trucking along.
riding on a love train.
and then we can float on.
you will never go wrong.

chorus.

step back in time.
step back.
i wanna step back, step back.

1b.
