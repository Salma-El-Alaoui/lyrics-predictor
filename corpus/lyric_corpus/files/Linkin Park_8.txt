crawling in my skin.
these wounds they will not heal.
fear is how i fall.
confusing what is real.

theres something inside me that pulls beneath the surface.
consuming.
confusing.
this lack of self control i fear is never ending.
controlling.
i can not seem.
to find myself again.
my walls are closing in.
without a sense of confidence.
i am convinced that theres just too much pressure to take.
i have felt this way before.
so insecure.

discomfort endlessly has pulled itself upon me.
distracting.
reacting.
against my will i stand beside my own reflection.
its haunting.
how i can not seem.
to find myself again.
my walls are closing in.
without a sense of confidence.

so insecure.
