3 chains o gold.

if i do not think about the fact that she left me.
if i do not see the pearls fall from the sky.
if i do not hear the accusations of blasphemy.
if i do not feel the tears in my eyes.
this is the best day of my life.

u say u will call me and then u do not.
i want 2 kiss u and then i will not.
we both do nothing and call it love.
is this love?
is this love?

this morning i wanted a cup of coffee.
but i did not have any cream.
last night i wanted some inspiration.
but i did not have any dreams.
coupled with the fact that u belong 2 another.
whose name is self righteousness.
so evil girl, if one of us has a date with the undertaker.
which one will it be?
u can cry 4ever, but u will get no sympathy.
this is the best day of my life!

i have got 3 chains of gold.
and they will shine 4ever.
they are the nucleus of my soul.
melt down? no, they will never.
i have got 3 chains of gold.
and they will shine 4ever.
they are the nucleus of my soul.
melt down? no, they will never.

yes give back the chains.
if u do not, u will die.
nothing should come between u and i.

i have got 3 chains of gold.
and they will shine 4ever.
if one of us has 2 go.
u will go before me.
if one of us has 2 go 3 chains of gold.
u will go before me 3 chains of gold.
u will go before me, baby they will shine 4ever.
cuz i shonuff say u will.

3 chains of gold.

i have got 3 chains of gold.

3 chains of gold.
