a heart thats full up like a landfill.
a job that slowly kills you.
bruises that will not heal.

you look so tired unhappy.
bring down the government.
they do not, they do not speak for us.

i will take the quiet life.
a handshake with carbon monoxide.
no alarms and no surprises.
no alarms and no surprises.
no alarms and no surprises.
silent.
silent.

this is my final fit.
my final bellyache with.
no alarms and no surprises.
no alarms and no surprises.
no alarms and no surprises please.

such a pretty house.
and such a pretty garden.
no alarms and no surprises.
no alarms and no surprises.
no alarms and no surprises please.
