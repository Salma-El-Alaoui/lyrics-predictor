where do bad folks go when they die?
they do not go to heaven where the angels fly.
they go to a lake of fire and fry.
see em again till the fourth of july.

i knew a lady who came from duluth.
she got bit by a dog with a rabid tooth.
she went to her grave just a little too soon.
and flew away howling on the yellow moon.

the people cry and the people moan.
they look for a dry place to call their home.
try to find some place to rest their bones.
while the angels and the devils try to make em their own.
