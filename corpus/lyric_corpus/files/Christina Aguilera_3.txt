ooo oo hoo ooo.
ooo yea.

when i think how life used to be.
always walking in the shadows.
then i look at what you have given me.
i feel like dancing on my tip toes.
i must say everyday i wake.
and realize you are by my side.
i know i am truly...

blessed for everything you have given me.
blessed for all the tenderness you show.
do my best with every breath thats in me.
blessed to make sure you never go.

there are times that test your faith.
till you think you might surrender.
baby i am, i am not ashamed to say.
that my hopes were growing slender.
you walked by in the knick of time.
looking like an answered prayer.
you know i am truly...

blessed for everything you have given me.
blessed for all the tenderness you show.
do my best with every breath thats in me.
blessed to make sure you never go.

blessed with love and understanding.
blessed when i hear you call my name.
 i hear you call my name.
i will do my best with faith thats never ending.
blessed to make sure you feel the same.

deep inside of me you fill me with your gentle touch.
i know i am truly...

blessed for everything you have given me.
blessed for all the tenderness you showoh oh.
do my best with every breath thats in me.
blessed to see you never go.
never never never go.
