londons burning! londons burning!

all across the town, all across the night.
everybodys driving with full headlights.
black or white turn it on, face the new religion.
everybodys sitting round watching television!

chorus.
londons burning with boredom now.
londons burning dial 9 9 9 9 9.

i am up and down the westway, in an out the lights.
what a great traffic system   its so bright.
i can not think of a better way to spend the night.
then speeding around underneath the yellow lights.

chorus.

now i am in the subway and i am looking for the flat.
this one leads to this block, this one leads to that.
the wind howls through the empty blocks looking for a home.
i run through the empty stone because i am all alone.

chorus.
