how do i get closer to you.
when you keep it all on mute.
how do i know the right way to love you.
usually the queen at figuring out.
breaking down the man is no workout.
but i have no clue how to get through to you.

i wanna hit you just to see if you cry.
i keep knocking on wood hoping theres a real boy inside.

cause you are not a man you are just a mannequin.
i wish you could feel that my love is real.
but you are not a man.

i wish i could just turn you on.
put a battery in and make you talk.
even pull a string for you to say anything.
but with you there is no guarantee only expired warranty.
a bunch of broken parts but i can not seem to find your heart.

i am such a fool i am such a fool i am such a fool.
this ones outta my hands.
i can not put you back together again.

cause you are not a man you are just a mannequin.
i wish you could feel that my love is real but you are not a man.
you are just a, a toy could you ever be a real, real boy.
and understand but you are not a man.

if the past is the problem our future could solve them baby.
i could bring you to life if you let me inside baby.
it will hurt but in the end you will be a man.

you are not a man you are just a mannequin.
i wish you could feel that my love is real a toy.
could you ever be a real, real boy.
and understand but you are not a man.

you are not a man you are just a mannequin.
i wish you could feel that my love is real but you are not a man.
