this is the place where all the junkies go.
when time gets fast but everything gets slow.
can i get some vaseline.
step into a modern scene.
take a chance on that which seems to be the making of a dream.
i do not wanna do it like my daddy did.
i do not wanna give it to my babys kid.

chorus.
this is my calling.
i said my darling.
shocking appalling.
all i can do to you.
hammers are falling.
i said my darling.
shocking appalling.
all i can do to you.

this is the place where all the devils plead.
their case to take from you what they need.
can i isolate your gene.
can i kiss your dopamine.
in a way i wonder if shes living in a magazine.
i do not wanna say it if it is not so.
i do not wanna weigh it but i gotta know.

chorus.
this is my calling.
i said my darling.
shocking appalling.
all i can do to you.
hammers are falling.
i said my darling.
shocking appalling.
all i can do to you.

i saw you out there yesterday.
what did you wanna say.
a perfect piece of dna.
caught in a flashing ray.
i caught you out there in the fray.
what did you wanna say.
a masterpiece of dna.
caught in a flashing ray.

can i smell your gasoline.
can i pet your wolverine.
on the day my best friend died i could not get my carpet clean.
i do not wanna take it up with little joe.
i do not wanna fake it but i gotta know.

chorus.
this is my calling.
i said my darling.
shocking appalling.
all i can do to you.
hammers are falling.
i said my darling.
shocking appalling.
all i can do to you.

i am a misfit.
i am born with all of it.
the fucking ultimate of love inside the atom split.
i am in a flash ray.
a mash of dna.
another popping jay who thinks hes got something to say.
