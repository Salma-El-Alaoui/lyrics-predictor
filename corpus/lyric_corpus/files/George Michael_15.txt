close friend of mine as a child fell into a slumber.
no sign of life since 75.
then one day he just, what do you know.
i guess god just called his number.

he called me up he called me up and said.
i have been awake about a week.
i am thinking about asking the doctor.
if he could put me back to sleep.
then he laughed and said.
hey all the girls they look the same.
do not they know just what their mothers.
paid in blood, and tears to change.
but the words that made me cry.
the thing he softly said.
it stayed with me, it keeps messing with my head.
he said, if jesus christ is alive and well.
then how come john  elvis are dead?

youth, beautiful youth.
we walked through the walls until we found the truth.
and said change it, its ugly just change it.
everyone we used to know.
must have given up, so long ago.
you can see it, its written on their faces.
and the inside of their clothes.

but the words that made me cry.
cos i knew just what they meant.
he turned to me and said.
hey boy, if jesus christ is alive and well.
then how come john  elvis are dead?

tell me if jesus christ is alive and well.
then how come marvin  elvis are dead?

i said if jesus christ is going to save us from ourselves.
how come peace, love and elvis are dead?
