what do you do when you know somethings bad for you.
and you still can not let go?

i was naive.
your love was like candy.
artificially sweet.
i was deceived by the wrapping.
got caught in your web.
and i learned how to bleed.
i was prey in your bed.
and devoured completely.

and it hurts my soul.
cause i can not let go.
all these walls are caving in.
i can not stop my suffering.
i hate to show that i have lost control.
cause i, i keep going right back.
to the one thing that i need to walk away from.

i need to get away from ya.
i need to walk away from ya.
get away, walk away, walk away.

i should have known.
i was used for amusement.
could not see through the smoke.
it was all an illusion.
now i have been licking my wounds licking my wounds.
but the vemon seeps deeper deeper, deeper.
we both can seduce.
but darling you hold me prisoner prisoner.

i am about to break.
i can not stop this ache.
i am addicted to your allure.
and i am fiending for a cure.
every step i take.
leads to one mistake.
i keep going right back.
to the one thing that i need...

i can not mend.
this torn state i am in.
getting nothing in return.
what did i do to deserve.
the pain of this slow burn.
and everywhere i turn.
i keep going right back.
to the one thing that i need to walk away from.

i need to get away from ya.
i need to walk away from ya.

everytime i try to grasp for air.
i get smothered in dispair, its never over, over.
seems i will never wake from this nightmare.
i let out a silent prayer.
that it be over, over.

inside i am screaming.
begging pleading no more.

i do not know what to do.
my heart has been bruised.
so sad but its true.
each beat reminds me of you.

it hurts my soul.
cause i can not let go.
all these walls are caving in.
i can not stop my suffering.
i hate to show that i have lost control.
cause i.
i keep going right back.
to the one thing that i need, oh.

i am about to break.
and i can not stop this ache.
i am addicted to your allure.
and i am fiending for a cure.
every step i take.
leads to one mistake.
i keep going right back.
to the one thing that i need, oh.

i can not mend.
this torn state i am in.
getting nothing in return.
what did i do to deserve.
the pain of this slow burn.
and everywhere i turn.
i keep going right back.
to the one thing that i need to walk away from.

i say...
i need to get away from ya.
i need to walk away from ya.
get away, walk away, walk away.

only thing i need to do is walk away.

i need to get away from ya.
i need to walk away from ya.
get away, walk away, walk away.

i need to get away from ya.
i need to walk away from ya.
get away, walk away, walk away.

i need to get away from ya.
i need to walk away from ya.
get away, walk away, walk away.
