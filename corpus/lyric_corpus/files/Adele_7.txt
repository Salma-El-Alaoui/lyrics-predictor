when the rain is blowing in your face.
and the whole world is on your case .
i could offer you a warm embrace .
to make you feel my love.
 
when the evening shadows and the stars appear.
and there is no one there to dry your tears.
i could hold you for a million years .
to make you feel my love.
 
i know, you have made your mind up yet .
but i would never do you wrong.
i have known it from the moment that we met.
no doubt in my mind where you belong.
 
id go hungry.
id go black and blue.
id go crawling down the avenue.
no.
theres nothing that i would not do .
to make you feel my love.
 
the storms are raging on the rolling sea .
and on the highway of regret.
the winds of change are blowing wild and free.
you aingt seen nothing like me yet.
 
i could make you happy.
make your dreams come true.
nothing that i would not do.
go to the ends of the earth for you .
to make you feel my love.
to make you feel my love.
