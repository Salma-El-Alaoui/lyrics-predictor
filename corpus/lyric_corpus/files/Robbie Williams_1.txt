theres no earthly way of knowing.
what was in your heart.
when it stopped going.
the whole world shook.
a storm was blowing through you.

waiting for god to stop this.
and up to your neck in darkness.
everyone around you was corrupted.
saying something.

theres no dignity in death.
to sell the world your last breath.
they are still fighting over.
everything you left over.

i saw you standing at the gates.
when marlon brando passed away.
you had that look upon your face.
advertising space.

and.
no one learned from your mistakes.
we let our profit s go to waste.
all thats left in any case.
is advertising space.

through your eyes.
the world was burning.
please be gentle.
i am still learning.
you seemed to say.
as you kept turning up.

they poisoned you with compromise.
at what point did you realise.
everybody loves your lies.
but you ahahh.

special agent for the man.
through watergate and vietnam.
no one really gave a damn.
did you think the cia did.
