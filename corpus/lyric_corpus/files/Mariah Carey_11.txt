chorus.
you have got me feeling emotions.
deeper than i have ever dreamed of.
you have got me feeling emotions.
higher than the heavens above.

i feel good.
i feel nice.
i have never felt so.
satisfied.
i am in love.
i am alive.
intoxicated.
flying high.
it feel like a dream.
when you touch me tenderly.
i do not know if its real.
but i like the way i feel.
inside.

chorus.

in the morning.
when i rise.
you are the first thing.
on my mind.
and in the middle.
of the night.
i feel your heartbeat.
next to mine.
it feels like a dream.
when you love me tenderly.
i do not know if you are for real.
but i like the way i feel.
inside.

chorus.

you know the way to make me.
lose control.
when you are looking into my eyes.
you make me feel so.
high.

chorus.
