good and bad, i swear i have had the both they are overrated.
but is not it fun, when you get hold of one.
some go bad and some come back, the good ones all get taken.
i am calling a bluff, you aingt strong enough.

wait and pray you will pick on me.
the day i raise my hand.
guess that i have been blessed, but i will be damned.

halo.
god only knows.
right behind me everywhere i go.

halo.
god only knows.
right behind me everywhere i go.

say your prayers when you get scared.
pray you are gonna make it.
and then we are done, you keep fucking up.
one day soon i will disappear and if you will come i will take you.
somewhere go, to keep from growing old.

wait and pray you will pick on me.
the day i raise my hand.
guess that i have been blessed, but i will be damned.

halo.
god only knows.
right behind me everywhere i go.

halo.
god only knows.
right behind me everywhere i go.

oh......
oh......
oh......

disappear the light is fading.
disappear outside their rage.
disappear i am tired of waiting.
disappear before we fade away.

halo.
god only knows.
right behind me everywhere i go.

halo.
god only knows.
right behind me everywhere i go.
