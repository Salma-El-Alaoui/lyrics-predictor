fortune, fame mirror vain gone insane.
but the memory remains.

heavy rings on fingers wave.
another star denies the grave.
see the nowhere crowd cry the nowhere tears of honor.
like twisted vines that grow.
that hide and swallow mansions whole.
and dim the light of an already faded prima donna.

fortune, fame mirror vain gone insane.
fortune, fame mirror vain gone insane.
but the memory remains.

heavy rings hold cigarettes.
up to lips that time forgets.
while the hollywood sun sets behind your back.
and can not the band play on?
just listen, they play my song.
ash to ash, dust to dust, fade to black.

fortune, fame mirror vain gone insane.
fortune, fame mirror vain gone insane.
dance little tin goddess.

na na na na....

drift away, fade away, little tin goddess.
ash to ash, dust to dust, fade to black.

fortune, fame mirror vain gone insane.
fortune, fame mirror vain gone insane.
but the memory remains.

ash to ash, dust to dust, fade to black.
but the memory remains.

yeah.
faded prima donna, yeah, yeah.

dance little tin goddess, dance.

na na na na....
