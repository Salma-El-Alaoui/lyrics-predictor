sky was blue and high above.
the moon was new and so was love.
this eager heart of mine was singing.
lover, where can you be.
it came at last love had its day.
the day is past, you have gone away.
this eager heart of mine is singing.
lover, come to me.
i remember every little thing you used to do.
i i am lonely.
every road i walk along.
i have walked along with you.
no wonder i am lonely.
the sky is blue, the night is cold.
the moon is new, but love is old.
and while i am waiting here.
this heart of mine is singing.
lover, come to me.
when i remember every little thing you used to do.
huh huh...i am lonely.
every road i walk along.
i have walked along with you.
no wonder i am lonely.
the sky is blue, the night is cold.
the moon is new, but love is old.
and while i am standing here.
this heart of mine is singing.
lover, lover, get here to me...
now!!!
