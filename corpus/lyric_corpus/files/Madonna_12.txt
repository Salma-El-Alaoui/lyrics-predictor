spoken.
come on girls.
do you believe in love?
cause i got something to say about it.
and it goes something like this.

chorus.

do not go for second best baby.
put your love to the test.
you know, you know, you have got to.
make him express how he feels.
and maybe then you will know your love is real.

you do not need diamond rings.
or eighteen karat gold.
fancy cars that go very fast.
you know they never last, no, no.
what you need is a big strong hand.
to lift you to your higher ground.
make you feel like a queen on a throne.
make him love you till you can not come down.
you will never come down.

chorus.

long stem roses are the way to your heart.
but he needs to start with your head.
satin sheets are very romantic.
what happens when you are not in bed.
you deserve the best in life.
so if the time is not right then move on.
second best is never enough.
you will do much better baby on your own.
baby on your own.

chorus.

express yourself.
you have got to make him.
express himself.
hey, hey, hey, hey.
so if you want it right now, make him show you how.
express what hes got, oh baby ready or not.

intermediate.

and when you are gone he might regret it.
think about the love he once had.
try to carry on, but he just will not get it.
he will be back on his knees.

to express himself.
you have got to make him.
express himself.
hey hey.

what you need is a big strong hand.
to lift you to your higher ground.
make you feel like a queen on a throne.
make him love you till you can not come down.
you will never come down.

intermediate.

chorus.

express yourself.
you have got to make him.

so if you want it right now, make him show you how.

so you can respect yourself.
hey, hey.
so if you want it right now, then make him show you how.
express what hes got, oh baby ready or not.
