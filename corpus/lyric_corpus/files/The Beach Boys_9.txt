its automatic when i.
talk with old friends.
the conversation turns to.
girls we knew when their.
hair was soft and long and the.
beach was the place to go.

suntanned bodies and.
waves of sunshine the.
california girls and a.
beautiful coastline.
warmed up weather.
let us get together and.
do it again.

with a girl the lonely sea looks good with moonlight.
makes your nighttimes warm and out of sight.

been so long.
hey now hey now hey now hey now hey now.
hey now hey now hey now hey now hey now.

well i have been thinking bout.
all the places we have surfed and danced and.
all the faces we have missed so let us get.
back together and do it again.

ow!
