i got dosed by you and.
closer than most to you and.
what am i sposed to do.
take it away i never had it anyway.
take it away and everything will be okay.

in you a star is born and.
you cut a perfect form and.
someone forever warm.
lay on lay on lay on lay on.
lay on lay on lay on lay on.

way up on the mountain where she died.
all i ever wanted was your life.
deep inside the canyon i can not hide.
all i ever wanted was your life.

show love with no remorse and.
climb onto your sea horse and.
this ride is right on course.
this is the way i wanted it to be with you.
this is the way i knew that it would be with you.
lay on lay on lay on lay on.
lay on lay on lay on lay on.

way up on the mountain where she died.
all i ever wanted was your life.
deep inside the canyon i can not hide.
all i ever wanted was your life.
