oh little jeannie.
you got so much love.
little jeannie.
and you take it where it strikes.
and give it to the likes of me.

she got so much love.
little jeannie.
so i see you when i can.
you make me all a man can be.

and i want you to be my acrobat.
i want you to be my lover.
oh there were others who would treat you cruel.
and oh little jeannie.
you were always someones fool.

little jeannie.
you got so much time.
little jeannie.
though you have grown beyond your years.
you still retain the fears of youth.

oh little jeannie.
you got so much time.
little jeannie.
but you are burning it up so fast.
searching for some lasting truth.

and i want you to be my acrobat.
i want you to be my lover.
oh there were others who would treat you cruel.
but oh jeannie.
i will always be your fool.
