you can not keep holding it in when its something good.

hey, this will not take much time.
we will not touch, we will just wait for signs.
and nothing was further from my mind.
than this moment with you.

but if youd only told me baby.
i would have made some other plans.
if id only seen it sooner.
but what a way with your hands you had.
i wanted that moment with you.

i know that is wrong.
but if you need me, i am here, turns me on.
i can not help thinking its a miracle you are here.
i can not help thinking its a miracle.

say, do not waste much time.
we do not touch, do we baby?
but still my hands are tied.
for that moment with you.

but if youd only told me baby.
i would have made some other plans.
if id only seen it sooner.
but what a way with your hands you had.
i wanted that moment with you.

you know that i am strong.
and i have no reason to fear, am i wrong?
i can not help thinking its a miracle you are here.
i can not help thinking its a miracle.
i can not help thinking its a american.
i can not help thinking its a miracle.
i can not help thinking its a miracle you are here.

you can not keep holding it in when its something good.
get up, get up.
you can not keep holding it in when its something good.
get up, get up.

and who can you trust? dealing out justice.
with a minimum of fuss.
who baby?
dealing out justice....
