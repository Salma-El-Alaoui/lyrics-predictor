look at the red, red changes in the sky.
look at the separation in the borderline.
do not look here inside.
but do not look at everything here inside.
here inside.
and do not be afraid, afraid to speak your mind.

it took a moment before i lost myself in here.
it took a moment and i could not be found.
again and again and again and again.
i see your face in everything.
it took a moment, the moment it could not be found.

whats with the fascination with the echelon?
whats with the constant questions that you have this time?
whats with this circumstantial consequence?
consequence.
find oversight before this night will ever rise again.

its all you have got inside your head.
better get up and leave instead.

it took a moment before i lost myself in here.
it took a moment and i could not be found.
again and again and again and again.
i see your face in everything.
it took a moment, the moment it could not be found.

to find ourselves lost here within we need the reasons why.
so we take this bridge with the others that will thrive in the great divide.

look at the red, red changes in the sky.

again and again and again and again.
i see your face in everything.
again and again and again and again.
i see your face in everything.

it took a moment before i lost myself in here.
it took a moment and i could not be found.
again and again and again and again.
i see your face in everything.
it took a moment, the moment it could not be found.
