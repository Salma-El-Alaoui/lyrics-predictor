angie, angie.
when will those clouds all disappear?
angie, angie.
where will it lead us from here?

with no loving in our souls.
and no money in our coats.
you can not say we are satisfied.
but angie, angie.
you can not say we never tried.

angie, you are beautiful, yeah.
but aingt it time we said goodbye?
angie, i still love you.
remember all those nights we cried?

all the dreams we held so close.
seemed to all go up in smoke.
let me whisper in your ear.
angie, angie.
where will it lead us from here?

oh, angie, do not you weep.
all your kisses still taste sweet.
i hate that sadness in your eyes.
but angie, angie.
aingt it time we said goodbye?

with no loving in our souls.
and no money in our coats.
you can not say we are satisfied.
but angie, i still love you, baby.
evrywhere i look i see your eyes.
there aingt a woman that comes close to you.
come on baby, dry your eyes.

but angie, angie.
aingt it good to be alive?
angie, angie.
they can not say we never tried.
