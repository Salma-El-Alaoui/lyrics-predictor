i close both locks below the window.
i close both blinds and turn away.
sometimes solutions are not so simple.
sometimes goodbyes the only way.

and the sun will set for you.
the sun will set for you.
and the shadow of the day.
will embrace the world in grey.
and the sun will set for you.

in cards and flowers on your window.
your friends all plead for you to stay.
sometimes beginnings are not so simple.
sometimes goodbyes the only way.

and the sun will set for you.
the sun will set for you.
and the shadow of the day.
will embrace the world in grey.
and the sun will set for you.

and the shadow after day.
will embrace the world in grey.
and the sun will set for you.

and the shadow of the day.
will embrace the world in grey.
and the sun will set for you.
