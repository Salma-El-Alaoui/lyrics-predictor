i have been around the world.
i have seen a million girls.
aingt one of them got.
what my lady shes got.
she steals the spotlight.
knocks me off my feet.
shes enough to start a landslide.
just a walkin down the street.
wearing dresses so tight.
and looking dynamite.
enough to blow me out.
no doubt about it can not live without it.

chorus.
the girls got rhythm girls got rhythm.
the girls got rhythm girls got rhythm.
shes got the backseat rhythm backseat rhythm.
the girls got rhythm.

shes like a lethal brand.
too much for any man.
she gives me first degree.
she really satisfies me.
love me till i am legless.
aching and sore.
enough to stop a freight train.
or start the third world war.
you know i am losin sleep.
i am in too deep.
like a body needs blood.
no doubt about it can not live without it.

chorus.

you know she moves like sin.
and when she lets me in.
its like liquid love.
no doubt about it can not live without it.

the girls got rhythm girls got rhythm.
the girls got rhythm girls got rhythm.
shes got the backseat rhythm backseat rhythm.
the girls got rhythm girls got rhythm.
you know she really got the rhythm girls got rhythm.
shes got the backseat rhythm backseat rhythm.
rock n roll rhythm rock n roll rhythm.
the girls got rhythm.
