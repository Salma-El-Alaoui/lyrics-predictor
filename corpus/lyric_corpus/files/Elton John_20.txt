i can see very well.
theres a boat on the reef with a broken back.
and i can see it very well.
theres a joke and i know it very well.
its one of those that i told you long ago.
take my word i am a madman do not you know.

once a fool had a good part in the play.
if its so would i still be here today?
its quite peculiar in a funny sort of way.
they think its very funny everything i say.
get a load of him, hes so insane.
youd better get your coat dear.
it looks like rain.

we will come again next thursday afternoon.
the inlaws hope they will see you very soon.
but is it in your conscience that you are after.
another glimpse of the madman across the water.

the grounds a long way down but i need more.
is the nightmare black.
or are the windows painted?
will they come again next week.
can my mind really take it?
