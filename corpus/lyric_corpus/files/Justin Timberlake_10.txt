i was just walking that day aimlessly.
you picked the perfect day to bump into me perfect day.
probably should have watched the stars in the sky the night before.
but for some reason.
we still met at your store.
you baby.
and your eyes have a story.
that they wish to tell.
and i have my whole life and i listen well.
hey.
look i will be your confidante.
tell me anything.
but please start it off with how you tuck your wings.

theres nothing else that i have seen.
theres no getting around it or in between.
you are out of this world.
except you are not green look.
you do not know what you mean to me.
to me.

all my friends meet you and say you are the one.
you are the one you are the one.
and all my meaningless friendships should be done.
i should just leave them alone.
baby hey hey.
you had a friend but he did you wrong.
but i am a god sent sign that reads.
please move on with me.

you taught me to use my heart and forget my eyes.
use my heart forget my eyes.
and thats the way to his kingdom to eternal life.
since you are an angel baby your jobs never done.
too bad the world will not see you when they dial 911.
thats why.

theres nothing else that i have seen.
theres no getting around it or in between.
you are out of this world.
except you are not green look.
you dont know what you mean to me.
to me.

theres nothing else that i have seen.
theres no getting around it or in between.
you are out of this world.
except you are not green look.
you dont know what you mean to me.
to me.

theres nothing else in this world.
like you.
yeah.
so why is it so complicated.
what are you afraid of.

i have been asking everybody what they think.
but i dont know why because they do not know you.
i am even askin other guys what would they say.
i do not know why cos they do not know what i do.
girls say an ultimatums the thing.
but youd probably take that and just run.
now i gotta decide if i ama help raise your mind.
seems like the ultimatums on me, thats no fun.
