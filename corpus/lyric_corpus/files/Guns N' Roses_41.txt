i tried so hard just to get through to you.
but your heads so far.
from the realness of truth.
was it just a come on in the dark.
was not meant to last long.
i think you have worn your welcome honey.
i will just see you along as i sing you this song.

time can pass slowly.
things always change.
you days been numbered.
and i have read your last page.
you was just a temporary lover.
honey you aingt the first.
lots of others came before you woman.
said but you been the worst.
sa you been the worst.

so goodbye to you girl.
so long, farewell.
i can not hear you crying.
your jivings been hell.
so look for me walking.
down your street at night.
i will be in with another.
deep down inside.
deep down inside.
