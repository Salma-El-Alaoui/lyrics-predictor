please allow me to introduce myself.
i am a man of wealth and taste.
i have been around for a long, long year.
stole many a mans soul and faith.

and i was round when jesus christ.
had his moment of doubt and pain.
made damn sure that pilate.
washed his hands and sealed his fate.
pleased to meet you.
hope you guess my name.
but whats puzzling you.
is the nature of my game.

i stuck around st. petersberg.
when i saw it was a time for a change.
killed the czar and his ministers.
anastasia screamed in vain.

i rode a tank.
held a generals rank.
when the blitzkrieg raged.
and the bodies stank.

pleased to meet you.
hope you guess my name, oh yeah.
whats puzzling you.
is the nature of my game, oh yeah.

i watched with glee.
while your kings and queens.
fought for ten decades.
for the gods they made.

i shouted out.
who killed the kennedys?
when after all.
it was you and me.

i am a man of wealth and taste.
and i laid traps for troubadors.
who could kill me in vain.
