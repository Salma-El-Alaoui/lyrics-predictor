i watch how the moon sits in the sky on a dark night.
shining with the light from the sun.
but the sun does not give life to the moon.
assuming the moons going to owe it one.
it makes me think of how you act to me.
you do favors and then rapidly.
you just turn around and start asking me.
about things that you want back from me.
i am sick of the tension, sick of the hunger.
sick of you acting like i owe you this.
find another place to feed your greed.
 while i find a place to rest .

i want to be in another place.
i hate when you say you do not understand.
you will see its not meant to be.
i want to be in the energy, not with the enemy.
a place for my head.

maybe someday i will be just like you and.
step on people like you do.
and run away all the people i thought i knew.
i remember back then who you were.
you used to be calm, used to be strong.
used to be generous, but you should have known.
that youd wear out your welcome.
and now you see how quiet it is, all alone.

2x.
i am so sick of the tension ahh.
sick of the hunger lalalalala.
sick of you acting like i owe you this lalalalala.
find another place, to feed your greed.
 while, i find a place to rest .

i want to be in another place.
i hate when you say you do not understand.
you will see its not meant to be.
i want to be in the energy, not with the enemy.
a place for my head.
