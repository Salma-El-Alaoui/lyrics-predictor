i like pleasure spiked with pain.
and music is my aeroplane.
its my aeroplane.
songbird sweet and sour jane.
and music is my aeroplane.
its my aeroplane.

pleasure spiked with pain.
that motherfuckers always spiked with pain.

looking in my own eyes hell o.
i can not find the love i want.
someone better slap me.
before i start to rust.
before i start to decompose.
looking in my rear view mirror.
looking in my rear view mirror.
i can make it disappear.
i can make it disappear! have no fear!

sitting in my kitchen hey girl.
i am turning into dust again.
my melancholy baby.
the star of mazzy must.
push her voice inside of me.
i am overcoming gravity.
i am overcoming gravity.
its easy when you are sad to be.
its easy when you are sad... sad like me!

just one note.
could make me float.
could make me float away.
one note from.
the song she wrote.
could fuck me where i lay.
just one note.
could make me choke.
one note thats not a lie.
just one note.
could cut my throat.
one note could make me die.
