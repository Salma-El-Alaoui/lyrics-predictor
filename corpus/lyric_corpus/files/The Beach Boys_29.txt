well i walked up to her and i asked her if she wanted to dance.
she looked awful nice and so i hoped she might take a chance.

when we danced i held her tight.
then i walked her home that night.
and all the stars were shining bright.
and then i kissed her.

each time i saw her i could not wait to see her again.
i wanted to let her know that i was more than a friend.

i did not know just what to do.
and so i whispered i love you.
and she said that she loved me too.
and then i kissed her.

i kissed her in a way that id never kissed a girl before.
i kissed her in a way that i hope she liked for evermore.

i knew that she was mine so i gave her all the love that i had.
then one day she will take me home to meet her mom and her dad.

then i asked her to be my bride.
and always be right by my side.
i felt so happy that i almost cried.
and then i kissed her.

and then i kissed her.
and then i kissed her.
