...nation to nation all the world must come together.
face the problems that we see then maybe somehow we can work it out.
i asked my neighbour for a favor she said later.
what has come of all the people have we lost love of what its about.
i have to find my peace cause no one seems to let me be.
fal prophets cry of doom what are the possibilities.
i told my brother there will be problem time and tears for fears.
we must leave each day like is today.

go with it go with it.

the world keeps changing rearranging minds and thoughts.
predictions fly of doom the baby boom has come of age we will work it out.
i told my brothers do not you ask me for no favors.
i am conditioned by the system do not ya talk to me or scream and shout.
she prays to god to buddha then she sings a talmud song.
confusions contradict the self do we know right from wrong.
i just want you to recognize me in the temple.
you can not hurt me i found peace within myself.

the big boy stands moving up a hand.
making funky tracks with my man michael jackson.
smooth criminal that the man is mike so relaxed.
jingle mingle jingle in the jungle.
bum rushed the door three and fours in a bundle.
