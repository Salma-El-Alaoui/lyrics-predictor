cop this.
i am hot, and when i am not.
i am cold as ice.
get out of my way.
just step aside.
or pay the price.

what i want i take.
what i do not i break.
and i do not want you.
with a flick of my knife.
i can change your life.
theres nothing you can do.

i am a problem child.
i am a problem child, yes i am.
i am a problem child.
and i am wild.

make my stand.
no mans land.
on my own.
man in blue.
its up to you.
the seed is sown.

what i want i stash.
what i do not i smash.
and you are on my list.
dead or alive.
i got a .45.
and i never miss.

i am a problem child, hey.
i am a problem child.
i am a problem child.
just running wild.

solo.

just watch your step.

every night.
street light.
i drink my booze.
some run.
some fight.
but i win they lose.
what i need i like.
what i do not i fight.
and i do not like you.
say bye bye.
while you are still alive.
your time is through.

cause i am a problem child.
i am a problem child.
i am a problem child.
i am a problem child.
problem child.
i am a problem child.
even my mother hates me.
i am a problem child.
i am a problem child.
problem child, problem child.
problem child, problem child, ....
problem child, problem child.
problem child, problem child.
problem child.
i am a problem child.
problem child.
and i am running wild.
i am a problem child.
problem child, problem child....
