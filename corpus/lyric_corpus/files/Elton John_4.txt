theres a calm surrender to the rush of day.
when the heat of a rolling wind can be turned away.
an enchanted moment, and it sees me through.
its enough for this restless warrior just to be with you.

and can you feel the love tonight.
it is where we are.
its enough for this wide eyed wanderer.
that we got this far.
and can you feel the love tonight.
how its laid to rest.
its enough to make kings and vagabonds.
believe the very best.

theres a time for everyone if they only learn.
that the twisting kaleidoscope moves us all in turn.
theres a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors.
when the heart of this star crossed voyager beats in time with yours.

and can you feel the love tonight.
it is where we are.
its enough for this wide eyed wanderer.
that we got this far.
and can you feel the love tonight.
how its laid to rest.
its enough to make kings and vagabonds.
believe the very best.
