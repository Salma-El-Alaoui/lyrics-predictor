you are such a flirt i know you hurt.
and so do i i empathise.
i see you out you never care.
a conversation that we never share.

but its so strange its something new.
amazing feelings that i have for you.
i close my eyes when i am alone.
wonder what itd be like to make you moan.

i wanna give you something better.
than anything you have ever had.
a stronger and a faster lover.
the world will disappear so fast.

chorus.
sweet kiwi.
your juices dripping down my chin.
so please let me.
do not stop it before it begins.

so give it up and do not pretend.
and spread your arms and legs across the bed.
and when you shake you will not regret.
the things i whisper in your ear.
what?
i said.

i wanna give you something better.
you wanna give me something better.
than anything you have ever had.
than anything i have ever had.
a stronger and a faster lover.
a stronger and a faster lover.
the world will disappear so fast.
will disappear so fast.

chorus.
sweet kiwi.
your juices dripping down my chin.
so please let me.
do not stop it before it begins.

i can not wait to take you home.
fingers through your hair.
kisses on your back.
and scratch me with your nails.

save me from myself.
show me how to care.
get everything out.
dripping everywhere.

lipstick smeared all over your face.
how much longer must we wait?

do not think that i can wait.

chorus.
sweet kiwi.
your juices dripping down my chin.
so please, let me.
do not stop it before it begins.

chorus.
sweet kiwi.
wanna give you something better than this.
your juices dripping down my chin.
hey, yeh.
so please let me.
wanna give you something better than this.
do not stop it before it begins.

do not stop it before it begins.
do not stop it before it begins.
do not stop it before it begins.
do not stop it before it begins.
