do not worry, i will not hurt u.
i only want you 2 have some fun.

i was dreaming when i wrote this.
forgive me if it goes astray.
but when i woke up this morning.
could have sworn it was judgment day.

the sky was all purple.
there were people running everywhere.
trying to run from the destruction.
you know i did not even care.

they say two thousand zero, zero, party over.
oops, out of time!
so tonight i am gonna party like its 1999!

i was dreaming when i wrote this.
so sue me if i go too fast.
but life is just a party.
and parties were not meant to last.

war is all around us.
my mind says prepare to fight.
so if i gotta die.
i am gonna listen to my body tonight.

they say two thousand zero, zero, party over.
oops, out of time!
so tonight i am gonna party like its 1999!
1999!

if you did not come to party.
do not bother knocking on my door.
i got a lion in my pocket.
and baby, hes ready to roar.

yeah, everybodys got a bomb.
we could all die any day.
but before i will let that happen.
i will dance my life away.

they say two thousand zero, zero, party over.
oops, out of time!
we are running outta time.
so tonight we are gonna party like its 1999!

say, say.
two thousand zero, zero, party over.
oops, out of time!
so tonight we are gonna party like its 1999!
