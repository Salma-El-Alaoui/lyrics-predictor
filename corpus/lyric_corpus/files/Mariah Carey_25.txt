1st verse.
by the time you get this message.
its gonna be too late.
so do not bother paging me.
cause i will be on my way.
see i grabbed all my diamonds and clothes.
just ask your momma she knows.
you are gonna miss me baby.
hate to say i told you so.
well at first i did not know.
but now its clear to me.

and lie compulsively.

jumped in your ride and took off.
you will never ever find a girl.
who loves you more than me.
