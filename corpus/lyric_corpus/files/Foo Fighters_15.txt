hello, i have waited here for you.
everlong.
tonight, i have thrown myself into.
and out of the red, out of her head she sang.

come down and waste away with me.
down with me.
slow how you wanted it to be.
i am over my head, out of her head she sang.

and i wonder.
when i sing along with you.
if everything could ever feel this real forever.
if anything could ever be this good again.
the only thing i will ever ask of you.
you got to promise not to stop when i say when.
she sang.

breathe out so i can breathe you in.
hold you in.
and now i know you have always been.
out of your head, out of my head i sang.

and i wonder.
when i sing along with you.
if everything could ever feel this real forever.
if anything could ever be this good again.
the only thing i will ever ask of you.
you got to promise not to stop when i say when.
she sang.

and i wonder.
if everything could ever feel this real forever.
if anything could ever be this good again.
the only thing i will ever ask of you.
you got to promise not to stop when i say when.
