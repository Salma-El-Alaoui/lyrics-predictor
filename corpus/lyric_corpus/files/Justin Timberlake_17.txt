hey girl, is he everything you wanted in a man?
you know i gave you the world.
you had me in the palm of your hand.
so, why your love went away?
i just can not seem to understand.
thought it was me and you, baby.
me and you until the end.
but i guess i was wrong.

do not wanna think about it.
do not wanna talk about it.
i am just so sick about it.
ca not believe its ending this way.
just so confused about it.
feeling abused about it.
i just can not do without you.
so, tell me is this fair?

is this the way its really going down?
is this how we say goodbye?
should have known better when you came around.
that you were gonna make me cry.
its breaking my heart to watch you run around.
cause i know that you are living a lie.
but, thats okay, baby, cause in time you will find.

what goes around, goes around, goes around.
comes all the way back around.

yeah.

now, girl, i remember everything that you claimed.
you said that you were moving on now, and maybe i should do the same.
the funny thing about that is i was ready to give you my name.
thought it was me and you, baby.
and, now, its all just a shame and i guess i was wrong.

do not wanna think about it.
do not wanna talk about it.
i am just so sick about it.
ca not believe its ending this way.
just so confused about it.
feeling abused about it.
i just can not do without you.
can you tell me is this fair?

is this the way its really going down?
is this how we say goodbye?
should have known better when you came around.
that you were gonna make me cry.
and, now, its breaking my heart to watch you run around.
cause i know that you are living a lie.
but, thats okay, baby, cause in time you will find.

what goes around, goes around, goes around.
comes all the way back around.

yeah.

what goes around comes around, yeah.
what goes around comes around, you should know that.

let me paint this picture for you, baby.

you spend your nights alone and he never comes home.
and every time you call him, all you gets a busy tone.
i heard you found out that hes doing to you what you did to me.
aingt that the way it goes?
when you cheated, girl, my heart bleeded girl.
so, that goes without saying that you left me feeling hurt.
just a classic case, scenario.
tale as old as time.
girl, you got what you deserve.

and, now, you want somebody to cure the lonely nights.
you wish you had somebody that could come and make it right.
but, girl, i aingt somebody.
i am out of sympathy.
see, see...

what goes around comes back around.
i thought i told you.
hey.

see.
you should have listened to me, baby.

because.
what goes around comes back around.
