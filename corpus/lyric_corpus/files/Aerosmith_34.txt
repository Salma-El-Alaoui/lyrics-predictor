rag doll, living in a movie.
hot tramp, daddys little cutie.
you are so fine, they will never see ya leaving by the back door, man.
hot time, get it while its easy.
do not mind, come on up and see me.
rag doll, baby will not you do me.
like you done before.

i am feeling like a bad boy.
mmm, just like a bad boy.
i am ripping up a rag doll.
like throwing away an old toy.

some babes talking real loud.
talking all about the new crowd.
try and sell me on an old dream.
a new version of the old scene.

speak easy on the grapevine.
keep shuffling in the shoe shine.
old tin lizzie, do it till you are dizzy.
give it all ya got until you are put out of your misery.

yes i am moving, yes i am moving.
get ready for the big time.
tap dancing on a land mine.

yes i am moving, yes i am moving.
old tin lizzie, do it till you are dizzy.
give it all ya got until you are put out of your misery.

get crazy on the moonshine.

yes i am moving, i am really moving.
sloe gin fizzy, do it till you are dizzy.
give it all you got until you are put out of your misery.
