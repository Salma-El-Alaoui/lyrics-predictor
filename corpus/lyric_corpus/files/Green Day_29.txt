what the next man thinks of me.

and i will sculpt my life for your acceptance.

and i feel forgotten.
feel like rotting.
do you feel the same?
do you feel the same?
adolescence.
just can not make sense.
its calling my name.
its calling my name.

i take a look around.
and all the things i have found.
i call it blind hatred.
if youd stop a while.
and maybe if youd smile.
you would realize that.
we are all the same.

its just like our brain.
when it apes insane.
we feel the same pain.

all my life i have seemed to have this need.
i think at times it even turns to greed.
we all want to join some family.
we will even sacrifice a moral changing.
