i never found out why you left him.
but this answer begs that question.
too blind to see tomorrow, too broke.
to beg or borrow.
young and stupid.
left wide open, hearts are wasted.
lives are broken.

one more point of contention.
i need some intervention.
approached with vague intentions.
betray my short attention span.
the distance bridge the border, beg forgiveness, round the corner.

everytime i look for you   the sun goes down.

and i stumble when this whole thing runs aground.
i left another message.
you are never around.
but everytime i look for you   the sun goes down.
once more.
will the last one out, please shut the door.

more time apart will give you.
a few more months to argue.
is this to much to live through.
it always seemed too far to drive.
the point home, send more letters, pray tomorrow   ends up better.

everytime i look for you   the sun goes down.

i never did do anything that she asked.
i never let what happend, stay in the past.
i never did quite understand what she meant.
in spite of everything, in spite of everything..

everytime i look for you   the sun goes down.

and i stumble when this whole thing runs aground.
i left another message.
you are never around.
