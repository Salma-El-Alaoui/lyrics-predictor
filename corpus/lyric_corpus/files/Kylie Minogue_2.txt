do not blame me just because i am bored.
i am needy i need to taste it all.
do not down me just because i am quiet.
i am thinking about it all.
i am helpless about the way of me.
and i am thinking.
thinking about it all.
i am sorting everything inside.

i am looking into space.
this time this void.
i am making my way through the muddy minutes.
the pull is in my muscle.
the ache is in my bones.
its hard to be alone.

breathe, breathe.
it will not be long now x3.

breathe, breathe.

see through me when i put up a fight.
id like you to see the things i hide.
go deeper than i will let you know.
i am frightened but i will not let it show.
i am helpless about the way of me.
and i am thinking.
thinking about it all.
i am sorting everything inside.

i am looking into space.
this time this void.
i am making my way through the muddy minutes.
the pull is in my muscle.
the ache is in my bones.
and its hard to be alone.

breathe, breathe.
it will not be long now x3.

breathe, breathe.

breathe, breathe.

it will not be long now x12 to fade out.
