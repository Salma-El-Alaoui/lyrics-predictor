here comes the wise man.
and there goes the fool.
you see that burnt out world that he is living in.
i do not need to look for the rules.

here comes the donkey.
chained to a ten ton plough.
he will never make that hill in a million years.
whip crack beating down.

he loves his brother but hed sell him for a fistful of gold.
he needs a slave for his vision of the promised land.
no i do not believe a word.

take me any way the wind blows.
you will never know just what you want to do.
or where you wanna go i think its time.
that you found what the world is waiting for.
i think its time to get real.

anytime you want it then its there.
all you gotta do is stop it.
on the corner and ask.
say hey you do not live today.
stop the world.
stop the world.
i am getting off.

i am getting off.

ca not get enough.
i am getting off.
