sometimes i think of all the places where i do not.

wanna go.

then i think of all the things that i do not wanna do.

and when i think of all the people that i do not wanna.

meet.

i close my eyes and go to sleep.



tully, baby, you are trapped behind your golden bars.

i am the prince of poverty hanging out in bars.

your lifes a mercedes, a mansion with a pool.

my lifes on a bus stop just waiting for some fuel.



your obviousness disgusts me i see thru your macho.

lies.

i will fight everything you stand for.

theres something in your purse baby, my head is.

getting sore.

maybe what we had was just green corn.
