do as i say not as i do because.
the shits so deep you can not run away.
i beg to differ on the contrary.
i agree with every word that you say.
talk is cheap and lies are expensive.
my wallet us fat and so is my head.
hit and run and then i will hit you again.
i am a smart ass but i am playing dumb.

standards set and broken all the time.
control the chaos behind a gun.
call it as i see it even if.
i was born deaf, blind and dumb.
losers winning big on the lottery.
rehab rejects still sniffing glue.
constant refutation with myself.
i am a victim of a catch 22.

i have no belief.
but i believe.
i am a walking contradiction.
and i aingt got no right.
