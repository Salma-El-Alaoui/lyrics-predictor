truth covered in security.
i can not let you smother me.
id like to but it could not work.
trading off and taking turns.
i do not regret a thing.

i have got this friend, you see.
who makes me feel and i.
wanted more than i could steal.
i will arrest myself, i will wear a shield.
i will go out of my way to prove i still.
smell her on you.

do not tell me what i wanna hear.
afraid of never knowing fear.
experience anything you need.
i will keep fighting jealousy.
until its fighting gone.

and i have got this friend, you see.
who makes me feel and i.
wanted more than i could steal.
i will arrest myself, i will wear a shield.
i will go out of my way to prove i still.
smell her on you.
