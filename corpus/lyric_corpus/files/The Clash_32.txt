someone lights a cigarette.
while riding in a car.
some ol guy takes a swig.
and passes back the jar.
but where they were last night.
no one can remember.
somebody got murdered.
goodbye, for keeps, forever.

somebody got murdered.
somebodys dead forever.

and you are minding your own business.
carrying spare change.
you would not cosh a barber.
you are hungry all the same.
i been very tempted.
to grab it from the till.
i been very hungry.
but not enough to kill.

somebody got murdered.
his name cannot be found.
a small stain on the pavement.
they will scrub it off the ground.
as the daily crown disperses.
no one says that much.
somebody got murdered.
and it left me with a touch.

somebody got murdered.
somebodys dead forever.
sounds like murder!
those shouts!
are they drunk down below?

its late, and my watch stopped.
some time ago.
sounds like murder!
those screams!
are they drunk down below?
