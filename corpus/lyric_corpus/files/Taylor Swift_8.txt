drew looks at me.
i fake a smile so he will not see.
what i want and i need.
and everything that we should be.

i will bet shes beautiful.
that girl he talks about.
and shes got everything.
that i have to live without.

drew talks to me.
i laugh cause its so damn funny.
that i can not even see.
anyone when hes with me.

he says hes so in love.
hes finally got it right.
i wonder if he knows.
hes all i think about at night.

hes the reason for the teardrops on my guitar.
the only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star.
hes the song in the car i keep singing.
do not know why i do.

drew walks by me.
can he tell that i can not breathe.
and there he goes, so perfectly.
the kind of flawless i wish i could be.

she better hold him tight.
give him all her love.
look in those beautiful eyes.
and know shes lucky cause.

hes the reason for the teardrops on my guitar.
the only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star.
hes the song in the car i keep singing.
do not know why i do.

so i drive home alone.
as i turn out the light.
i will put his picture down.
and maybe get some sleep tonight.

hes the reason for the teardrops on my guitar.
the only one whos got enough of me to break my heart.
hes the song in the car i keep singing.
do not know why i do.

hes the time taken up.
but theres never enough.
and hes all that i need to fall into.

drew looks at me.
i fake a smile so he will not see.
