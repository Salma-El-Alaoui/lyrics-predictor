i dreamed i was missing, you were so scared.
but no one would listen cause no one else cared.
after my dreaming, i woke with this fear.
what am i leaving when i am done here?

so if you are asking me, i want you to know.

when my time comes, forget the wrong that i have done.
help me leave behind some reasons to be missed.
and do not resent me, and when you are feeling empty.
keep me in your memory, leave out all the rest.

leave out all the rest, do not be afraid.
i have taken my beating, i have shared what i made.
i am strong on the surface, not all the way through.
i have never been perfect, but neither have you.

so if you are asking me, i want you to know.

when my time comes, forget the wrong that i have done.
help me leave behind some reasons to be missed.
and do not resent me, and when you are feeling empty.
keep me in your memory, leave out all the rest.
leave out all the rest.

forgetting   all the hurt inside you have learned to hide so well.
pretending   someone else can come and save me from myself.
i can not be who you are.
