i leave the gas on.
walk the allies in the dark.
sleep with candles burning.
i leave the door unlocked.
i am weaving a rope and.
running all the red lights.
did i get your attention.
cause i am sending.
all the signs and.
the clock is ticking.
and i will be giving.
my 2 weeks.

pick your favorite.
shade of black.
youd best.
prepare a speech.
say something funny.
say something sweet.
but do not say.
that you loved me.

chorus.
cause i am still breathing.
though we have been.
ddead for awhile.
this sickness has no cure.
we are goin down for sure.
already lost a grip.
best abandon ship.

maybe i was too pale.
maybe i was too fat.
maybe you wanted better.
better luck off in the sack.
no formal education.
and i swore way too much.
but i swear.
you did not fucking care.
cause we were in love.

so as i write this letter.
and shed my last tear.
no, its all for the better.
that we end this this year.
let us close this chapter.
say one last prayer.
but do not say.
that you loved me.

chorus.
i am still breathing.
i am still breathing.
