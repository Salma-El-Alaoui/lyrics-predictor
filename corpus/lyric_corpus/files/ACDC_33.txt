outta my way i am a runnin high.
take your chance with me and i will give it a try.
aingt no woman in the world i know.
cause i aingt looking for an overflow.
oh baby i aingt got much.
resistance to your touch.
take off the high heels, let down your hair.
paradise aingt far from there.

i wanna walk all over you.
i wanna walk all over you.
do anything you want me to, baby.
i wanna walk all over you.

reflections on the bedroom wall.
and girl you thought youd seen it all.
we are rising, falling like the sea.
you are looking so good under me.

i am gonna walk all over you.
i am gonna walk all over you.
do anything you want me to do to you.
i am gonna walk all over you.

moanin, groanin stereo.
said gimme the stage, i am gonna steal the show.
leave on the lace and turn off the light.
tonight is gonna be the night.

i am gonna walk all over you.
i am gonna walk all over you.
do anything you want me to.
i am gonna walk all over you.

ow, i am gonna walk all over you.
