bright morning lights.
wipe the sleep from another days eye.
turn away from the wall.
and theres nothing at all.
being naked and afraid.
in the open space of my bed.

i will be with you now.
i will be with you now.
i will be with you now.
we lie on a cloud.
we lie...

just as i am.
i awoke with a tear on my tongue.
i awoke with a feeling of never before.
in my sleep i discover the one.
but she ran with the morning sun.

i will be with you now.
i will be with you now.
i will be with you now.
we lie on a cloud.


we lie...
another time, another place.
we lie...
another child has lost the race.
we lie...
another time, another place.
we lie...
your time, your price.

we lie...
another time, another place.
we lie...
another child has lost...

gaelic words...

we lie...
another time, another place.
we lie...
your time, your place.
