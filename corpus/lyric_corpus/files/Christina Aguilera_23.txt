look at me.
you may think you see.
who i really am.
but you will never know me.
every day.
its as if i play a part.
now i see.
if i wear a mask.
i can fool the world.
but i cannot fool my heart.

who is that girl i see.
staring straight back at me?
when will my reflection show.
who i am inside?

i am now.
in a world where i.
have to hide my heart.
and what i believe in.
but somehow.
i will show the world.
whats inside my heart.
and be loved for who i am.

who is that girl i see.
staring straight back at me?
why is my reflection.
someone i do not know?
must i pretend that i am.
someone else for all time?
when will my reflection show.
who i am inside?

theres a heart that must be.
free to fly.
that burns with a need to know.
the reason why.

why must we all conceal.
what we think, how we feel?
must there be a secret me.
i am forced to hide?
i will not pretend that i am.
someone else for all time.
when will my reflection show.
who i am inside?
when will my reflection show.
who i am inside?
