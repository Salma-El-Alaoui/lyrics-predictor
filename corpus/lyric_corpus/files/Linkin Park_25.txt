i am tired of being what you want me to be.
feeling so faithless.
lost under the surface.
do not know what you are expecting of me.
put under the pressure of walking in your shoes.
caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow.
every step that i take is another mistake to you.
caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow.

i have become so numb.
i can not feel you there.
i have become so tired.
so much more aware.
i am becoming this.
all i want to do.
is be more like me.
and be less like you.

ca not you see that you are smothering me?
holding too tightly.
afraid to lose control.
cause everything that you thought i would be.
has fallen apart.
right in front of you.
caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow.
every step that i take is another mistake to you.
caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow.
and every second i waste is more than i can take.

i have become so numb.
i can not feel you there.
i have become so tired.
so much more aware.
i am becoming this.
all i want to do.
is be more like me.
and be less like you.

and i know i may end up failing too.
but i know you were just like me with someone disappointed in you.

i have become so numb.
i can not feel you there.
i have become so tired.
so much more aware.
i am becoming this.
all i want to do.
is be more like me.
and be less like you.

i have become so numb.
i can not feel you there.
i am tired of being what you want me to be.
i have become so numb.
i can not feel you there.
i am tired of being what you want me to be.
