i was not jealous before we met.
now every woman i see is a potential threat.
and i am possessive it is not nice.
you have heard me saying that smoking was my only vice.
but now it is not true.
now everything is new.
and all i have learned.
has overturned.
i beg of you...

do not go wasting your emotion.
lay all your love on me.

it was like shooting a sitting duck.
a little small talk a smile and baby i was stuck.
i still do not know what you have done with me.
a grown up woman should never fall so easily.
i feel a kind of fear.
when i do not have you near.
unsatisfied.
i skip my pride.
i beg you dear...

do not go wasting your emotion.
lay all your love on me.
do not go sharing your devotion.
lay all your love on me.

i have had a few little love affairs.
they did not last very long and they have been pretty scarce.
i used to think that was sensible.
it makes the truth even more incomprehensible.
cause everything is new.
and everything is you.
and all i have learned.
has overturned.
what can i do...

do not go wasting your emotion.
lay all your love on me.
do not go sharing your devotion.
lay all your love on me repeat 2x and fade.
