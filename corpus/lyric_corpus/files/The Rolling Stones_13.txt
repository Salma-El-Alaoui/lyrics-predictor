i met a gin soaked bar room queen in memphis.
she tried to take me upstairs for a ride.
she had to heave me right across her shoulder.
cause i just can not seem to drink you off my mind.

its the honky tonk women.
gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues.

i laid a divorce in new york city.
i had to put up some kind of a fight.
the lady then she covered me in roses.
she blew my nose and then she blew my mind.

its the honky tonk women.
gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues.

its the honky tonk women.
gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues.

its the honky tonk women.
gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues.
