she can not hide no matter how hard she tries.
her secret disguised behind the lies.
and at night she cries away her pride.
with eyes shut tight.
staring at her inside.

all her friends know why she can not sleep at night.
all her family asking if shes alright.
all she wants to do is get rid of this hell.
well all shes gotta do is stop kidding herself.

she can only fool herself for so long.
she can only fool herself for so long.
she can only fool herself for so long.
i am too weak to face me.

i never know just why you run.
so far away, far away from me.
i never know just why you run.
so far away, far away from me.

when it comes to how to live his life he can not be told.
says hes got it all under control.
thinks he knows its not a problem hes stuck with.
but in reality.
itd be a problem to just quit.
an addict and he can not hold the reins.
the pain is worse cause his friends have it the same.
tries to slow down the problem hes got.
but cant get off the carousel until he makes it stop.

he can only fool himself for so long.
he can only fool himself for so long.
he can only fool himself for so long.
i am too weak to face me.

i never know just why you run.
so far away, far away from me.
i never know just why you run.
so far away, far away from me.

fly with me upon the wings i gave you.
try to be closer to me i will save you.
fly with me upon the wings i gave you.

i never know just why you run.
so far away, far away from me.
