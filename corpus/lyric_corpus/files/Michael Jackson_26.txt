girl, close your eyes.
let that rhythm get into you.
do not try to fight it.
there aingt nothing that you can do.
relax your mind.
lay back and groove with mine.
you got to feel that heat.
and we can ride the boogie.
share that beat of love.

i wanna rock with you all night.
dance you into day sunlight.
i wanna rock with you all night.
we are gonna rock the night away.

out on the floor.
there aingt nobody there but us.
girl, when you dance.
theres a magic that must be love.
just take it slow.
cause we got so far to go.
when you feel that heat.
and we are gonna ride the boogie.
share that beat of love.

i wanna rock with you all night.
dance you into day sunlight.
i wanna rock with you all night.
we are gonna rock the night away.

and when the groove is dead and gone... yeah.
you know that love survives.
so we can rock forever, on.

i wanna rock with you.
i wanna groove with you.

i wanna rock with you.
i wanna groove with you.

i wanna rock all night with you girl sunlight.
