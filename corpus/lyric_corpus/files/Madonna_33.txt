i feel it.
its coming.

rain... feel it on my finger tips.
hear it on my window pane.
your loves coming down like rain...
wash away my sorrow.
take away my pain.
your loves coming down like rain...

when your lips are burning mine.
and you take the time.
to tell me how you feel.
when you listen to my words.
and i know you have heard.
i know its real.
rain is what this thunder brings.
for the first time, i can hear my heart sing.
call me a fool but i know i am not.
i am gonna stand out here on the mountain top.
till i feel your.

rain... feel it on my finger tips.
hear it on my window pane.
your loves coming down like rain...
wash away my sorrow, take away my pain.
your loves coming down like rain...

when you looked into my eyes.
and you said goodbye.
could you see my tears...
when i turned the other way.
did you hear me say.
id wait for all the dark clouds bursting in a perfect sky.
you promised me when you said goodbye.
that youd return when the storm was done.
and now i wait for the light.
i will wait for the sun, till i feel your.

rain... feel it on my finger tips.
hear it on the window pane.
your loves coming down like rain...
wash away my sorrow, take away my pain.
your loves coming down like.

here comes the sun.
here comes the sun.
and i say... never go away...

waiting is the hardest thing its strange.
i tell myself that if i believe in you i feel like i have known you before.
in the dream of you i want to understand you more.
with all my heart and all my soul and more and more.
that by sheer force of will when i am with you.
i will raise you from the ground i feel like a magical child.
and without a sound you will appear everything strange.
and surrender to me everything wild.
to love.

rain is what the thunder brings.
for the first time, i can hear my heart sing.
call me a fool but i know i am not.
i am gonna stand out here on the mountain top.
till i feel your.
