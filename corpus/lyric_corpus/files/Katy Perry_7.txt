i am out on my own again.
face down in the porcelain.
feeling so high but looking so low.
party favors on the floor.
drunk girls banging on the door.
so many new friends, though.

have you ever been so lost.
fell off track and paid the cost.

caught in the eye of a hurricane.
stuck on the worst float in the parade.
so sick of this town pulling me down.
my mother says i should come back home but.
ca not find the way cause the way is gone.
so if i pray am i just sending words into outer space.


have you ever been so lost.
known the way and still so lost.
another night waiting for someone to take me home.
have you ever been so lost.


is there a light.
is there a light.
at the end of the road.
i am pushing everyone away.
cause i can not feel this anymore.
ca not feel this anymore.


have you ever been so lost.
known the way and still so lost.
another night waiting for someone to take me home.
have you ever been so lost.
have you ever been so lost.
