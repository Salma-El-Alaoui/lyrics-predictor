verse 1.
each day i live.
i want to be a day to give the best of me.
i am only one, but not alone.
my finest day is yet unknown.
i broke my heart, for evry gain.
to taste the sweet, i face the pain.
i rise and fall, yet through it all, this much remains.
i want...

chorus.
one moment in time.
when i am more than i thought i could be.
when all of my dreams are a heartbeat away.
and the answers are all up to me.
give me one moment in time.
when i am racing with destiny.
then in that one moment of time.
i will feel, i will feel eternity.

verse 2.
i have lived to be the very best.
i want it all, no time for less.
i have laid the plans.
now lay the chance, here in my hands.
give me...

chorus x2.

bridge.
you are a winner, for a lifetime.
if you seize that one moment in time.
make it shine.
give me...

chorus x2.

i will be, i will be free..
