my breath smells of a thousand fags.
and when i am drunk i dance like me dad.
i have started to dress a bit like him.
early morning when i wake up.
i look like kiss but without the make up.
and thats a good line to take it to the bridge.

and you know and you know.
coz my lifes a mess.
and i am trying to grow so before.
i am old i will confess.
you think that i am strong you are wrong.
you are wrong.
i will sing my song my song my song.

my beds full of takeaways and fantasies.
of easy lays.
the pause buttons broke on my video.
and is this real coz i feel fake.
oprah winfrey rikki lake.
teach me things i do not need to know.

and you know and you know.
coz my lifes a mess.
and its starting to show so before.
i am old i will confess.
you think that i am strong you are wrong.
you are wrong.
i will sing my song my song my song.

if i did it all again id be a nun.
the rain was never cold when i was young.
i am still young we are still young.
lifes too short to be afraid.
step inside the sun.

and you know and you know.
cos my lifes a mess.
and i am trying to grow.

you think that i am strong you are wrong.
you are wrong.
i will sing my song my song my song.

you think that i am strong you are wrong.
you are wrong.
i will sing my song my song my song.

lifes too short to be afraid.
so take a pill to numb the pain.
you do not have to take the blame.

lifes too short to be afraid.
so take a pill to numb the pain.

lifes too short to be afraid.
