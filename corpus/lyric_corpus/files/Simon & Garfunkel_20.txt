hallelujah!
go tell it on the mountain.
over the hills and everywhere.
go tell it on the mountain.
jesus christ is born.

down the lonely manger.
the humble christ was born.
and god sent salvation.
that blessed christmas morn.

repeat chorus.

while shepherds kept their watch.
oer silent flocks by night.
behold throughout the heavens.
there shown a holy light.

repeat chorus and 1st verse.

repeat chorus.
