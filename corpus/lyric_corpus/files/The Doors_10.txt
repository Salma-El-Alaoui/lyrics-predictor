let us swim to the moon.
let us climb through the tide.
penetrate the evening that the.
city sleeps to hide.
let us swim out tonight love.
its our time to try.
park besides the ocean.
on our moonlight drive.

let us swim to the moon.
let us climb through the tide.
surrender to the waking world that.
laps against our side.
nothing left open and.
no time to decide.
we will stop into a river.
on our moonlight drive.

let us swim to the moon.
let us climb through the tide.
you will reach your hand to hold me.
but i can not be your guide.
its easy to love you.
as i watch you glide.
falling through wet forests.
on our moonlight drive, baby.
moonlight drive.

come on baby, gonna take a little ride.
come on, down by the oceanside.
gonna get real close, get real tight.
baby, gonna drown tonight.
gonna drown, drown, drown.
