i have made up my mind.
do not need to think it over.
if i am wrong, i am right.
do not need to look no further.
this aingt lust, i know this is love.

but if i tell the world.
i will never say enough.
cause it was not said to you.
and thats exactly what i need to do.
if i end up with you.

should i give up.
or should i just keep chasing pavements.
even if it leads nowhere.
or would it be a waste.
even if i knew my place.
should i leave it there.

should i give up.
or should i just keep chasing pavements.
even if it leads nowhere.

i build myself up.
and fly around in circles.
waiting as my heart drops.
and my back begins to tingle.
finally could this be it.

or should i give up.
or should i just keep chasing pavements.
even if it leads nowhere.
or would it be a waste.
even if i knew my place.
should i leave it there.
should i give up.
or should i just keep chasing pavements.
even if it leads nowhere.

yeaaah ehh.

should i give up.
or should i just keep chasing pavements.
even if it leads nowhere.
or would it be a waste.
even if i knew my place.
should i leave it there.
should i give up.
or should i just keep on chasing pavements.
should i just keep on chasing pavements.

ohhhh ohh.

should i give up.
or should i just keep chasing pavements.
even if it leads nowhere.
or would it be a waste.
even if i knew my place.
should i leave it there.
should i give up.
or should i just keep chasing pavements.
even if it leads nowhere.
