lazy days calling to you.
come out and play, the future lies with you.
now you can be sure love is the cure.
what we are searching for is to have a jolly good time.
crazy days but you will get me through.
and here i will stay holding on to you.
now you can be sure our thoughts unpure.
we will unlock the door and we will have a jolly good time.
it can happen in any season.
we do not need any reason to sit around and wait.
the world can change in a second.
so i find the sunshine beckons me.
to open up the gate and dream.
and dream.
lazy days, do not let them get you down.
wear your smile, i do not want to see you frown.
do not let them get you down.
it can happen in any season.
we do not need any reason to sit around and wait.
the world can change in a second.
so i find the sunshine beckons me.
to open up the gate and dream.
and dream.
then we will have a jolly good time.
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.........
