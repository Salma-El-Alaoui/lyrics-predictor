thats m o n e y, so sexy, i.
damn i love the jag, the jet and the mansion.

and i enjoy the gifts and trips to the islands.

its good to live expensive you know it but.
my knees get weak, intensive.

when you give me k kisses.
thats money honey.
when i am your lover and your mistress.
thats money honey.
when you touch me its so delicious.
thats money honey.
baby when you tear me to pieces.
thats money honey.

thats money honey.

damn id love a boat by the beach on the west coast.
oh yea.
and id enjoy some fine champagne while my girls toast.

its good to live expensive you know it but.
my knees get weak, intensive.

chorus.
you know i appreciate the finer things.
but its not what makes me happiest baby.
i can do without it babe.
your tender lovings more than i can handle.
never burn out this candle baby, baby.
