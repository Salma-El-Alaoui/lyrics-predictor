real life is so hard.
we hide in the stars.
thats where our heads are.
my head and your heart.

chorus.
this a black out.
do not let it go to waste.
this is a black out.
i want to detonate.

when you are so far.
i am falling apart.
lose all my sonar.
you jam my radar.

chorus.

sometimes i feel like getting stuck.
between the handshake and the fuck.

you have got me on guard.
i have got my headstart.
my head and your heart.
the same in the stars.

chorus.

sometimes i wish that i could change.
i can not save you from my poor brain.
ok
