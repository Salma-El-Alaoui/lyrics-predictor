living easy, living free.
season ticket, on a one   way ride.
asking nothing, leave me be.
taking everything in my stride.

aingt nothing i would rather do.
going down, party time.

i am on the highway to hell.
highway to hell.
i am on the highway to hell.
highway to hell.

no stop signs, speeding limit.
nobodys gonna slow me down.
like a wheel, gonna spin it.
nobodys gonna mess me round.
hey satan! paid my dues.
playing in a rocking band.
hey mama! look at me.
i am on my way to the promise land.

i am on the highway to hell.
highway to hell.
i am on the highway to hell.
