late at night all systems go.
you have come to see the show.
we do our best you are the rest.
you make it real you know.
there is a feeling deep inside.
that drives you fucking mad.
a feeling of a hammerhead.
you need it oh so bad.

adrenalin starts to flow.
you are thrashing all around.
acting like a maniac.
whiplash.

bang your head against the stage.
like you never did before.
make it ring make it bleed.
make it really sore.
in a frenzied madness.
with your leather and your spikes.
heads are bobbing all around.
it is hot as hell tonight.

adrenalin starts to flow.
you are thrashing all around.
acting like a maniac.
whiplash.

here on the stage the marshal noise.
is piercing through your ears.
it kicks your ass kick your face.
exploding feeling nears.
now is the time to let it rip.
to let it fucking loose.
we are gathered here to maim and kill.
cause this is what we choose.

adrenalin starts to flow.
you are thrashing all around.
acting like a maniac.
whiplash.

the show is through the metal is gone.
it is time to hit the road.
another town another gig.
again we will explode.
hotel rooms and motorways.
life out here is raw.
but we will never stop.
we will never quit.
cause we are metallica.

adrenalin starts to flow.
you are thrashing all around.
acting like a maniac.
whiplash.
