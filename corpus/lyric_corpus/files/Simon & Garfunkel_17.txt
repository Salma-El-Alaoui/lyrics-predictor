when she goes, shes gone.
if she stays, she stays here.
the girl does what she wants to do.
she knows what she wants to do.
and i know i am faking it.
i am not really making it.

i am such a dubious soul.
and a walk in the garden.
wears me down.
tangled in the fallen vines.
picking up the punch lines.
i have just been faking it.
not really making it.

is there any danger?
no, no not really.
just lean on me.
taking time to treat.
your friendly neighbors honestly.
i have just been faking it.
i am not really making it.
this feeling of faking it.
i still have not shaken it.

prior to this lifetime.
i surely was a tailor.
i own the tailors face and hands.
i am the tailors face and hands and.
i know i am faking it.
i am not really making it.
this feeling of faking it.
i still have not shaken it..
