where you are seems to be as far as an eternity.
outstretched arms, open hearts.
if it never ends, then when do we start?

i will never leave you behind.
or treat you unkind.
i know you understand.
and with a tear in my eye.
give me the sweetest goodbye.
that i ever did receive.

pushing forward and arching back.
bring me closer to heart attack.
say goodbye and just fly away.
when you come back.
i have something to say.

how does it feel to know you will never have to be alone.
when you get home?
there must be someplace here that only you and i could go.
so i can show you how i..

dream away everyday.
try so hard to disregard.
the rhythm of the rain that drops.
and coincides with the beating of my heart.

i will never leave you behind.
or treat you unkind.
i know you understand.
and with a tear in my eye.
give me the sweetest goodbye.
that i ever ever ever did receive.

how does it feel to know you will never have to be alone.
when you get home?
there must be someplace here that only you and i could go.
so i can show you how i feel.

how does it feel to know you will never have to be alone.
when you get home?
there must be someplace here that only you and i could go.
so i can show you how i feel.. feel.. feel.. feel.
