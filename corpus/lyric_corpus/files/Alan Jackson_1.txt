let us begin with the day i met her.
how fast this good old boys world got better.
the sky got bluer, the grass got greener.
just the first few seconds after i first seen her.

like my, favorite song on a new set of speakers.
my best old jeans and my broken sneakers.
a home run pitch floatin right down the middle.
sweet music made when the bow hits the fiddle.

chorus.
shes, right on the money.
she goes direct, to my heart.
when it comes to loving me.
shes everything i need.
bulls eye perfect.
shes, right on the money.

shes no red lights, when ive over slept.
shes a three point jump shot thats nothin but net.
a hand full of aces when the dealers done dealin.
im forever on a roll thats how shes, got me feelin.

chorus.

shes the best cook thats ever melted cheese.
i aingt much around the house, but i aim to please.
theres absolutley no reason to doubt it.
when she says i would not last ten minutes without her.

chorus.
