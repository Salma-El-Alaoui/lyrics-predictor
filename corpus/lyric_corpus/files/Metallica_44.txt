welcome to where time stands still.
no one leaves and no one will.
moon is full, never seems to change.
just labeled mentally deranged.

dream the same thing every night.
i see our freedom in my sight.
no locked doors, no windows barred.
no things to make my brain seem scarred.

sleep my friend and you will see.
that dream is my reality.
they keep me locked up in this cage.
ca not they see its why my brain says rage.

sanitarium, leave me be.
sanitarium, just leave me alone.

build my fear of whats out there.
and cannot breathe the open air.
whisper things into my brain.
assuring me that i am insane.

they think our heads are in their hands.
but violent use brings violent plans.
keep him tied, it makes him well.
hes getting better, can not you tell?

no more can they keep us in.
listen, damn it, we will win.
they see it right, they see it well.
but they think this saves us from our hell.

sanitarium, leave me be.
sanitarium, just leave me alone.
sanitarium, just leave me alone.

fear of living on.
natives getting restless now.
mutiny in the air.
got some death to do.
mirror stares back hard.
kill, its such a friendly word.
seems the only way.
for reaching out again..
