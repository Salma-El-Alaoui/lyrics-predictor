i am   a little bit of loneliness, a little bit of disregard.
a handful of complaints, but i can not help the fact that everyone can see these scars.
i am   what i want you to want, what i want you to feel.
but its like no matter what i do i can not convince you to just believe this is real.
so i let go watching you.
turn your back like you always do.
face away and pretend that i am not.
but i will be here because you are all that i got.

i can not feel   the way i did before.
do not turn your back on me, i will not be ignored.
time will not heal   this damage anymore.
do not turn your back on me, i will not be ignored.

i am   a little bit insecure, a little unconfident.
because you do not understand, i do what i can, but sometimes i do not make sense.
i am   what you never want to say, but i have never had a doubt.
its like no matter what i do i can not convince you for once just to hear me out.
so i let go, watching you.
turn your back like you always do.
face away and pretend that i am not.
but i will be here because you are all that i got.

i can not feel   the way i did before.
do not turn your back on me, i will not be ignored.
time will not heal   this damage anymore.
do not turn your back on me, i will not be ignored.

no, hear me out now.
you are going to listen to me like it or not.
right now.
hear me out now.
you are going listen to me like it or not.
right now.

i can not feel the way i did before.
do not turn your back on me, i will not be ignored.

i can not feel   the way i did before.

i can not feel.
do not turn your back on me, i will not be ignored.
time will not heal.
do not turn your back on me, i will not be ignored.
