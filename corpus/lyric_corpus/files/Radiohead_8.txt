i do not want to be crippled and cracked.
shoulders, wrists, knees and back.
ground to dust and ash.
crawling on all fours.

when you have got to feel it in your bones.
when you have got to feel it in your bones.

now i can not climb the stairs.
pieces missing everywhere.
prozac painkillers.

when you have got to feel it in your bones.
when you have got to feel it in your bones.

and i used to fly like peter pan.
all the children flew when i touched their hands.

when you have got to feel it in your bones.
when you have got to feel it in your bones.
