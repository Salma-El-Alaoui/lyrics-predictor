everything you are.
everything you will be.
touches the current of love.
so deep in me.
every sigh in the night.
every tear that you cry.
seduces me.

and all that i am.
and all that i will be.
means nothing at all.
if you can not be with me.
your most innocent kiss.
or your sweetest caress.
seduces me.

i do not care about tomorrow.
i have given up on yesterday.
here and now is all that matters.
right here with you is where i will stay.

everything in this world.
every voice in the night.
every little thing of beauty.
comes shining thru in your eyes.
and all that is you becomes part of me too.
cause all you do seduces me.

and if i should die tomorrow.
id go down with a smile on my face.
i thank god i have ever known you.
i fall down on my knees.
for all the love we have made.

every sigh in the night.
every tear that you cry.
seduces me seduces me.
all that you do , , , .. seduces me.
