well shes fashionably lean.
and shes fashionably late.
she will never wreck a scene.
she will never break a date.

but shes no drag, just watch the way she walks.

shes a twentieth century fox.
shes a twentieth century fox.
no tears, no fears.
no ruined years, no clocks.
shes a twentieth century fox, oh yeah.

shes the queen of cool.
and shes the lady who waits.
since her mind left school.
it never hesitates.

she will not waste time on elementary talk.

cause shes a twentieth century fox.
shes a twentieth century fox.
got the world locked up.
inside a plastic box.
shes a twentieth century fox, oh yeah.
twentieth century fox, oh yeah.
twentieth century fox.
shes a twentieth century fox.
