well she looked a peach in the dress she made.
when she was still her mamas little girl.
and when she walked down the aisle everybody smiled.
at her innocence and curls.
and when the preacher said is there anyone here.
got a reason why they should not wed.
i should have stuck up my hand.
i should have got up to stand.
and this is what i should have said.

i wanna kiss the bride yeah!
i wanna kiss the bride yeah!
long before she met him.
she was mine, mine, mine.
do not say i do.
say bye, bye, bye.
and let me kiss the bride yeah!

underneath her veil i could see a tear.
trickling down her pretty face.
and when she slipped on the ring i knew everything.
would never be the same again.
but if the groom would have known hed have had a fit.
about his wife and the things we did.
and what i planned to say.
yeah on her wedding day.
well i thought it but i kept it hid.
