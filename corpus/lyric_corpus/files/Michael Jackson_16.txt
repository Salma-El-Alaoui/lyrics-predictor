looking out.
across the night time.
the city winks a sleepless eye.
hear her voice.
shake my window.
sweet seducing sighs.

get me out.
into the night time.
four walls will not hold me tonight.
if this town.
is just an apple.
then let me take a bite.

chorus.
if they say  .
why, why, tell em that is human nature.
why, why, does he do me that way.
if they say  .
why, why, tell em that is human nature.
why, why, does he do me that way.


reaching out.
to touch a stranger.
electric eyes are evrywhere.
see that girl.
she knows i am watching.
she likes the way i stare.

chorus.
if they say  .
why, why, tell em that is human nature.
why, why, does he do me that way.
if they say  .
why, why, tell em that is human nature.
why, why, does he do me that way.
i like living this way.
i like loving this way.
instrumental section.

looking out.
across the morning.
the citys heart begins to beat.
reaching out.
i touch her shoulder.
i am dreaming of the street.

chorus.
if they say  .
why, why, tell em that is human nature.
why, why, does he do me that way.
if they say  .
why, why, tell em that is human nature.
why, why, does he do me that way.
i like living this way.
