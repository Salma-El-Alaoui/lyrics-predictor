when this began.
i had nothing to say.
and id get lost in the nothingness inside of me.
i was confused.
and i let it all out to find that.
i am not the only person with these things in mind.
inside of me.
but all the vacancy the words revealed.
is the only real thing that i have got left to feel.
nothing to lose.
just stuck, hollow and alone.
and the fault is my own.
and the fault is my own.

i want to heal, i want to feel.
what i thought was never real.
i want to let go of the pain i have held so long.
erase all the pain til its gone.
i want to heal, i want to feel.
like i am close to something real.
i want to find something i have wanted all along.
somewhere i belong.

and i have got nothing to say.
i cant believe i did not fall right down on my face.
i was confused.
looking everywhere only to find that its.
not the way i had imagined it all in my mind.
so what am i.
what do i have but negativity.
cause i can not justify the way everyone is looking at me.
nothing to lose.
nothing to gain, hollow and alone.
and the fault is my own.
and the fault is my own.

i want to heal, i want to feel.
what i thought was never real.
i want to let go of the pain i have held so long.
erase all the pain til its gone.
i want to heal, i want to feel.
like i am close to something real.
i want to find something i have wanted all along.
somewhere i belong.

i will never know.
myself until i do this on my own.
and i will never feel.
anything else until my wounds are healed.
i will never be.
anything til i break away from me.
and i will break away.
i will find myself today.

i want to heal, i want to feel.
what i thought was never real.
i want to let go of the pain i have held so long.
erase all the pain til its gone.
i want to heal, i want to feel.
like i am close to something real.
i want to find something i have wanted all along.
somewhere i belong.

i want to heal, i want to feel like.
i am somewhere i belong.
i want to heal, i want to feel like.
i am somewhere i belong.
somewhere i belong.
