yeah excuse me.

hi my name is bob and i work at my job.
i make forty some dollars a day.
i used to be the man in my hometown.
til i started to lose my way.
it all goes back to when i dropped out at school.
having fun, i was living the life.
but now i got a problem with that little white rock.
see i can not put down the pipe.


and itis breaking me down.
watching the world spin round.
while my dreams fall down.
is anybody out there?

it is breaking me down.
no more friends around...
and my dreams fall down...
is anybody out there?

can anybody out there hear me?
cause i can not seem to hear myself.
can anybody out there see me?
cause i can not seem to see myself...
theres gotta be a heaven somewhere.
can you save me from this hell?
can anybody out there feel me?
cause i can not seem to feel myself.

losing my way.
keep losing my way...
keep losing my way...
can you help me find my way?
losing my way.
keep losing my way.
keep losing my way...
can you help me find my way?

now you gotta understand i was a family man.
i would have done anything for my own.
but i could not get a grip on my new found itch.
so i ended up all alone.
i remember where i was when i got my first buzz.
see i thought i was living the life.
and the craziest thing is i will probably never know the color of my daughters eyes.

and it is breaking me down.
watching the world spin round.
while my dreams fall down.
