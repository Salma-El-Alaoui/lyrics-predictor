now i could lie by your side.
all serrated for you.
down below cancer grows.
weeping waits inside you too.
all our rage begs a stage.
its a waste of time though.
and you style seems worthwhile.
but this lonely road has turned and you faded there.
they pretend to care.
vultures waiting.
if you do not like me.
certify me yeah i do not know.
yeah i will not go.
yeah save it i am okay.

and in the sun a loaded gun.
makes for conversation.
all the while in denial.
its too late for me to change.

and you were unchanged.
nothing more had changed.
i could fake it.
if you still hate me.
confiscate me.

oh we are jaded i do not know.
overrated i will not go.
all serrated save it i am okay.
okay yeah i will not play.
yeah go away.
yeah save it i am okay.
