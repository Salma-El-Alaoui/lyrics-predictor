well, theres a bridge and theres a river.
that i still must cross.
as i am going on my journey.
oh, i might be lost.

and theres a road i have to follow.
a place i have to go.
but no one told me just how to get there.
but when i get there i will know.
cause i am taking it...

step by step.
bit by bit.
stone by stone.
brick by brick.

step by step.
day by day.
mile by mile.
go your own way.

and this old road is rough and ruined.
so many dangers along the way.
so many burdens might fall upon me.
so many troubles that i have to face.

but i will not let my spirit fail me.
but i will not let my spirit go.
until i get to my destination.
i am gonna take it slow.
because i am taking it...

chorus.

say baby, do not give up.
you have got to hold on to what you have got.
oh, baby, do not give up.
you have go to keep on moving.
do not stop.
yeah, yeah.

i know you are hurting.
i know you are blue.
i know you are hurting.
but do not let the bad things get to you.
i am taking it...

chorus.

cmon baby, gotta keep moving ad lib.
