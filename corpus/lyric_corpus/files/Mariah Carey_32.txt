ooh, ooh, sweet love, yeah.

i did not mean it.
when i said i did not love you, so.
i should have held on tight.
i never shoulda let you go.
i did not know nothing.
i was stupid, i was foolish.
i was lying to myself.
i could not fathom that i would ever.
be without your love.
never imagined id be.
sitting here beside myself.
cause i did not know you.
cause i did not know me.
but i thought i knew everything.
i never felt.

the feeling that i am feeling.
now that i do not hear your voice.
or have your touch and kiss your lips.
cause i do not have a choice.
oh, what i would not give.
to have you lying by my side.
right here, cause baby.

we belong together.

chorus.
when you left i lost a part of me.
its still so hard to believe.
come back baby, please.
cause we belong together.
who else am i gon lean on.
when times get rough.
whos gonna talk to me on the phone.
till the sun comes up.
whos gonna take your place.
there aingt nobody better.
oh, baby baby, we belong together.

i can not sleep at night.
when you are on my mind.
bobby womacks on the radio.
saying to me.
if you think you are lonely now.
wait a minute.
this is too deep too deep.
i gotta change the station.
so i turn the dial.
trying to catch a break.
and then i hear babyface.
i only think of you.
and its breaking my heart.
i am trying to keep it together.
but i am falling apart.

i am feeling all out of my element.
i am throwing things, crying.
trying to figure out.
where the hell i went wrong.
the pain reflected in this song.
it aingt even half of what.
i am feeling inside.
i need you.
need you back in my life, baby.

chorus.
when you left i lost a part of me.
its still so hard to believe.
come back baby, please.
cause we belong together.
who else am i gon lean on.
when times get rough.
whos gonna talk to me on the phone.
till the sun comes up.
whos gonna take your place.
there aingt nobody better.
oh, baby baby, we belong together, baby.

chorus.
when you left i lost a part of me.
its still so hard to believe.
come back baby, please.
cause we belong together.
who am i gonna lean on.
when times get rough.
whos gonna talk to me.
till the sun comes up.
whos gonna take your place.
there aingt nobody better.
oh baby, baby.
we belong together.
