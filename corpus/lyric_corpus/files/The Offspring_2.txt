deep inside secrets burning.
i should have known all the while whats true.
i went along, to fool myself.
ca not go on, i can not escape it.

all along.
i think i really knew.
it was there in the words unspoken.
all along.
still believed in you.
now i leave here betrayed and broken.

close my eyes from the burning.
all along, all the while its true.
take it on, or turn your back.
either way, you can not escape it.

all along.
i think i really knew.
it was there in the words unspoken.
all along.
still believed in you.
now i leave here betrayed and broken.

ohhh ohhh oh oh oh.

all along.
i think i really knew.
it was there in the words unspoken.
all along.
still believed in you.
now i leave here betrayed and broken.
all along i still believed in you.
