i can not get no satisfaction.
i can not get no satisfaction.
cause i try, and i try, and i try, and i try.
i can not get no, i can not get no.

when i am driving in my car.
and a man comes on the radio.
hes telling me more and more.
about some useless information.
supposed to fire my imagination.
i can not get no, oh no no no.
hey hey hey, thats what i say.

i can not get no satisfaction.
i can not get no satisfaction.
cause i try, and i try, and i try, and i try.
i can not get no, i can not get no.

when i am watching my tv.
and a man comes on and tells me.
how white my shirts can be.
well he can not be a man cause he does not smoke.
the same cigarettes as me.
i can not get no, oh no no no.
hey hey hey, thats what i say.

i can not get no satisfaction.
i can not get no girl reaction.
cause i try, and i try, and i try, and i try.
i can not get no, i can not get no.

when i am riding round the world.
and i am doing this and i am signing that.
and i am trying to make some girl.
who tells me, baby better come back later next week.
cause you see i am on losing streak.
i can not get no, oh no no no.
hey hey hey, thats what i say.

i can not get no, i can not get no.
i can not get no.
satisfaction, no satisfaction, no satisfaction, no satisfaction.
i can not get no.
