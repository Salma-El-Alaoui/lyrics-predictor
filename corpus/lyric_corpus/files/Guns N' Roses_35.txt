shes got a smile that, it seems to me.
reminds me of childhood memories.
where evrything.
was as fresh as the bright blue sky.

now and then when i see her face.
she takes me away to that special place.
and if i stared too long.
id probably break down and cry.

woah, sweet child o mine.
woah, oh, oh, oh, sweet love of mine.

shes got eyes of the bluest skies.
as if they thought of rain.
id hate to look into those eyes.
and see an ounce of pain.

her hair reminds me of a warm safe place.
where as a child id hide.
and pray for the thunder and the rain.
to quietly pass me by.

woah, sweet child o mine.
woah, oh, oh, oh, sweet love of mine.

ooh, ah.
oh yeah, woah, oh, oh, oh, sweet child o mine.
woah, oh, oh, oh, sweet love of mine.
woah, oh, oh, oh, sweet child o mine, ooh yeah.
ooh, sweet love of mine.

where do we go?
where do we go now?
where do we go?

where do we go?
where do we go now?
aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye.
where do we go now?

where do we go now?
where do we go now?
where do we go?

where do we go?
ooh, where do we go now?
now, now, now, now, now, now, now.
sweet child.
sweet child o mine.
