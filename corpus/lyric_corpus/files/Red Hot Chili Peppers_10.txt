i am an ocean in your bedroom.
make you feel warm.
make you want to re assume.
now we know it all for sure.

i am a dance hall dirty breakbeat.
make the snow fall.
up from underneath your feet.
not alone, i will be there.
tell me when you want to go.

i am a meth lab first rehab.
take it all off.
and step inside the running cab.
theres a love that knows the way.

i am the rainbow in your jail cell.
all the memories of.
everything you have ever smelled.
not alone, i will be there.
tell me when you want to go.

backround.
sideways falling.
more will be revealed my friend.

i am an inbred and a pothead.
two legs that you spread.
inside the tool shed.
now we know it all for sure.

i could show you.
to the free field.
overcome and more.
will always be revealed.
not alone, i will be there.
tell me when you want to go.

backround.
sideways falling.
more will be revealed my friend.

ooooooooh and.
do not forget me.
i can not hide it.

backround.
sideways falling.

ooooooooh and.
do not forget me.
i can not hide it.
theres a match now let me light it.

i am the bloodstain.
on your shirt sleeve.
coming down and more are coming to believe.

up on your arm.

inside the funny farm.
not alone, i will be there.
tell me when you want to go.

i will be there.
