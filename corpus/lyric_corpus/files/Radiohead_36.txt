i sailed the moon.
i spoke too soon.
and how much did it cost?
i was dropped from.
moonbeams.
and sailed on shooting stars.

maybe you will.
be president.
but know right from wrong.
or in the flood.
you will build an ark.

and sail us to the moon.
sail us to the moon.
sail us to the moon.
sail us to the moon.
