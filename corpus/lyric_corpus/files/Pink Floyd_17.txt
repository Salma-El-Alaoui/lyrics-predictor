hey you! out there in the cold.
getting lonely, getting old, can you feel me?
hey you! standing in the aisles.
with itchy feet and fading smiles, can you feel me?
hey you! do not help them to bury the light.
do not give in without a fight.

hey you! out there on your own.
sitting naked by the phone, would you touch me?
hey you! with your ear against the wall.
waiting for someone to call out, would you touch me?
hey you! would you help me to carry the stone?
open your heart, i am coming home.

but it was only a fantasy.
the wall was too high as you can see.
no matter how he tried he could not break free.
and the worms ate into his brain.

hey you! out there on the road.
always doing what you are told, can you help me?
hey you! out there beyond the wall.
breaking bottles in the hall, can you help me?
hey you! do not tell me theres no hope at all.
together we stand, divided we fall.
