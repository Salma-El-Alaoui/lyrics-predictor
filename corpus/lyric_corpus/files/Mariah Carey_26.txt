you were so blind to let me go.
you had it all but did not know.
no one you will find will ever be.
closer to all your dreams than me.
believing the grass would be greener.
you told yourself i just do not need her now.
but i know you will soon discover.
you are never satisfied with any other.

chorus.
someday oo someday.
one you gave away will be the only one you are wishing for.
someday hey hey.
boy you are gonna pay cause baby i am the one whos keeping score.

you will change your mind and call my name.
soon as you find they are all the same.
and when you find yourself alone.
do not come back crying.
you should have known.
believe me i am not pretending.
its not hard to predict.
this ending now.
cause i know you will soon discover.
you are needing me in spite of all the others.

chorus.

maybe now you just can not conceive.
that there will ever come a time when you are cold and lonely.
baby, how could you ever believe.
that another could replace me.
the one and only.
but when your down.
in your time of need.
and you are thinking that you.
might be coming back to own me.
just think again cause.
i will not need your love anymore!

chorus.
