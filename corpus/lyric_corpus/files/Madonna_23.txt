i made it through the wilderness.
somehow i made it through.

until i found you.

i was beat incomplete.

like a virgin.
when your heart beats.
next to mine.

my fear is fading fast.
been saving it all for you.
cause only love can last.

you are so fine and you are mine.

what was scared and cold.

chorus.

i will be yours till the end of time.
cause you made me feel.

when you hold me, and your heart beats, and you love me.
