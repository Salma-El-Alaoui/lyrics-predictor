close your eyes so you do not feel them.
they do not need to see you cry.
i can not promise i will heal you.
but if you want to i will try.
to sing this summer serenade.
the past is done we have been betrayed.
its true.
someone said the truth will out.
i believe without a doubt.
in you.

chorus.
you were there for summer dreaming.
and you gave me what i need.
and i hope you will find your freedom.
for eternity, for eternity.

yesterday when we were walking.
you talked about your ma and dad.
what they did that made you happy.
what they did that made you sad.
we sat and watched the sun go down.
then picked a star before we lost.
the moon.
youth is wasted on the young.
before you know its come and gone,too soon.

you were there for summer dreaming.
and you gave me what i need.
and i hope you will find your freedom.
for eternity, for eternity.

to sing this summer serenade.
the past is done we have been betrayed.
its true.
youth is wasted on the young.
before you know its come and gone.
too soon.

you were there for summer dreaming.
and you are a friend indeed.
and i hope you will find your freedom.
for eternity.
you were there for summer dreaming.
and you gave me what i need.
and i know you will find your freedom.
eventually.
for eternity, for eternity.
