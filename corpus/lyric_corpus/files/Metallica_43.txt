where do i take this pain of mine?
i run but it stays right by my side.

so tear me open, pour me out.
theres things inside that scream and shout.
and the pain still hates me.
so hold me until it sleeps.

just like a curse, just like the stray.
you feed it once and now it stays, now it stays.

so tear me open but beware.
theres things inside without a care.
and the dirt still stains me.
so wash me until i am clean.

it grips you, so hold me.
it stains you, so hold me.
it hates you, so hold me.
it holds you, so hold me.
until it sleeps.

so tell me why you have chosen me.
do not want your grip.
do not want your greed.
do not want it.

i will tear me open, make you gone.
no more can you hurt anyone.
and the fear still shakes me.
so hold me until it sleeps.

it grips you, so hold me.
it stains you, so hold me.
it hates you, so hold me.
it holds you, holds you, holds you.
until it sleeps.

i do not want it, no.

so tear me open but beware.
theres things inside without a care.
and the dirt still stains me.
so wash me til i am clean.

i will tear me open, make you gone.
no longer will you hurt anyone.
and the hate still shakes me.
so hold me until it sleeps.
until it sleeps.
until it sleeps.
until it sleeps.
