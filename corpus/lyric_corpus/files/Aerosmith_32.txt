lord i must be dreaming.
what else could this be.
everybodys screaming.
running for the sea.
holy lands are sinking.
birds take to the sky.
the prophets are all stinking drunk.
i know the reason why.
eyes are full of desire.
mind is so ill at ease.
everything is on fire.
shit piled up to the knees.
out of rhyme or reason.
everyones to blame.
children of the season.
do not be lame.
sorry.
you are so sorry.
do not be sorry.
man has known and now hes blown it.
upside down and hells the only sound.
we did an awful job and now they say its nobodys fault.
old saint andres.
seven years ago.
shove it up their richters.
redlines stop and go.
noblemen of courage.
listen with their ears.
spoke but how discouraging.
when no one really hears.
one of these days you will be sorry.
too many houses on the stilt.
three million years or just a story.
four on the floor up to the hilt.
out of rhyme or reason.
everyones to blame.
children of the season.
do not be lame.
sorry.
you are so sorry.
do not be sorry.
man has known and now hes blown it.
upside down and hells the only sound.
we did an awful job and now we are just a little too late.

eyes are full of desire.
mind is so ill at ease.
everything is on fire.
shit piled up in debris.
california showtime.
five oclocks the news.
everybodys concubine.
was prone to take a snooze.
sorry.
you are so sorry.
do not be sorry.
man has known and now hes blown it.
upside down and hells the only sound.
we did an awful job and now we are just a little too late.
