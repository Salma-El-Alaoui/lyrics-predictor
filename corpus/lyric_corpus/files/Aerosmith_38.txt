sweet emotion.
sweet emotion.

you talk about things and nobody cares.
you are wearing other things that nobody wears.
you are calling my name but i gotta make it clear.
i can not say baby where i will be in a year.

some sweat hod mama with a face like a gent.
said, my get up and go must have got up and went.
well i got good news, shes a real good liar.
cause the backstage boogie set your pants on fire.

sweet emotion.
sweet emotion.

i pulled into town in a police car.
your daddy said i took it just a little too far.
you telling me things but your girlfriend lied.
you can not catch me cause the rabbit done died.
yes it did.

you stand in the front just a shaking your ass.
i will take you backstage, you can drink from my glass.
i talk about something you can sure understand.
cause a month on the road and i will be eating from your hand.
