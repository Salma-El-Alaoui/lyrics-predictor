if i had a perfect day.
i would have it start this way.
open up the fridge and have a tall boy.
yeah.

then id meet up with my friends.
head out to the game again.
we do not even really care who wins.
hey, wins, hey, 123.

chorus.
now excitement seems to grow.
when we are hanging with the bros.
when we are chilling and we pound a case of strohs.
now the game is cool to see.
you can high 5 on tv.
count the riot on the one two three.
operation is in sight.
and the field is open wide.
when you break it then you know you are still alive.
if the cops do not make you pay.
and you make your getaway.
then you know.
thats one fine day.
hey.

on that day before we are through.
we could torch a car or two.
then have ourselves another tall boy.
yeah.

water hoses and batons.
thats the real game thats on.
i do not really give a shit who wins.
hey, wins, hey 123.

chorus.

i believe its my god given right.
to destroy everything in my sight.
cause it never gets dull, it never gets old.
the only thing it gets is more bold.
drinking, fighting, going to the game.
in our world its a way to stay sane.
if you are asking me.
to have it my way, id say thats.
one fine day.

chorus.
hey, hey, hey, hey.
