believe in me   send no money.
died on the cross, and that aingt funny.
but my so called friends they are making me a joke.
they missed out what i said like i never spoke.
they choose what they wanna hear   they do not tell a lie.
they just leave out the truth as they are watching you die.
saving your soul by taking your money.
flies around shit, bees around honey.

holy smoke, holy smoke, plenty bad preachers for.
the devil to stoke.
feed em in feet first this is no joke.
this is thirsty work making holy smoke.

jimmy reptile and all his friends.
say they gonna be with you at the end.
burning records, burning books.
holy soldiers, nazi looks.
crocodile smiles, just wait awhile.
till the tv queen gets her make up clean.
i have lived in filth, i have lived in sin.
and i still smell cleaner than the shit your in.

holy smoke, holy smoke, plenty bad preachers for.
the devil to stoke.
feed em in feet first this is no joke.
this is thirsty work making holy smoke.

they aingt religious but they aingt no fools.
when noah built his cadillac it was cool.
two by two they are still going down.
and the satellite circus just left town.
i think they are strange and when they are dead.
they can have a lincoln for their bed.
friend of the president   trick of the tail.
now they aingt got a prayer   100 years in jail.

holy smoke, holy smoke, plenty bad preachers for.
the devil to stoke.
feed em in feet first this is no joke.
this is thirsty work making holy smoke.
