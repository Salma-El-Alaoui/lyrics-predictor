theres a boy i know.
hes the one i dream of.
looks into my eyes.
takes me to the stars above.
oh i lose control.
ca not seem to get enough.
when i wake from dreaming.
tell me is it really love.

how will i know.
girl trust your feelings.
how will i know.
how will i know.
love can be deceiving.
how will i know.

chorus.
how will i know if he really loves me.
i say a prayer with every heart beat.
i fall in love whenever we meet.
i am asking you what you know about these things.
how will i know if hes thinking of me.
i try to phone but i am too shy   can not speak.
falling in love is so bitter sweet.
this love is strong why do i feel weak.

wish i had you near me now.
