hey you, yeah you.

sometimes i think this woman is kinda hot.
sometimes i think this woman is sometimes not.
puts me down, fool me around.
why she do it to me.
out for satisfaction.
any piece of action.
that aingt the way it should be.

she needs loving.
knows i am the man.
shes gotta see.
pours my beer.
licks my ear.
brings out the devil in me.
hell aingt a bad place to be.

spends my money.
drinks my booze.
stays out every night.
but i got to thinking, hey just a minute.
something aingt right.
all this disillusions and confusion.
make me wanna cry.
oh the shame you, playing your games.
telling me those lies.

do not mind her playing demon.
long as its with me.
if this is hell.
then you could say.
its heavenly.
hell aingt a bad place to be.

late at night.
turns down the light.
closes up on me.
opens my heart.
tears me apart.
brings out the devil in me.

hell aingt no bad place to be.
i said hell aingt no bad place to be.
hell aingt no bad place to be.
hell aingt no bad place to be.
