i will start this off without any words.
i got so high that i scratched till i bled.

i love myself better than you.
i know its wrong so what should i do?

the finest day that i ever had.
was when i learned to cry on command.

i love myself better than you.
i know its wrong so what should i do?
i am on a plain, i can not complain.
i am on a plain.

my mother died every night.
its safe to say, do not quote me on that.

i love myself better than you.
i know its wrong so what should i do?

the black sheep got blackmailed again.
forgot to put on the zip code.

i love myself better than you.
i know its wrong so what should i do?
i am on a plain, i can not complain.
i am on a plain.

somewhere i have heard this before.
in a dream my memory has stored.
as a defense, i am neutered and spayed.
what the hell am i trying to say?

it is now time to make it unclear.
to write off lines that do not make sense.

i love myself better than you.
i know its wrong so what should i do?

one more special message to go.
and then i am done, then i can go home.

i love myself better than you.
i know its wrong so what should i do?
i am on a plain, i can not complain.
i am on a plain, i can not complain.
i am on a plain, i can not complain.
i am on a plain, i can not complain..
