all the ladies if you feel me help me sing it out.

verse 1.
i cant believe i believed everything we had would last.
so young and naive of me to think she was from your past.
silly of me to dream of one day having your kids.
love is so blind.
it feels right whens its wrong.
i cant believe i fell for your schemes.
im smarter than that.
so dumb and naive to believe with me you are a changed man.
foolish of me to compete.
when you cheat with loose women.
it took me some to realize but now i moved on.
because i realized i got.

chorus.
me myself and i is all i got in the end is what i found out.
and there aingt no need to cry.
i took a vow from now on i am gon be my own best friend.
me myself and i is all i got in the end is what i found out.
and there aingt no need to cry.
i took a vow from now on i am gon be my won best friend.

verse 2.
so controlling.
you say you love me but you dont.
your family told me one day i would see it on my own.
next thing i know im dealing with your three kids in my home.
love is so blind.
it feels right when its wrong.
now that its over stopping calling me.
come pick up your clothes.
aingt no need to front like you are still with me.
all your homies know.
even your best friend tried to warned me on the low.
took me some time but now im strong.

chorus.
me myself and i is all i got in the end is what i found out.
and there aingt no need to cry.
i took a vow from now on i am gon be my own best friend.
me myself and i is all i got in the end is what i found out.
and there aingt no need to cry.
i took a vow from now on i am gon be my own best friend.

bridge.
now i got me myself and i.
i know that i will never disappoint myself.
i have cried a thousand times.
so many bad times spent with you.
but im about to make it through.
repeat 3x.
