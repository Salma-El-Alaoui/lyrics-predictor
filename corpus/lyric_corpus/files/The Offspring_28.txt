look at the crowd and tell me whether.
all are surrounded.
but none are together.
if you are awake.
look all around at.
all of the people.
still you are so alone.
so alone.
so alone.
so alone.
so alone.

yellingif i could make a suggestion.
without sounding preachy.
or begging the question.
melt with your minds.
melt with each other.
do not be surrounded.
do not be so alone.
so alone.
so alone.
so alone.

kill.
fuck off.
hate.
die.
