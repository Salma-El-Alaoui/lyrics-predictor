the last train is nearly due.
the underground is closing soon.
and in the dark deserted station.
restless in anticipation.
a man waits in the shadows.

his restless eyes leap and scratch.
at all that they can touch or catch.
hidden deep within his pocket.
safe within his silent socket.
he holds a coloured crayon.

now from the tunnels stony womb.
the carriage rides to meet the groom.
and opens wide in welcome doors.
but he hesitates, and withdraws.
deeper in the shadows.

and the train is gone suddenly.
on wheels clicking silently.
like a gently tapping litany.
and he holds his crayon rosary.
tighter in his hand.

now from his pocket quickly flashes.
the crayon, on the wall he slashes.
deep upon the advertising.
a single worded poem comprised of.
four letters.

and his heart is laughing, screaming, pounding.
the poem across the tracks rebounding.
shadowed by the exit light.
his legs take their ascending flight.
to seek the breast of darkness and be suckled by the night.
