i talk to you every now and then.
i never felt so alone again.
i stop to think at a wishing well.
my thoughts send me on a carousel.

here i am standing on my own.
not a motion from the telephone.
i know not a reason why.
solitudes a reason to die.

just you wait and see.
as school life is a.
it is a woken dream.
are not you feeling alone?

i guess its just another.
i guess its just another.
i guess its just another night alone.

now as i walk down the street.
i need a job just to sleep in sheets.
buying food every once in a while.
but not enough to purchase a smile.

a tank of gas is a treasure to me.
i know now that nothing is free.
i talk to you every now and then.
i never felt so alone again.

just you wait and see.
as school life is a.
it is a woken dream.
are not you feeling alone?

i guess its just another.
i guess its just another.
i guess its just another night alone.
