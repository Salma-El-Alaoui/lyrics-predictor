o little town of bethlehem.
how still we see thee lie.
above thy deep and dreamless sleep.
the silent stars go by.
yet in thy dark streets shineth.
the everlasting light.
the hopes and fears of all the years.
are met in thee tonight.


the angels voices singing.
proclaim the early morning!
and children pure and happy.
a wait the break of dawn.
while charity stands watching.
and faithfuls wipe the door.
the dark night wakes the glory bricks.
and christmas comes once more.
