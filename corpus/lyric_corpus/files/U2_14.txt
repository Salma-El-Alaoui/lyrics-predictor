i have climbed the highest mountains.
i have run through the fields.
only to be with you.
only to be with you.

i have run, i have crawled.
i have scaled these city walls.
these city walls.
only to be with you.

but i still have not found.
what i am looking for.
but i still have not found.
what i am looking for.

i have kissed honey lips.
felt the healing in her finger tips.
it burned like fire.
i was burning inside her.

i have spoke with the tongue of angels.
i have held the hand of a devil.
it was warm in the night.
i was cold as a stone.

but i still have not found.
what i am looking for.
but i still have not found.
what i am looking for.

i believe in the kingdom come.
then all the colours will bleed into one.
bleed into one.
but yes, i am still running.

you broke the bonds.
and you loosed the chains.
carried the cross of my shame.
oh my shame, you know i believe it.

but i still have not found.
what i am looking for.
but i still have not found.
what i am looking for.

but i still have not found.
what i am looking for.
but i still have not found.
what i am looking for..
