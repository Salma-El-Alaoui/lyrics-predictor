got a sing song, man it goes like this.

somewhere the time was right, could have been gone in ten.
this world is hard to fight, hitting you once, hit it again.
to know the way it feels, everyone gets knocked down.
when you get up its real, taking it back, turn it around.

get on it, up on it.
get on it, would not wanna be you.
get on it, out on it.
get on it, no ones gonna free you.
you know, when you are keeping it slow.
no matter where you wanna go, would not wanna be you.
get on it, up on it.
its on, we are living in chaos.

somewhere along the line, things get chipped away.
this place keeps going down, gets a little worse every day.
i see hate and greed, this worlds a messed up town.
embrace the pain and see, taking it back, turn it around.

get on it, up on it.
get on it, would not wanna be you.
get on it, out on it.
get on it, no ones gonna free you.
you know, when you are keeping it slow.
no matter where you wanna go, would not wanna be you.
get on it, up on it.
its on.

x4 falling!
x4ya, ya, ya, ya.
