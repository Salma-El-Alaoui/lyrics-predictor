do the worm on acropolis.
slamdance the cosmopolis.
enlighteen the populace.

hungry darkness of living.
who will thirst in the pit.
hooked in metropolis.
she spent a lifetime deciding.
how to run from it.
addicts of metropolis.
once fate had a witness.
and the years seemed like friends.
girlfriend.
her babies can dream.
but dreams begin like the end.
shot into eternity.
methadone kitty.
iron serenity.

ghetto defendant.
it is heroin pity.
not tear gas nor baton charge.
that stops you taking the city.
strung out committee.

walled out of the city.
clubbed down from uptown.
sprayed pest from the nest.
run out to barrio town.
the guards are itchy.
forced to watch at the feast.
then sweep up the night.
flipped pieces of coin.
broken bottles.
exchanged for birthright.
graphed in a jiffy.
strung out committee.
sitting pretty.
graphed in a jiffy.
no pity, pretty.

the ghetto prince of gutter poets.
was bounced out of the room.
jean arthur rimbaud.
by the bodyguards of greed.
for disturbing the tomb.
1873.
his words like flamthrowers.
paris commune.
burnt the ghettos in their chests.
his face painted whiter.
and he was laid to rest.
died in marseille.
buried in charleville.
shut up.

soap floods oil in water.
all churn in the wake.
on the great ship of progress.
the crew can not find the brake.
klaxons are blaring.
the admiral snores command.
submarines boil in oceans.
while the armies fight with suns.
