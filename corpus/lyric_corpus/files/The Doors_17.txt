carry me, caravan.
take me away.
take me to portugal.
take me to spain.
andalucia.
with fields full of grain.
i have to see you.
again and again.
take me, spanish caravan.
yes, i know you can.

trade winds find galleons.
lost in the sea.
i know where treasure.
is waiting for me.
silver and gold.
in the mountains of spain.
i have to see you.
again and again.
take me, spanish caravan.
yes, i know you can..
