another day has gone.
i am still all alone.
how could this be?
you are not here with me.
you never said goodbye.
someone tell me why.
did you have to go.
and leave my world so cold?

everyday i sit and ask myself.
how did love slip away.
something whispers in my ear and says.
that you are not alone.
for i am here with you.
though you are far away.
i am here to stay.

you are not alone.
i am here with you.
though we are far apart.
you are always in my heart.
you are not alone.

all alone.
why, oh.

just the other night.
i thought i heard you cry.
asking me to come.
and hold you in my arms.
i can hear your prayers.
your burdens i will bear.
but first i need your hand.
so forever can begin.

everyday i sit and ask myself.
how did love slip away.
then something whispers in my ear and says.
that you are not alone.
for i am here with you.
though you are far away.
i am here to stay.
for you are not alone.
i am here with you.
though we are far apart.
you are always in my heart.
and you are not alone.

oh, whisper three words and i will come running.
fly...
and girl you know that i will be there.
i will be there!

you are not alone.
i am here with you.
though you are far away.
i am here to stay.
you are not alone.
i am here with you.
though we are far apart.
you are always in my heart.

you are not alone.
for i am here with you.
though you are far away.
i am here to stay.
for you are not alone.
for i am here with you.
though we are far apart.
you are always in my heart.

you just reach for me baby.
in the morning in the evening.
you are not alone, not alone.
you and me, not alone, oh, together, together....
