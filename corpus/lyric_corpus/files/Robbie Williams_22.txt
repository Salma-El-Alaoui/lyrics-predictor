we have got stars directing our fate.
and we are praying its not too late.
millennium.

some say that we are players.
some say that we are pawns.
but we have been making money since the day that we were born.
got to slow downslow down.
cause we are low down.

run around in circles.
live a life of solitude.
till we find ourselves a partner.
someone to relate to.
then we will slow down, before we fall down.

we have got stars directing our fate.
and we are praying its not too late.
cause we know we are falling from grace.
millennium.

live for liposuction, detox for your rent.
overdose for christmas and give it up for lent.
my friends are all so cynical.
refuse to keep the faith.
we all enjoy the madness.
cause we know we are gonna fade away.

we have got stars directing our fate.
and we are praying its not too late.
cause we know we are falling from grace.
millennium.

come and have a go.
if you think you are hard enough.
come and have a go.
if you think you are hard enough.
millennium.
millennium.

we have got stars directing our fate.
and we are praying its not too late.
cause we know we are falling from grace.
millennium.

sometimes you know.

and when we come we always come too late.
i often think that we were born to hate.
get up and see the sarcasm in my eyes.

and when we come we always come too late.
