i might be wrong.
i might be wrong.
i could have sworn i saw a light coming on.

i used to think.
i used to think.
there was no future left at all.
i used to think.

open up, begin again.
lets go down the waterfall.
think about the good times and never look back.
never look back.

what would i do?
what would i do?
if i did not have you.

open up, let me in.
lets go down the waterfall.
have ourselves a good time, its nothing at all.
its nothing at all.
nothing at all.

never look back.
never look back.
