you are far, when i could have been your star.
you listened to people.
who scared you to death, and from my heart.
strange that you were strong enough.
to even make a start.
but you will never find peace of mind.
till you listen to your heart.

people, you can never change the way they feel.
better let them do just what they will.
for they will, if you let them.
steal your heart from you.
people,will always make a lover feel a fool.
but you knew i loved you.
we could have shown them all.
we should have seen love through.

fooled me with the tears in your eyes.
covered me with kisses and lies.
so good bye, but please do not take my heart.

you are far, i am never gonna be your star.
i will pick up the pieces and mend my heart.
maybe i will be strong enough, i do not know where to start.
but i will never find peace of mind, while i listen to my heart.
people, you can never change the way they feel.
better let them do just what they will.
for they will, if you let them, steal your heart.

and people, will always make a lover feel a fool.
but you knew i loved you.
we could have shown them all.
we should have seen love through.

but remember this, every other kiss.
that you ever give, long as we both live.
when you need the hand of another man.
one you really can surrender with.
i will wait for you, like i always do.
theres something there, that can not compare.
with any other.

you are far.
when i could have been your star.
you listened to people.
who scared you to death, and from my heart.
strange that i was wrong enough.
to think youd love me too.
i guess you were kissing a fool.

you must have been kissing a fool.
