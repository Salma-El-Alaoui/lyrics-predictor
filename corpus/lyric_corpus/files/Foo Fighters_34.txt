coming down, i am coming round.
this time i think i am waking up.
give me loud to drown it out.
before the world starts breaking up.
you change and then, you change again.
turning like a wheel inside your head.
yours and mine and left and right.
theres still two sides to everyone.
you and i get on with life.
and pray we will find a better one.
you change and then, you change again.
turning like a wheel inside your head.

chorus.
overdrive, we are going life or death x3.
two strangers on the mend.
overdrive, we are going life or death x2.

hurry now we are getting out.
this time theres nothing stopping us.
leave behind this vacant town.
tonight, and let it turn to rust.
you change and then, you change again.
turning like a wheel inside your head.

overdrive, we are going life or death x3.
two strangers, no relation, on the mend.
you change and then, you change again.
turning like a wheel inside your head.

coming down, i am coming round.
this time i think i am waking up.
give me loud to drown it out.
before the world starts breaking up.
you change and then, you change again.
turning like a wheel inside your head.

chorus.
overdrive, we are going life or death x3.
two strangers on the...
overdrive, we are going life or death x5.
two strangers, no relation x2.
on the mend.
