got me the strangest woman.
believe me this tricks no cinch.
but i really get her going.
when i whip out my big ten inch.

record of a band that plays the blues.
well a band that plays its blues.
she just love my big ten inch.
record of her favorite blues.

last night i tried to tease her.
i gave my love a little pinch.
she said now stop that jiving.
now whip out your big ten inch.

record of a band that plays the blues.
well a band that plays the blues.
she just loves my big ten inch.
record of her favorite blues.

i, i, i cover her with kisses.
and when we are in a lovers clinch.
she gets all excited.
when she begs for my big ten inch.

record of a band that plays the blues.
well a band that plays the blues.
she just love my big ten inch.
record of her favorite blues.

my girl do not go for smoking.
and liquor just make her flinch.
seem she will go for nothing.
cept for my big ten inch.

record of a band that plays the blues.
band that play the blues.
she just love my big ten inch.
record of her favorite blues.
