this is the life, this is the life.
a simple fear to wash you away.
this is the life, this is the life.
an open mind canceled it today.

this is the life, this is the life.
a silent song thats in your words.
this is the life, this is the life.
a different taste thats in your mind.

this is the life on mars.
this is the life on mars.
