heres a tale of tom.
who worked the railroads long.
his wife would cook his meal.
as he would change the wheel.

poor tom, seventh son, always knew whats goin on.
aingt a thing that you can hide from tom.
there aingt nothing that you can hide from tom.

worked for thirty years.
sharing hopes and fears.
dreaming of the day.
he could turn and say.

poor tom, works done, been lazing out in the noonday sun.

aingt a thing that you can hide from tom.

his wife was annie mae.
with any man a game shed play.
when tom was out of town.
she could not keep her dress down.

poor tom, seventh son, always knew whats goin on.

aingt a thing that you can hide from tom.

and so it was one day.
people got to annie mae ?
tom stood, a gun in his hand.
and stopped her running around.

poor tom, seventh son, gotta die for what you have done.

all those years of work are thrown away.
to ease your mind is that all you can say?

but what about that grandson on your knee?
them railroad songs, tom would sing to me.

aingt nothing that you can hide from tom.

keep a trucking.
