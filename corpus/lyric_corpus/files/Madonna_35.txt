things have not been the same.
since you came into my life.
you found a way to touch my soul.
and i am never, ever, ever gonna let it go.

bridge.

happiness lies in your own hand.
it took me much too long to understand.
how it could be.
until you shared your secret with me.

chorus.

mmm mmm skip for the first two times.
somethings coming over, mmm mmm.
somethings coming over, mmm mmm.
somethings coming over me.
my babys got a secret.

you gave me back the paradise.
that i thought i lost for good.
you helped me find the reasons why.
it took me by surprise that you understood.
you knew all along.
what i never wanted to say.
until i learned to love myself.
i was never ever loving anybody else.

bridge.
chorus, repeat.
bridge.
chorus, repeat.

mmm mmm, my babys got a secret.
mmm mmm, my babys got a secret.
mmm mmm, my babys got a secret for me.

mmm mmm, mmm mmm, mmm mmm.
