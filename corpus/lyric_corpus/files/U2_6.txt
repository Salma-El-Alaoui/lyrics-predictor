boy girl, boy girl.
when a boy meets a girl.
boy girl.

finding out.
i am finding out the things.
that i have been talking about.
i am finding all the things.
that i have been missing out.
finding all the things.
i lose my mind.
sometimes fall behind.

you and i we live on the big ship.
and time goes by.
you make up and i believe a ladys lie.
the skinheads call it strawberries and cream.
sometimes i scream.

boy girl, boy girl.
when a boy meets a girl.
boy girl.

we go out.


a picture or a disco or a roundabout.
i walk you home, i hold you there.
you are giving out.
i open doors so i can shut your face.
know your place.

boy girl, boy girl.
when a boy meets a girl.
boy girl.

you can take me in your hand.
stand back, leave me, come in.
up and down and all around.
you will sideways to the ground.

boy girl, boy girl.
when a boy meets a girl.
repeat until end.
