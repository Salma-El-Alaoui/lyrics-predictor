shadows falling , baby , we stand alone.
out on the street anybody you meet got a heartache of their own.
it oughta be illegal.
make it a crime to be lonely or sad.
it oughta be illegal.
you got a reason for living.
you battle on with the love you are living on.
you gotta be mine.
we take it away.
its gotta be night and say.
just a matter of time.
and we got nothing to be guilty of.
our love will climb any mountain near or far , we are.
and we never let it end.
we are devotion.
and we got nothing to be sorry for.
our love is one in a million.
eyes can see that we got a highway to the sky.
i do not wanna hear your goodbye.
oh!
barry.
aaah!
pulses racing , darling.
how grand we are.
little by little we meet in the middle.
theres danger in the dark.
it oughta be illegal.
make it a crime to be out in the cold.
it oughta be illegal.
you got a reason for living.
you battle on with the love you are building on.
together.
you gotta be mine.
we take it away.
its gotta be night and day.
just a matter of time.
and we got nothing to be guilty of.
our love will climb and mountain near or far , we are.
and we never let it end.
we are devotion.
and we got nothing to be sorry for.
our love is one in a million.
eyes can see that we got a highway to the sky.
barbra.
i do not wanna hear your goodbye.
barry.
do not wanna hear your goodbye.
together.
i do not wanna hear your.
and we got nothing to be guilty of.
our love will climb and mountain near or far , we are.
and we never let it end.
we are devotion.
and we got nothing to be sorry for.
our love is one in a million.
eyes can see that we got a highway to the sky.
do not wanna hear your goodbye.
do not wanna hear your.
and we got nothing to be guilty of....
