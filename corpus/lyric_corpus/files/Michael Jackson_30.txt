i was wandering in the rain.
mask of life, feeling insane.
swift and sudden fall from grace.
sunny days seem far away.
kremlings shadow belittling me.
stalings tomb will not let me be.
on and on and on it came.
wish the rain would just let me.

how does it feel how does it feel.
how does it feel.
how does it feel.
when you are alone.
and you are cold inside.

here abandoned in my fame.
armageddon of the brain.
kgb was stalkin me.
take my name and just let me be.
then a begger boy called my name.
happy days will drown the pain.
on and on and on it came.
and again, and again, and again...
take my name and just let me be.

how does it feel how does it feel.
how does it feel.
how does it feel.
how does it feel.
how does it feel how does it feel now.
how does it feel.
how does it feel.
when you are alone.
and you are cold inside.

how does it feel how does it feel.
how does it feel.
how does it feel.
how does it feel.
how does it feel how does it feel now.
how does it feel.
how does it feel.
when you are alone.
and you are cold inside.
