and here we go for the hundredth time.
hand grenade pins in every line.
throw em up and let something shine.
going out of my fucking mind.
filthy mouth, no excuse.
find a new place to hang this noose.
string me up from atop these roofs.
knot it tight so i will not get loose.
truth is you can stop and stare.
run myself out, and no one cares.
dug the trench out, laid down there.
with a shovel up out of reach somewhere.
yeah, someone pour it in.
make it a dirt dance floor again.
say your prayers and stomp it out.
when they bring that chorus in.

i bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away.
i bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away.
i bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away.
just to throw it away, just to throw it away.

i bleed it out, go, stop the show.
choppy words and a sloppy flow.
shotgun opera, lock and load.
cock it back and then watch it go.
mama help me, i have been cursed.
death is rolling in every verse.
candy paint on his brand new hearse.
ca not contain him, he knows he works.
... this hurts, i will not lie.
does not matter how hard i try.
half the words do not mean a thing.
and i know that i will not be satisfied.
so why try ignoring him?
make it a dirt dance floor again.
say your prayers and stomp it out.
when they bring that chorus in.

i bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away.
i bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away.
i bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away.
just to throw it away, just to throw it away.
i bleed it out, i have opened up these scars.
i will make you face this.
i pull myself so far.
i will make you face, this, now.

i bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away.
i bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away.
i bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away.
just to throw it away, just to throw it away.

i bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away.
i bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away.
i bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away.
just to throw it away, just to throw it away.

i bleed it out.
i bleed it out.
i bleed it out..
