back to the cold restless streets at night.
talk to myself about tomorrow night.
walls of white protest.
a gravestone in name.
who is it now?
its always the same.

who is it now? who calls me inside?
are the leaves on the trees just a living disguise?
i walk the street rain tragicomedy.
i will walk home again to the street melody.

but i know, oh no.
but i know, oh no.
but i know.

shadows and tall trees.
shadows and tall trees.
shadows and tall trees.
shadows and tall trees.

life through a window.
discoloured pain.
mrs browns washing is always the same.
i walk the street rain tragicomedy.
i will walk home again to the street melody.

but i know, oh no.
but i know, oh no.
but i know.

do you feel in me.
anything redeeming.
any worthwhile feeling?
is love like a tightrope.
hanging on my ceiling?

but i know, oh no.
but i know, oh no.
but i know.

shadows and tall trees.
shadows and tall trees.
shadows and tall trees.
shadows and tall trees.

shadows, shadows, shadows.
shadows, shadows, shadows.
shadows and tall trees.

shadows, shadows, shadows.
shadows, shadows, shadows.
shadows and tall trees..
