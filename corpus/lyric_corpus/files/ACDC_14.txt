living easy, loving free.
season ticket on a one way ride.
asking nothing, leave me be.
taking everything in my stride.

aingt nothing that id rather do.
going down, party time.

no stop signs, speed limit.
nobodys gonna slow me down.
like a wheel, gonna spin it.
nobodys gonna mess me around.
hey satan, paid my dues.
playing in a rocking band.
hey momma, look at me.
i am on my way to the promised land.

i am on the highway to hell.
highway to hell.
