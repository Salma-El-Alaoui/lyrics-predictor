i wish i could look in your eyes.
and tell you how i feel.
right now inside.
baby i know that its real.
so real so real, so real.
how i wish i could be with you.
how i wish i wish i wish i could be with you right now.

every morning, every afternoon, every night.
i wanna be with you.
it do not matter if we go to the park or watch a play.
stay in the hotel room all day.
i just wanna be with you.
i love everything about you.
from your old school tennis shoes.
to the way you move when you are dancing with me.

do you remember our first kiss.
it was not long enough.
remember the first time.
we spent those weeks together.
they were not long enough.
all of our conversations.
all of your sweet pages.
they are never long enough.

when its time for me to leave.
its so hard to say good bye.
i never want to say good bye.
i never ever want to say good bye.

one day we will make love.
finally i will be yours.
only you only you.
i could love you.
its too late.
i already love you.
i love you.
i love you.
i love you.
