i hear a gang fire on a human factory farm.
are they howling out or doing somebody harm.
on a catwalk jungle somebody grabbed my arm.
a voice spoke so cold it matched the weapon in her palm.

this is england.
this knife of sheffield steel.
this is england.
this is how we feel.

time on his hands freezing in those clothes.
he will not go for the carrot.
they beat him by the pole.
some sunny day confronted by his soul.
hes out at sea, too far off, he can not go home.

this is england.
what we are supposed to die for.
this is england.
and we are never gonna cry no more.

black shadow of the vincent.
falls on a triumph line.
i got my motorcycle jacket.
but i am walking all the time.
south atlantic wind blows.
ice from a dying creed.
i see no glory.
when will we be free.

this is england.
we can chain you to the rail.
this is england.
we can kill you in a jail.

the british boots go kick them.
got em in the head.
police aingt watching.
the newspapers been read.
who cares to protest.
a ??? in the eye like a flare.
out came the batons and.
the british warned themselves.

this is england.
the land of illegal dances.
this is england.
land of a thousand stances.
this is england.
this knife of sheffield steel.
this is england.
this is how we feel.
this is england.
this is england.
