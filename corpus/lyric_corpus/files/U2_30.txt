i am not afraid of anything in this world.
theres nothing you can throw at me that i have not already heard.
i am just trying to find a decent melody.
a song that i can sing in my own company.

i never thought you were a fool.
but darling, look at you.
you gotta stand up straight, carry your own weight.
these tears are going nowhere, baby.

you have got to get yourself together.
you have got stuck in a moment and now you can not get out of it.
do not say that later will be better.
now you are stuck in a moment.
and you can not get out of it.

i will not forsake the colours that you bring.
the nights you filled with fireworks.
they left you with nothing.
i am still enchanted by the light you brought to me.
i listen through your ears, and through your eyes i can see.

and you are such a fool.
to worry like you do.
i know its tough, and you can never get enough.
of what you do not really need now... my oh my.

you have got to get yourself together.
you have got stuck in a moment and you can not get out of it.
oh, love, look at you now.
you got yourself stuck in a moment and you can not get out of it.

i was unconscious, half asleep.
the water is warm till you discover how deep.
i was not jumping for me it was a fall.
its a long way down to nothing at all.

you have got to get yourself together.
you have got stuck in a moment and now you can not get out of it.
do not say that later will be better.
now you are stuck in a moment and you can not get out of it.

and if the night runs over.
and if the day will not last.
and if our way should falter.
along this stony pass.

and if the night runs over.
and if the day will not last.
and if your way should falter.
along this stony pass.
its just a moment.
this time will pass.
