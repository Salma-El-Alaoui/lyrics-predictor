why can not you see.
that i am still mad about you.
even though i have found out about you.
i will always stay forever true.

and in my heart.
i will forgive you.
i have got so much love to give you.

chorus.
its never too late.
we have still got time.
its never too late.
you can still be mine.
its never too late.
to change your mind.

why can not you try.
and be a man about it.
and if you stop and think about it.
you just can not keep walking out on me.
and even if it takes forever.
your loves better late than never.

chorus.

its never too late.
its never too late.
its never too late.
to change your mind.

though i try.
i can never put you from my mind.
you just creep right back inside.
and theres no place i can hide.

and in my heart.
i will forgive you.
i have got so much love to give you.

chorus.
repeat  fade.
