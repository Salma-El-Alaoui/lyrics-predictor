sometimes i need to remember just to breathe.
sometimes i need you to stay away from me.
sometimes i am in disbelief i did not know.
somehow i need you to go.

do not stay.
forget our memories.
forget our possibilities.
what you were changing me into.
just give me myself back and do not stay.
forget our memories.
forget our possibilities.
take all your faithlessness with you.
just give me myself back and do not stay.

sometimes i feel like i have trusted you too well.
sometimes i just feel like screaming at myself.
sometimes i am in disbelief i did not know.
somehow i need to be alone.

do not stay.
forget our memories.
forget our possibilities.
what you were changing me into.
just give me myself back and do not stay.
forget our memories.
forget our possibilities.
take all your faithlessness with you.
just give me myself back and do not stay.

i do not need you anymore.
i do not want to be ignored.
i do not need one more day.
of you wasting me away.
i do not need you anymore.
i do not want to be ignored.
i do not need one more day.
of you wasting me away.
with no apologies.

do not stay.
forget our memories.
forget our possibilities.
what you were changing me into.
just give me myself back and do not stay.
forget our memories.
forget our possibilities.
take all your faithlessness with you.
just give me myself back and do not stay.
do not stay.
do not stay.
