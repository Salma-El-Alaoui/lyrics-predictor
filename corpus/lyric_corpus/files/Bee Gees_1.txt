i was a midnight rider on a cloud of smoke.
i could make a woman hang on every single stroke.
i was an iron man.
i had a master plan.
but i was alone.

i could hear you breathing.
with a sigh of the wind.
i remember how your body started trembling.
oh, what a night its been.
and for the state i am in.
i am still alone.

and all the wonders made for the earth.
and all the hearts in all creation.
somehow i always end up alone.
always end up alone.

so i play, i will wait.
cause you know that love takes time.
we came so far.
just the beat of a lonely heart.
and its mine.
i do not want to be alone.

well, since i got no message on your answer phone.
and since you are busy every minute.
i just stay at home.
i make believe you care.
i feel you everywhere.
but i am still alone.

i am on a wheel of fortune with a twist of fate.
cause i know it is not heaven, is it love or hate.
am i the subject of the pain.
an i the stranger in the rain.
i am alone.

and if there glory there to behold.
maybe its my imagination.
another story there to be told.

so i play, i will wait.
and i pray its not too late.
we came so far.
just a beat of a lonely heart.
and its mine.
i do not want to be alone.

and all the wonders made for the earth.
and all the hearts in all creation.
another story there to be told.

so i play, i will wait.
and i pray its not too late.
we came so far.
just a beat of a lonely heart.
and its mine.
i do not want to be alone.

gone, but not out of sight.
i am caught in the rain and theres no one home.
face the heat of the night.
the one that you loves got a heart thats made of stone.

shine and search for the light.
and sooner or later you will be cruising on your ocean.

and clean out of sight.
i am caught in the rain and theres no one home.
