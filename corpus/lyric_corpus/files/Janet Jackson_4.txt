chorus 2x.
i get so lonely.
ca not let just anybody hold me.
you are the one that lives in me, my dear.
want no one but you.

sittin here with my tears.
all alone with my fears.
i am wonderin if i have to do.
withoutcha.
but theres no reason why.

i feel asleep late last night.
cryin like a newborn child.
holdin myself close.
pretendin my arms are yours.
i want no one but you.

chorus 2x.

i still remember to the day.
in fact is was a 3rd monday.
you came along to be the one for me.
now i am alone.

sittin here by the phone.
call and say that you are okay.
so that i will have the chance.
to beg you to stay.
i want no one but you.

chorus 4x.

gonna break it down.
break it down, break it down.
gotta break it down.
break it down, break it down.

that i know.
that i get so lonely thinking of you.
