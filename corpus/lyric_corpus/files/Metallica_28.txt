off through the new days mist i run.
out from the new days mist i have come.
i hunt.
therefore i am.
harvest the land.
taking of the fallen lamb.

off through the new days mist i run.
out from the new days mist i have come.
we shift.
pulsing with the earth.
company we keep.
roaming the land while you sleep.

shape shift nose to the wind.
shape shift feeling i have been.
move swift all senses clean.
earths gift back to the meaning of life.

bright is the moon high in starlight.
chill in the air cold as steel tonight.
we shift.
call of the wild.
fear in your eyes.
its later than you realized.

shape shift nose to the wind.
shape shift feeling i have been.
move swift all senses clean.
earths gift back to the meaning of life.

guitar  drum solo.

i feel a change.
back to a better day.
shape shifthair stands on the back of my neck.
shape shiftin wildness is the preservation of the world.

so seek the wolf in thyself.

shape shift nose to the wind.
shape shift feeling i have been.
move swift all senses clean.
earths gift back to the meaning...

of wolf, and man yeah.
