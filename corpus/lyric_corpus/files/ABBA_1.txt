take it easy with me, please.
touch me gently like a summer evening breeze.
take your time, make it slow.
andante, andante.
just let the feeling grow.

make your fingers soft and light.
let your body be the velvet of the night.
touch my soul, you know how.
andante, andante.
go slowly with me now.

i am your music.
i am your music and i am your song.
i am your song.
i am your music and i am your song.
play me time and time again and make me strong.
play me again cause you are making me strong.
make me sing, make me sound.
you make me sing and you make me...
andante, andante.
tread lightly on my ground.
andante, andante.
oh please do not let me down.

theres a shimmer in your eyes.
like the feeling of a thousand butterflies.
please do not talk, go on, play.
andante, andante.
and let me float away.

i am your music.
i am your music and i am your song.
i am your song.
i am your music and i am your song.
play me time and time again and make me strong.
play me again cause you are making me strong.
make me sing, make me sound.
you make me sing and you make me...
andante, andante.
tread lightly on my ground.
andante, andante.
oh please do not let me down.

make me sing, make me sound.
you make me sing and you make me...
andante, andante.
tread lightly on my ground.
andante, andante.
oh please do not let me down.
andante, andante.
oh please do not let me down....
