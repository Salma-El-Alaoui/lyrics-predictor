and when the day ends i am sure she feels sorrow.
the lonely guy i am i wait for her to change.
i have been here two days, i will sure be here tomorrow.
id eat her all if she were on my dinner plate.

and i wish.
i wish shed be more kind now.
i am out of luck cause the shades are pulled down.
i have seen everything there is to be shown.
i followed her all the way home.

i can not be too cool in a tree with my pants down.
the air is cold and i have got splinters in my feet.
she caught me once, but i do not think that she cares now.
unlike before, her view is now blocked by a leaf.

and i wish.
i wish shed be more kind now.
i am out of luck cause the shades are pulled down.
i have seen everything there is to be shown.
i followed her all the way home.

i bet this last time is the one time too many.
the rush of waiting is burning in my head.
right after supper her brother showers twice a week.
he kicks my ass so much, that filthy white inbred.

i have made mistakes by looking in the wrong window.
her dad is big and i have never seen his face.
i have been here two days, and i will sure be here tomorrow.
my ladys so sweet, she likes to entertain.

and i wish.
i wish shed be more kind now.
i am out of luck cause the shades are pulled down.
i have seen everything there is to be shown.
i followed her all the way home.

i bet this last times the one time too many.
the rush of waiting is burning through my head.
right after supper her brother showers twice a week.
he kicks my ass so much, that filthy white inbred.
