i have waited a long time for this.
it feels right now.
allow me to introduce myself.
i want you to come a little closer.
id like you to get to know me a little bit better.
meet the real me.

sorry you can not define me.
sorry i break the mold.
sorry that i speak my mind.
sorry do not do what i am told.
sorry if i do not fake it.
sorry i come too real.
i will never hide what i really feel.

huh, so here it is.
no hype, no gloss, no pretense.
just me.
stripped.
