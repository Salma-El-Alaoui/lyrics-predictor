oh, girl i have known you very well.
i have seen you growing everyday.
i never really looked before.
but now you take my breath away.

suddenly you are in my life.
part of everything i do.
you got me working day and night.
just trying to keep a hold on you.

here in your arms i found my paradise.
my only chance for happiness.
and if i lose you now i think i would die.

oh say you will always be my baby.
we can make it shine, we can take forever.
just a minute at a time.

more than a woman, more than a woman to me.
more than a woman, more than a woman to me.
more than a woman, oh, oh, oh.

there are stories old and true.
of people so in love like you and me.
and i can see myself.
let history repeat itself.

reflecting how i feel for you.
thinking about those people then.
i know that in a thousand years.
id fall in love with you again.

this is the only way that we should fly.
this is the only way to go.
and if i lose your love i know i would die.

oh say you will always be my baby.
we can make it shine, we can take forever.
just a minute at a time.

more than a woman, more than a woman to me.
more than a woman, more than a woman to me.
more than a woman, oh, oh, oh..
