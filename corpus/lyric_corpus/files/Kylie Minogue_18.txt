rain falling down.
another minute passes by.
i wait for you.
but this time i will not cry.
where are you now.
are you with another love.
its not the first time.
you stood me up and let me down.

chorus.
i, i i am wondering why.
i still love you.
je ne sais pas pourquoi.
i still want you.
je ne sais pas pourquoi.

lights about town.
expect me just to hang around.
and you never call.
you just stand me up and let me down.

chorus.

i, i i i.

all through the night.
i wanted you to come around.
i wait too long.
i know you are gonna let me down.

chorus.
repeat last 4 lines twice.
