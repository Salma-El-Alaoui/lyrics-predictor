i know your eyes in the morning sun.
i feel you touch me in the pouring rain.
and the moment that you wander far from me.
i wanna feel you in my arms again.
and you come to me on a summer breeze.
keep me warm in your love.
then you softly leave.

and its me you need to show.
how deep is your love?
i really need to learn.
cause we are living in a world of fools.
breaking us down.
when they all should let us be.
we belong to you and me.

i believe in you.
you know the door to my very soul.
you are the light in my deepest, darkest hour.
you are my savior when i fall.
and you may not think i care for you.
when you know down inside.
that i really do.

and its me you need to show.
how deep is your love?
i really need to learn.
cause we are living in a world of fools.
breaking us down.
when they all should let us be.
we belong to you and me.

and you come to me on a summer breeze.
keep me warm in your love.
then you softly leave.

and its me you need to show.
how deep is your love?
i really need to learn.
cause we are living in a world of fools.
breaking us down.
when they all should let us be.
we belong to you and me.
