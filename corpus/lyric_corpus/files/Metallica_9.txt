dealing out the agony within.
charging hard and no ones gonna give in.
living on your knees, conformity.
or dying on your feet for honesty.
inbred, our bodies work as one.
bloody, but never cry submission.
following our instinct not a trend.
go against the grain until the end.

chorus.
blood will follow blood.
dying time is here.
damage incorporated.
end chorus.

slamming through, do not fuck with razorback.
stepping out? you will feel our hell on your back.
blood follows blood and we make sure.
life aingt for you and we are the cure.
honesty is my only excuse.
try to rob us of it, but its no use.
steamroller action crushing all.
victim is your name and you shall fall.

chorus.

we chew and spit you out.
we laugh, you scream and shout.
all flee, with fear you run.
you will know just where we come from.

damage incorporated.

damage jackals ripping right through you.
sight and smell of this, it gets me going.
know just how to get just what we want.
tear it from your soul in nightly hunt.
fuck it all and fucking no regrets.
never happy ending on these dark sets.
alls fair for damage inc. you see.
step a little closer if you please.

chorus..
