well its a dog eat dog, eat cat too.
the french eat frog, and i eat you.
business man when you make a deal.
do you know who you can trust.
do you sign your life away.
do you write your name in dust.

hey, hey, hey.
every dog has its day.
its a dog eat dog, dog eat dog.

dog eat dog, read the news.
someone win, someone lose.
ups above and downs below.
and limbos in between.
up you win, down you lose.
its anybodys game.

hey, hey, hey.
every dog has its day.
its a dog eat dog, dog eat dog.

and its a eye for eye.
tooth for tooth.
its a lie.
thats the truth.
see the blind man on the street.
looking for something free.
hear the kind man ask his friend.
whats in it for me.

hey, hey, hey.
every dog has its day.
its a dog eat dog, dog eat dog.

dog eat dog, dog eat dog.
dog eat dog, dog eat dog.
dog eat dog, dog eat dog.
dog eat dog, dog eat dog....
