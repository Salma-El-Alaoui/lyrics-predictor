running circles in my head.
one of these days ill chase you down.

i dont wanna look like that.

you can see this on my face.
its all for you.
the more and more i take i break right through.
therapy still scares me.
putting me on my back again.
i may be crazy, little frayed around the ends.
one of these days ill phase you out.

burn it in the blast off.
burn it in the blast off.
watch me crawl away.
try to get out.
try to get out.

you know you make me breakout.
make me breakout.
