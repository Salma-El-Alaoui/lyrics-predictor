if i could stick my pen in my heart.
and spill it all over the stage.
would it satisfy ya, would it slide on by ya.
would ya think the boy is strange? aingt he strange?

if i could win ya, if i could sing ya.
a love song so divine.
would it be enough for your cheating heart.
if i broke down and cried? if i cried?

i said i know its only rock n roll but i like it.
i know its only rock n roll but i like it, like it, yes i do.
well, i like it, i like it, i like it.
i said can not you see that this old boy has been lonely?

if i could stick a knife in my heart.
suicide right on stage.
would it be enough for your teenage lust.
would it help to ease the pain? ease your brain?

if i could dig down deep in my heart.
feelings would flood on the page.
would it satisfy ya, would it slide on by ya.
would ya think the boys insane? hes insane?

i said i know its only rock n roll but i like it.
