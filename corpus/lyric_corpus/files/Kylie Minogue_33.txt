you do not remember me, but i remember you.
twas not so long ago, you broke my heart in two.
tears on my pillow, pain in my heart.
caused by you.

if we could start anew, i would not hesitate.
id gladly take you back, and tempt the hand of fate.
tears on my pillow, pain in my heart.
caused by you.

love is not a gadget, love is not a toy.
when you find the one you love.
she will fill your heart with joy.

if we could start anew, i would not hesitate.
id gladly take you back, and tempt the hand of fate.
tears on my pillow, pain in my heart.
caused by you.

tears on my pillow, pain in my heart.
caused by you.
caused by you.
caused by you.
caused by you.
