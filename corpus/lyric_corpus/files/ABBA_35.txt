you and i can share the silence.
finding comfort together.
the way old friends do.
and after fights and words of violence.
we make up with each other.
the way old friends do.
times of joy and times of sorrow.
we will always see it through.
oh i do not care what comes tomorrow.
we can face it together.
the way old friends do.
