lashing out the action, returning the reaction.
weak are ripped and torn away.
hypnotizing power, crushing all that cower.
battery is here to stay.

smashing through the boundries.
lunacy has found me.
cannot stop the battery.
pounding out aggression.
turns into obsession.
cannot kill the battery.
cannot kill the family.
battery is found in me.
battery.

crushing all deceivers, mashing non believers.
never ending potency.
hungry violence seeker, feeding off the weaker.
breeding on insanity.

smashing through the boundries.
lunacy has found me.
cannot stop the battery.
pounding out aggression.
turns into obsession.
cannot kill the battery.
cannot kill the family.
battery is found in me.
battery.

circle of destruction, hammer comes crushing.
powerhouse of energy.
whipping up a fury, dominating flurry.
we create the battery.

smashing through the boundries.
lunacy has found me.
cannot stop the battery.
pounding out aggression.
turns into obsession.
cannot kill the battery.
cannot kill the family.
battery is found in me.
battery.
