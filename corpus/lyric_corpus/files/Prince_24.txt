dig if you will the picture.
of you and i engaged in a kiss.
the sweat of your body covers me.
can you my darling...can you picture this?

dream if you can.
a courtyard.
an ocean of violets in bloom.
animals strike curious poses.
they feel the heat.
the heat between me and you.

chorus.
how can you just leave me standing?
alone in a world thats so cold.
maybe i am just too demanding.
maybe i am just like my father too bold.
maybe you are just like my mother.
shes never satisfied.
why do we scream at each other.
this is what it sounds like when doves cry.

touch if you will my stomach.
feel how it trembles inside.
you have got the butterflies all tied up.
do not make me chase you.
even doves have pride.

chorus.
how can you just leave me standing?
alone in a world so cold world so cold.
maybe i am just too demanding.
maybe i am just like my father too bold.
maybe you are just like my mother.
shes never satisfied.
why do we scream at each other.
this is what it sounds like when doves cry..
