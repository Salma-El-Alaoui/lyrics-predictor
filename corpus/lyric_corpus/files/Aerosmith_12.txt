every time that i look in the mirror.
all these lines in my face getting clearer.
the past is gone.
it went by like dusk to dawn.
is not that the way.
everybodys got their dues in life to pay, yeah.

i know nobody knows.
where it comes and where it goes.
i know its everybodys sin.
you got to lose to know how to win.

half my lifes in books written pages.
live and learn from fools and from sages.
you know its true.
all the things.
come back to you.

sing with me.
sing for the year.
sing for the laughter and sing for the tear.
sing it with me.
if its just for today.
maybe tomorrow the good lord will take you away.

dream on, dream on, dream on.
dream yourself a dream come true.
dream on, dream on, dream on.
dream until your dreams come true.

dream on, dream on, dream on, ahh.
