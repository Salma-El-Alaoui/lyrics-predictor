your defenses were on high.
your walls built deep inside.
yeah i am a selfish bastard.
but at least i am not alone.

my intentions never change.
what i want it stays the same.
and i know what i should do.
its time to set myself on fire.

was it a dream?
was it a dream?
is this the only evidence that proves it.
a photograph of you and i.

your reflection i have erased.
like a thousand burned out yesterdays.
believe me when i say, goodbye forever.
its for good.

was it a dream?
was it a dream?
is this the only evidence that proves it.
a photograph of you and i.

whoa yeah! whoa.

was it a dream?
was it a dream?
is this the only evidence that proves it.
a photograph of you and i.
a photograph of you and i.
was it a dream?
was it a dream?
is this the only evidence that proves it.
a photograph of you and i.
a photograph of you and i.
a photograph of you and i.

... in love....
