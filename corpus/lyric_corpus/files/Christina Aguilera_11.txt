i feel like.
i have been locked up tight.
for a century of lonely nights.
waiting for someone.
to release me.
you are licking your lips.
and blowing kisses my way.
but that do not mean.
i am gonna give it away.
baby baby baby baby baby baby...

ooohhh, my bodys saying lets go.
ooohhh, but my heart is saying no.

if you wanna be with me.
baby theres a price to pay.
i am a genie in a bottle.
you gotta rub me the right way.

if you wanna be with me.
i can make your wish come true!!
you gotta make a big impression.
gotta like what you do!!!!!!!!!!!!!

i am a genie in a bottle baby.
gotta rub me the right way honey.
i am a genie in a bottle baby.
come come, come and.
on and let me out.

the musics playing.
and the lights are low.
its one more dance.
and we are good to go.
waiting for someone who needs me.
hormones racing.
at the speed of a light.
but that do not mean.
its gotta be tonight.
baby baby baby baby baby baby...
ohhhhhhhhh.
ooohhh, my bodys saying lets go.
ooohhh, but my heart is saying no.

if you wanna be with me.
