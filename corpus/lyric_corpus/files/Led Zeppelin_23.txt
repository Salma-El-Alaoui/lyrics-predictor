its been a long time since i rock and rolled.
its been a long time since i did the stroll.
ooh, let me get it back, let me get it back, let me get it back.
baby, where i come from.
its been a long time, been a long time.
been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time, yes it has.

its been a long time since the book of love.
i can not count the tears of a life with no love.
carry me back, carry me back, carry me back.
baby, where i come from, whoa whoa whoa oh oh.
its been a long time, been a long time.
been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time.

oh, seems so long since we walked in the moonlight.
making vows that just can not work right.
ah yeah, open your arms, opens your arms, open your arms.
baby, let my love come running in, let it.
its been a long time, been a long time.
been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time.

its been a long time, been a long time.
been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time.
