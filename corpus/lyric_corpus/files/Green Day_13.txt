rargh!
i am on a mission.
i made my decision.
to lead a path of self destruction.
a slow progression.
killing my complexion.
and its rotting out my teeth.

i am on a roll.
no self control.
i am blowing off steam with.
meth amphetamine.
do not know what i want.
thats all that i have got.
and i am picking scabs off my face.
every hour my blood is turning sour.

and my pulse is beating out of time.

i found a treasure.
filled with sick pleasure.
and it sits on a thick white line.

i am on a roll.
no self control.
i am blowing off steam with.
meth amphetamine.
do not know what i want.
thats all that i have got.
and i am picking scabs off my face.

i am on a mission.
i got no decision like a cripple.
running the rat race.
wish in one hand and shit in the other.
and see which one gets filled first.

i am on a roll.
no self control.
i am blowing off steam with.
methamphetamine.
do not know what i want.
thats all that i have got.
and i am picking scabs off my face.

geek... stink... breath!
