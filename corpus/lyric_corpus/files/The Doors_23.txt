come on, come on.
now, touch me, babe.
ca not you see that i am not afraid.
what was that promise that you made.
why will not you tell me what she said.
what was that promise that you made.

now i am gonna love you.
til the heavens stop the rain.
i am gonna love you.
til the stars fall from the sky.
for you and i.
