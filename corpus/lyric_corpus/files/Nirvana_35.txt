like most babies smell like butter.
his smell smelled like no other.
he was born scentless and senseless.
he was born a scentless apprentice.

go away   get away, get a way.

every wet nurse refused to feed him.
electrolytes smell like semen.
i promise not to sell your perfumed secrets.
there are countless formulas for pressing flowers.

go away   get away, get a way.

i lie in the soll and fertilize mushrooms.
leaking out gas fumes are made into perfume.
you can not fire me because i quit!
throw me in the fire and i will not throw a fit.

go away   get away, get away, get away, get away, get away, get away, get a way.
