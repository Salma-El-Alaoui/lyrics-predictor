but i aingt wasting no more time.
cause i have got to make you mine.

chorus.
i am gonna make you want to.
get with me tonight.
i am gonna put those naughty.
thoughts into your mind.
i am gonna show you clearly.
i can rock your world.
you are gonna know for sure.
that i should be your girl.

see i used to be afraid.
but now baby i can not wait.
i just gotta have your love.
and enoughs enoughs enough.

chorus.
i am gonna make you want to.
get with me tonight.

thoughts into your mind.
i am gonna show you clearly.
i can rock your world.
you are gonna know for sure.
that i should be your girl.
