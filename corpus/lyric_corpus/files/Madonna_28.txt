when i was very young.
nothing really mattered to me.
but making myself happy.
i was the only one.

now that i am grown.
everythings changed.
i will never be the same.
because of you.

chorus.

nothing really matters.
love is all we need.
everything i give you.
all comes back to me.

looking at my life.
its very clear to me.
i lived so selfishly.
i was the only one.

i realize.
that nobody wins.
something is ending.
and something begins.

chorus, repeat.

nothing takes the past away.
like the future.
nothing makes the darkness go.
like the light.

you are shelter from the storm.
give me comfort in your arms.

chorus, repeat and fade.
