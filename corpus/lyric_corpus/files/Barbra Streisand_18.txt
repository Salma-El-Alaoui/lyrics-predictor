raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens.
bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens.
brown paper packages tied up with strings.
these are a few of my favorite things.
cream colored ponies and crisp apple strudels.
doorbells and sleighbells and schnitzel with noodles.
wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings.
these are a few of my favorite things.


girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes.
snow flakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes.
silver white winters that melt into springs.
these are a few of my favorite things.
when the dog bites, when the bee stings, when i am feeling sad.
i simply remember my favorite things.
like sliver white winters that melt into springs.
and then i do not feel so bad!
