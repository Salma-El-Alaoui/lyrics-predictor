come and i will take you under.
this beautiful bruises colors.
everything fades in time, its true.
wish that i had another.
stab at the undercover.
was it a change in mind for you.

its impossible.
i can not let it out.
you will never know.
am i selling you out.
sit and watch.
your every mood.
mood.

your eyes still remind me of.
angels that hover above.
eyes that can change from blind to blue.

its impossible.
i can not let it out.
you will never know.
am i selling you out.
sit and watch.
your every mood.
mood.
mood.
mood.

now that i have found my reward.
id throw it away long before.
id share a piece of mine with you.

its impossible.
i can not let it out.
you will never know.
am i selling you out.
sit and watch.
your every mood.
mood.
mood.
mood.
