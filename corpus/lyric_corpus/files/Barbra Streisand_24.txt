people.
people who need people.
are the luckiest people in the world.
we are children, needing other children.
and yet letting a grown up pride.
hide all the need inside.
acting more like children than children.
lovers are very special people.
they are the luckiest people in the world.
with one person one very special person.
a feeling deep in your soul.
says you were half now you are whole.
no more hunger and thirst.
but first be a person who needs people.
people who need people.
are the luckiest people in the world.
with one person one very special person.
no more hunger and thirst.
but first be a person who needs people.
people who need people.
are the luckiest people in the world....
