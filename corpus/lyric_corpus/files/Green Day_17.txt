hear the sound of the falling rain.
coming down like an armageddon flame hey!
the shame.
the ones who died without a name.

hear the dogs howling out of key.
to a hymn called faith and misery hey!
and bleed, the company that lost the war today.

i beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies.
this is the dawning of the rest of our lives.
on holiday!

hear the drum pounding out of time.
another protestor has crossed the line hey!
to find the moneys on the other side.

can i get another amen? amen!
theres a flag wrapped around a score of men hey!
a gag, a plastic bag on a monument.

i beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies.
this is the dawning of the rest of our lives.
on holiday!

i beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies.
