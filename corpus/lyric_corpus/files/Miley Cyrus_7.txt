do not call me, leave me alone.
 not gonna answer my phone.
 cuz i do not, no i will not see you.

i am out to have a good time.
 to get you off of my mind.
 cuz i do not, and i will not need you.

send out a 911.
 we are gonna have some fun.
 hey boy, you know you better run.

cuz its a girls night.
 its alright without you.
 i am gonna stay out.
 and play out without you.

you better hold tight.
 cuz girls nights without you.
 let us go gno, let us go gno.
 let us go gno, let us go.
 its a girls night.

i will dance with somebody new.
 do not have to think about you.
 and who knows what let go will lead to.

you will hear from everyone.
 you will get the 411.
 hey boy, you knew this day would come.

cuz its a girls night.
 its alright without you.
 i am gonna stay out.
 and play out without you.

let us go gno, let us go gno.
 let us go gno, let us go.

hey boy, do not you wish you.
 could have been a good boy.
 try to find another girl like me boy.
 feel me when i tell ya i am fine.
 and its time for me to draw the line, i said.

hey boy, do not you wish you.
 could have been a good boy.
 try to find another girl like me boy.
 feel me when i tell ya i am fine.
 and its time for me to draw the line.

cuz its a girls night.
 its alright without you.
 i am gonna stay out.
 and play out without you.

you better hold tight.
 cuz girls nights without you.
 let us go gno, let us go gno.
 let us go gno, let us go.
 its a girls night.
