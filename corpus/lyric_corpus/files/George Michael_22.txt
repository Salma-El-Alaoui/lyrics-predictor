you do not have to put on the red light.
those days are over.
you do not have to sell your body to the night.

you do not have to wear that dress tonight.
walk the streets for money.
you do not care if its wrong or if its right.

you do not have to put on the red light.

i loved you since i knew you.
i would not talk down to you.
i have to tell you just how i feel.
i will not share you with another boy.
i know my mind is made up.
so put away your make up.
told you once i will not tell you again.
its a bad way.

you do not have to put on the red light.

you do not have to put on the red light.
