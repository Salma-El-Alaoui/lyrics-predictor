what on earth am i meant to do.
in this crowded place there is only you.
was gonna leave.
now i have to stay.
you have taken my breath away.

ooh.
is the world still spinning around spinning around.
ooh.
i do not feel like coming down.

 chorus .
its in your eyes.
i can tell what you are thinking.
my heart is sinking too.
its no surprise.
i have been watching you lately.
i want to make it with you.

destiny has a funny way.
when it comes and takes all your cares away.
i can not think of a single thing.
other than what a beautiful state i am in.

ooh.
is the world still spinning around spinning around.
ooh.
i do not feel like coming down.

chorus.

ooh.
is the world still spinning around spinning around.
ooh.
i do not feel like coming down.

chorus x3.

its in your eyes.
