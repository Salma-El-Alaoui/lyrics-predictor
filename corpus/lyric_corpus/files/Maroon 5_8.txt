baby, i do not want to spend my life on trial.
for something that i did not do.
and maybe if you stopped and looked around some time.
i would not pass right by you.

maybe its because you are so insecure.
maybe you plain do not care.
maybe its the chase that really gets me off.
i fall so when its just not there.

burn another bridge, break another heart.
try again, it will only fall apart.

infatuation.
not seeing the rest of you is getting the best of me.
its such a shame that you shot me down.
it would have been nice to be around.
i am touching your skin.
if its only a fantasy, then why is it killing me?
i guess this must be infatuation.
i want it...x7.

try to put my finger on what burns me up.
it always seems to escape me.
and when you have decided that you have had enough.
just tell me where i need to be.

now i am facing something that i never had.
to ever deal with before.
she left me with the feeling that shed had enough.
and i am the one wanting more.

burn another bridge, break another heart.
try again, it will only fall apart.

i am so attracted to you.
the feelings mutual too.
and i get scared the moment you leave.
get so hot i forget to breathe, yeah.
