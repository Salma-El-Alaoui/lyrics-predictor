no life till leather.
we are gonna kick some ass tonight.
we got the metal madness.
when our fans start screaming.
its right well alright.
when we start to rock.
we never want to stop again.

hit the lights.
hit the lights.
hit the lights.

you know our fans are insane.
we are gonna blow this place away.
with volume higher.
than anything today the only way.
when we start to rock.
we never want to stop again.

hit the lights.
hit the lights.
hit the lights.

with all our screaming.
we are gonna rip right through your brain.
we got the lethal power.
it is causing you sweet pain oh sweet pain.
when we start to rock.
we never want to stop again.

hit the lights.
hit the lights.
hit the lights.
