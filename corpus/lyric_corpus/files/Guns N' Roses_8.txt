what we have got here is failure to communicate.
some men you just can not reach.
so, you get what we had here last week.
which is the way he wants it.
well, he gets it. i do not like it.
any more than you men.

look at your young men fighting.
look at your women crying.
look at your young men dying.
the way they have always done before.

look at the hate we are breeding.
look at the fear we are feeding.
look at the lives we are leading.
the way we have always done before.

my hands are tied.
the billions shift from side to side.
and the wars go on with brainwashed pride.
for the love of god and our human rights.
and all these things are swept aside.
by bloody hands time can not deny.
and are washed away by your genocide.
and history hides the lies of our civil wars.

did you wear a black armband.
when they shot the man.
who said peace could last forever.
and in my first memories.
they shot kennedy.
i went numb when i learned to see.
so i never fell for vietnam.
we got the wall of d.c. to remind us all.
that you can not trust freedom.
when its not in your hands.
when everybodys fighting.
for their promised land.

and.
i do not need your civil war.
it feeds the rich while it buries the poor.
your power hungry selling soldiers.
in a human grocery store.
aingt that fresh.
i do not need your civil war.

look at the shoes you are filling.
look at the blood we are spilling.
look at the world we are killing.
the way we have always done before.
look in the doubt we have wallowed.
look at the leaders we have followed.
look at the lies we have swallowed.
and i do not want to hear no more.

my hands are tied.
for all i have seen has changed my mind.
but still the wars go on as the years go by.
with no love of god or human rights.
cause all these dreams are swept aside.
by bloody hands of the hypnotized.
who carry the cross of homicide.
and history bears the scars of our civil wars.

we practice selective annihilation.
of mayors and government officials.
for example to create a vacuum.
then we fill that vacuum.
as popular war advances.
peace is closer.

i do not need your civil war.
it feeds the rich while it buries the poor.
your power hungry selling soldiers.
in a human grocery store.
aingt that fresh.
and i do not need your civil war.
i do not need your civil war.
i do not need your civil war.
your power hungry selling soldiers.
in a human grocery store.
aingt that fresh.
i do not need your civil war.
i do not need one more war.

i do not need one more war.
whats so civil bout war anyway.
