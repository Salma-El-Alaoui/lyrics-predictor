share my life.
take me for what i am.
cause i will never change.
all my colors for you.
take my love.
i will never ask for too much.
just all that you are.
and everything that you do.

i do not really need to look.
very much further.
i do not wanna have to go.
where you do not follow.
i will not hold it back again.
this passion inside.
ca not run from myself.
theres nowhere to hide.

chorus.
do not make me close one more door.
i do not wanna hurt anymore.
stay in my arms if you dare.
must i imagine you there?
do not walk away from me.
i have nothing.
nothing.
nothing, if i do not have you you oo, you oo, you.

right to the heart of me.
you break down my walls.
with the strength of your love mm..

will our memories survive?
uhh, one i can hold on to.

i do not really need to look.
very much further.
i do not wanna have to go.
where you do not follow.
i am holding back again.
this passion inside.
ca not run from myself.
theres nowhere to hide.
you are the love i remember forever.

do not make me close one more door.
i do not wanna hurt anymore.
stay in my arms if you dare.
must i imagine you there?
do not walk away from me.
i have nothing.

do not make me close one more door.
i do not wanna hurt anymore.
stay in my arms if you dare.
must i imagine you there?
