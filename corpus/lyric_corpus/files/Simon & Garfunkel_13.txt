when you are weary, feeling small.
when tears are in your eyes, i will dry them all.
i am on your side. when times get rough.
and friends just can not be found.
like a bridge over troubled water.
i will lay me down.
like a bridge over troubled water.
i will lay me down.

when you are down and out.
when you are on the street.
when evening falls so hard.
i will comfort you.
i will take your part.
when darkness comes.
and pain is all around.
like a bridge over troubled water.
i will lay me down.
like a bridge over troubled water.
i will lay me down.

sail on silvergirl.
sail on by.
your time has come to shine.
all your dreams are on their way.
see how they shine.
if you need a friend.
i am sailing right behind.
like a bridge over troubled water.
i will ease your mind.
like a bridge over troubled water.
i will ease your mind..
