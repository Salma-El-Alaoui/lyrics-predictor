hey you, are you in there.
i am stuck outside you.
we can use, one another.
another like you.

chorus.
you be my passer by.
i will be your new, one that passed through.
screws inside, turned so tight.
turning on you, i am hanging on you.

baby blue baby blue.
do not go nowhere do not go nowhere.
i am right beside you.
me and you me and you.
going nowhere going nowhere.
i am right beside you.

chorus.

taking you as low as you go.
as low as you go.
taking you as low as you go.
as low as you go.

chorus.

taking you as low as you go low as you go.
as low as you go low as you go.
taking you as low as you go low as you go.
as low as you go as low as you go.
low as you go, as low as you gox2.

taking you as low as you go low as you go.
as low as you go low as you go.
taking you as low as you go low as you go.
