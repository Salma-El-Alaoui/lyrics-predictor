first they ignore you.
then laugh at you and hate you.
then they fight you.
then you win.

when the truth dies very bad things happen.
they are being heartless again.
i know its gone and theres going to be violence.
i have taken as much as i am willing to take.
why do you think we should suffer in silence?
when a heart is broken theres nothing to break.

you have been mixing with some very heavy faces.
the boys have done a bit of bird.
they do not kill their own when they all love their mothers.
but you are out of your depth son have a word.

i know its gone and theres going to be violence.
i have taken as much as i am willing to take.
why do you think we should suffer in silence?
the heart is broken theres nothing to break.

all is wonderful in this life.
dreaming of the sun she warms.
you should see me in the afterlife.
picking up the sons of dust.

when you think we are lost we are exploring.
what you think is what you are soon adoring.
you do not want the truth the truth is boring.
i have got this fever, need to.
leave the house.
leave the car.
leave the bad men where they are.
i leave a few shells in my gun.
n its got me staring at the sun....

i know its gone and theres going to be violence.
i have taken as much as i am willing to take.
why do you say we should suffer in silence?
my heart is broken theres nothing to break.
