when your eyes say it.

i love to hear you say that you love me.
with words so sweet.
and i love the way with just one whisper.
you tell me everything.
and when you say those words.
its the sweetest thing i have ever heard.

chorus.
but when your eyes say it.
thats when i know that its true.
i feel it.
i feel the love coming through.
i know it.
i know that you truly care for me.
cause its there to see.
when your eyes say it.

i love all the ways that you show me.
you will never leave.
and the way your kisses, they always convince me.
your feelings run so deep.
i love the things you say.
and i love the love your touch conveys.
