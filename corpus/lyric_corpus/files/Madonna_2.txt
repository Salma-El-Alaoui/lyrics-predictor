a long, long time ago.
i can still remember.
how that music used to make me smile.
and i knew that if i had my chance.
i could make those people dance.
and maybe theyd be happy for a while.

did you write the book of love?
and do you have faith in god above.
if the bible tells you so?
now do you believe in rock n roll.
and can music save your mortal soul?
and can you teach me how to dance real slow?

well, i know that you are in love with him.
cause i saw you dancing in the gym.
you both kicked off your shoes.
man, i dig those rhythm and blues.

i was a lonely teenage broncing buck.
with a pink carnation and a pick up truck.
but i knew that i was out of luck.
the day the music died.
i started singing.

bye, bye, miss american pie.
drove my chevy to the levee.
but the levee was dry.
and good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye.
singing this will be the day that i die.
this will be the day that i die.

i met a girl who sang the blues.
and i asked her for some happy news.
but she just smiled and turned away.
when i went down to the sacred store.
where id heard the music years before.
but the man there said the music would not play.

well now, in the streets the children screamed.
the lovers cried, and the poets dreamed.
but not a word was spoken.
the church bells all were broken.

and the three men i admire the most.
the father, son and the holy ghost.
they caught the last train for the coast.
the day the music died.

we started singing.

bye, bye, miss american pie.
drove my chevy to the levee.
but the levee was dry.
and good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye.
singing this will be the day that i die.
this will be the day that i die.

bye, bye, miss american pie.

we started singing.
we started singing.
we started singing.
we started singing.
