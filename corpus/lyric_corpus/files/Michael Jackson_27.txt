he rocks in the tree tops all day long.
hopping and a bopping and singing his song.
all the little birdies on jaybird street.
love to hear the robin go tweet tweet tweet.
chorus .
rocking robin, rock rock.
rocking robing.
blow rocking robin.
cause we are really gonna rock tonight.

every little swallow, every chick a dee.
every little bird in the tall oak tree.
the wise old owl, the big black crow.
flapping their wings singing go bird go.

chorus.

pretty little raven at the bird band stand.
told them how to do the bop and it was grand.
they started going steady and bless my soul.
he out bopped the buzzard and the oriol.

he rocks in the tree tops all day long.
hopping and a bopping and singing his song.
all the little birdies on jaybird street.
love to hear the robin go tweet tweet tweet.

chorus.
