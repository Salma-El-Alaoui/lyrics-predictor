i have a choice between the bat and the belt.
each time i hear about the hand you have been dealt.
spare me confession, its confession you sell.
maybe i will fall behind but i do not mind because i will catch up.

i want a song thats indelible like manimal.
i hope you never see me wind up.

will i be happy on the back of the shelf.
will you be happy when we are sharing a cell.
spare me your questions since you know me so well.
someday you will realize that i get shy and i choke up.

i want a song thats indelible like manimal.
i hope you never see me wind up.
what is wrong with this animal, i am terrible.
i hope you never see me wind up.

farewell my sweet paramania.
repeat.

my only promise is that i will never tell.
keep you at a distance from the things that i felt.
i will bite the bullet, take the beating until.
i take it all back anyway, what was i supposed to say?

i want a song thats indelible like manimal.
i hope you never see me wind up.
what is wrong with this animal, i am terrible.
i hope you never see me wind up.
