life is a moment in space.
when the dream is gone.
its a lonelier place.

i kiss the morning goodbye.
but down inside.
you know we never know why.

the road is narrow and long.
when eyes meet eyes.
and the feeling is strong.

i turn away from the wall.
i stumble and fall.
but i give you it all.

i am a woman in love.
and i will do anything.

to get you into my world.
and hold you within.

its a right i will defend.
over and over again.
whatdo i do ?

with you eternally mine.
in love there is.
no measure of time.

we planned it all at the start.
that you and i.
live in each others hearts.

we may be oceans away.
you feel my love.
i hear what you say.

the truth is ever a lie.
i stumble and fall.
but i give you it all.

i am a woman in love.
and i will do anything.

to get you into my world.
and hold you within.

its a right i will defend.
over and over again.
whatdo i do ?

i am a woman in love.
and i am talking to you.

cause i know how you feel.
what a woman can do.

its a right i will defend.
over and over again.

i am a woman in love.
and i will do anything.

to get you into my world.
and hold you within.

its a right i will defend.
over and over again.

whatd i do ?
what do i do ?

whatd i do ?
what do i do ?
