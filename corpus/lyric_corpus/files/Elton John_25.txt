its a human sign.
when things go wrong.
when the scent of her lingers.
and temptations strong.

in to the boundary.
of each married man.
sweet deceit comes calling.
and negativity lands.

cold, cold heart.
hard done by you.
some things look better baby.
just passing through.

chorus.
and its no sacrifice.
just a simple word.
its two hearts living.
in two separate worlds.
but its no sacrifice.
no sacrifice.
its no sacrifice at all.

mutual misunderstanding.
after the fact.
sensitivity builds a prison.
in the final act.

we lose direction.
no stone unturned.
no tears to damn you.
when jealousy burns.

cold, cold heart.
hard done by you.
some things look better baby.
just passing through.

repeat chorus.

cold, cold heart.
hard done by you.
some things look better baby.
just passing through.

repeat chorus.

no sacrifice at all 5x.
