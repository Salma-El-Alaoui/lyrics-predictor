been hiding out and laying low.
its nothing new to me.
well, you can always find a place to go.
if you can keep your sanity.

they break down the doors and they rape my rights but.
they will not touch me.
they scream and yell and fight all night.
you can not tell me.

i lose my head, i close my eyes.
they will not touch me.
cause i got something  have been building up inside.
for so fucking long.

they are out ta get me.
they will not catch me.
i am fucking innocent.
they will not break me.

sometimes its easy to forget where you are going.
sometimes its harder to leave.
and evrytime you think you know just what you are doing.
thats when your troubles exceed.

they push me in a corner just to get me to fight but.
they will not touch me.
they preach and yell and fight all night.
you can not tell me.

i lose my head, i close my eyes.
they will not touch me.
cause i got something i have been building up inside.
i am already gone.

they are out ta get me.
they will not catch me.
cause i am innocent.
they will not break me.

no, no.
oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
no, oh, no, no, no.
let me see you try.

some people got a chip on their shoulder.
and some would say it was me.
but i did not buy that fifth of whiskey that you gave me.
so id be quick to disagree.

they are out ta get me.
they will not catch me.
i am fucking innocent.
they will not break me.

they are out ta get me.
they will not catch me.
cause i am innocent.
so you can suck me.

take that one to heart.
