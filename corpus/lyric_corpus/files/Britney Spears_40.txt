im not ashamed of the things that i dream.
i found myself flirting with the verge of obscene.
to the unknown i will be bold.
im going to the places i can be out of control.

bridge.
and i dont want to explain tonight.
all the things i have tried to hide.
i shut myself out from the world tonight.
and draw the blinds.
and i will teach myself to fly.

i love myself its not a sin.
i can not control whats happening.

chorus.
cuz i just discovered.
imaginations taking over.
another day without a lover.
the more i come to understand.
the touch of my hand.

the small of my back.
the arch of my feet.
lately i have been noticing the beautiful in me.
the mole in my skin and i am not going away.
i am in to myself in the most precious way.

bridge and chorus.

chorus x2.
