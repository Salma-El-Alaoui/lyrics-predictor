you said the way my blue eyes shined.
put those georgia stars to shame that night.
i said thats a lie.
just a boy in a chevy truck.
that had a tendency of getting stuck.
on backroads at night.
an i was right there beside him all summer long.
an then the time we woke up to find that summerd gone.

but when you think tim mcgraw.
i hope you think my favorite song.
the one we danced to all night long.
the moon like a spotlight on the lake.
when you think happiness.
i hope you think that little black dress.
think of my head on your chest.
an my old faded blue jeans.
when you think tim mcgraw.
i hope you think of me.

september saw a month of tears.
an thanking god that you were not here.
to see me like that.
but in a box beneath my bed.
is a letter that you never read.
from three summers back.
its hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet.
an looking back on all of that, its nice to believe.

when you think tim mcgraw.
i hope you think my favorite song.
the one we danced to all night long.
the moon like a spotlight on the lake.
when you think happiness.
i hope you think that little black dress.
think of my head on your chest.
an my old faded blue jeans.
when you think tim mcgraw.
i hope you think of me.

and i am back for the first time since then.
i am standing on your street.
an theres a letter left on your doorstep.
an the first thing that you will read.

is when you think tim mcgraw.
i hope you think my favorite song.
some day you will turn your radio on.
i hope it takes you back to that place.
when you think happiness.
i hope you think that little black dress.
think of my head on your chest.
an my old faded blue jeans.
when you think tim mcgraw.
i hope you think of me.
oh, think of me.
mmmm.

you said the way my blue eyes shined.
put those georgia stars to shame that night.
i said thats a lie.
