i am the man who walks alone.
and when i am walking a dark road.
at night or strolling through the park.

and when the light begins to change.
i sometimes feel a little strange.
a little anxious when its dark.

fear of the dark, fear of the dark.
i have a constant fear that somethings.
always near.
fear of the dark, fear of the dark.
i have a phobia that someones.
always there.

have you run your fingers down.
the wall.
and have you felt your neck skin crawl.
when you are searching for the light?
sometimes when you are scared.
to take a look.
at the corner of the room.
you have sensed that somethings.
watching you.

fear of the dark, fear of the dark.
i have constant fear that somethings.
always near.
fear of the dark, fear of the dark.
i have a phobia that someones.
always there.

have you ever been alone at night.
thought you heard footsteps behind.
and turned around and no ones there?
and as you quicken up your pace.
you find it hard to look again.
because you are sure theres.
someone there.

fear of the dark, fear of the dark.
i have constant fear that somethings.
always near.
fear of the dark, fear of the dark.
i have a phobia that someones.
always there.

solo.

fear of the dark, fear of the dark, fear of the dark, fear of the dark.
fear of the dark, fear of the dark, fear of the dark, fear of the dark.

watching horror films the night before.
debating witches and folklores.
the unknown troubles on your mind.
maybe your mind is playing tricks.
you sense, and suddenly eyes fix.
on dancing shadows from behind.

fear of the dark, fear of the dark.
i have constant fear that somethings.
always near.
fear of the dark, fear of the dark.
i have a phobia that someones.
always there.

fear of the dark, fear of the dark.
i have constant fear that somethings.
always near.
fear of the dark, fear of the dark.
i have a phobia that someones.
always there.

when i am walking a dark road.
i am the man who walks alone.
