well, you can tell by the way i use my walk.
i am a womans man, no time to talk.
music loud and women warm.
i have been kicked around since i was born.
and now its all right, thats okay.
you may look the other way.
we can try to understand.
the new york times effect on man.

chorus.
whether you are a brother or whether you are a mother.
you are staying alive, staying alive.
feel the city breaking and everybody shaking.
and you are staying alive, staying alive.
ah, ah, ah, ah, staying alive, staying alive.
ah, ah, ah, ah, staying alive.

oh, when you walk.

well, now i get low and i get high.
and if i can not get either, i really try.
got the wings of heaven on my shoes.
i am a dancing man and i just can not lose.
you know, its all right, its okay.
i will live to see another day.
we can try to understand.
the new york times effect on man.
