all i knew this morning when i woke.
is i know something now, know something now i did not before.
and all i have seen since eighteen hours ago.
is green eyes and freckles and your smile.
in the back of my mind making me feel like.

i just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now.
i just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now.

i just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now.
i just wanna know you, know you, know you.

cause all i know is we said, hello.
and your eyes look like coming home.
all i know is a simple name.
everything has changed.
all i know is you held the door.
you will be mine and i will be yours.
all i know since yesterday is everything has changed.

and all my walls stood tall painted blue.
and i will take them down, take them down and open up the door for you.

and all i feel in my stomach is butterflies.
the beautiful kind, making up for lost time.
album version taking flight, making me feel right.
remix version taking flight, making me feel right like.

i just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now.
i just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now.
i just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now.
i just wanna know you, know you, know you.

cause all i know is we said, hello.
and your eyes look like coming home.
all i know is a simple name.
everything has changed.
all i know is you held the door.
and you will be mine and i will be yours.
all i know since yesterday is everything has changed.

come back and tell me why.
i am feeling like i have missed you all this time, oh, oh, oh.
and meet me there tonight.
and let me know that its not all in my mind.

i just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now.
i just wanna know you, know you, know you.

all i know is we said, hello.
and your eyes look like coming home.
all i know is a simple name.
everything has changed.
all i know is you held the door.
you will be mine and i will be yours.
all i know since yesterday is everything has changed.

all i know is we said, hello.
so dust off your highest hopes.
all i know is pouring rain and everything has changed.
all i know is a new found grace.
all my days i will know your face.
all i know since yesterday is everything has changed.
