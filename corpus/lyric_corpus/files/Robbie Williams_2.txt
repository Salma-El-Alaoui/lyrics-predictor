how lucky can one guy be?
i kissed her and she kissed me.
like a fella once said.
aingt that a kick in the head?

the room was completely black.
i hugged her and she hugged back.
like a sailor said quote.
aingt that a hole in a boat?

my head keeps spinning.
i go to sleep and keep grinning.
if this is just the beginning.
my life is gonna be beautiful.

i have sunshine enough to spread.
its just like the fella said.
tell me quick.
