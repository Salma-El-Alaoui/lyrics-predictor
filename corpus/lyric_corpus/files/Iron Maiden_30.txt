o god of earth and altar.
bow down and hear our cry.
our earthly rulers falter.
our people drift and die.
the walls of gold entomb us.
the swords of scorn divide.
take not thy thunder from us.
but take away our pride.
g. k. chesterton english hymnal.

just a babe in the black abyss.
no reason for a place like this.
the walls are cold and souls cry out in pain.
an easy way for the blind to go.
a clever path for the fools who know.
the secret of the hanged man   the smile on his lips.

the light of the blind   you will see.
the venom that tears my spine.
the eyes of the nile are opening   you will see.

she came to me with a serpents kiss.
as the eye of the sun rose on her lips.
moonlight catches silver tears i cry.
so we lay in the black embrace.
and the seed is sown in a holy place.
and i watched, and i waited for the dawn.

the light of the blind   you will see.
the venom that tears my spine.
the eyes of the nile are opening   you will see.

solo dave   adrian.

bind all of us together.
ablaze with hope and free.
no storm or heavy weather.
will rock the boat you will see.
the time has come to close your eyes.
and still the wind and rain.
for the one who will be king.
is the watcher in the ring.
it is you.
