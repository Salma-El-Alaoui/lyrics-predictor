when you are talking to yourself.
and nobodys home.
you can fool yourself.
you came in this world alone.
alone.

so nobody ever told you baby.
how it was gonna be.
so what will happen to you baby.
guess we will have to wait and see.
one, two.

old at heart but i am only 28.
and i am much too young.
to let love break my heart.
young at heart but its getting much too late.
to find ourselves so far apart.

i do not know how you are sposed.
to find me lately.
an what more could you ask from me.
how could you say that i never needed you.
when you took everything.
said you took everything from me.

young at heart and it gets so hard to wait.
when no one i know can seem to help me now.
old at heart but i must not hesitate.
if i am to find my own way out.

still talking to myself.
and nobodys home.
alone.

so nobody ever told us baby.
how it was gonna be.
so what will happen to us baby.
guess we will have to wait and see.

when i find out all the reasons.
maybe i will find another way.
find another day.
with all the changing seasons of my life.
maybe i will get it right next time.
an now that you have been broken down.
got your head out of the clouds.
you are back down on the ground.
and you do not talk so loud.
an you do not walk so proud.
any more, and what for.

well i jumped into the river.
too many times to make it home.
i am out here on my own, an drifting all alone.
if it does not show give it time.
to read between the lines.
cause i see the storm getting closer.
and the waves they get so high.
seems everything we have ever knowns here.
why must it drift away and die.

i will never find anyone to replace you.
guess i will have to make it thru, this time  oh this time.
without you.

i knew the storm was getting closer.
and all my friends said i was high.
but everything we have ever knowns here.
i never wanted it to die.
