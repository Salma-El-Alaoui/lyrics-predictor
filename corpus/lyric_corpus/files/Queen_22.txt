sammy was low.
just watching the show.
over and over again.
knew it was time.
hed made up his mind.
to leave his dead life behind.
his boss said to him.
boy youd better begin.
to get those crazy notions right out of your head.
sammy who do you think that you are?
you should have been sweeping up the emerald bar.

spread your wings and fly away.
fly away far away.
spread your little wings and fly away.
fly away far away.
pull yourself together.
cos you know you should do better.
thats because you are a free man.

he spends his evenings alone in his hotel room.
keeping his thoughts to himself hed be leaving soon.
wishing he was miles and miles away.
nothing in this world nothing would make him stay.

since he was small.
had no luck at all.
nothing came easy to him.
now it was time.
hed made up his mind.
this could be my last chance.

his boss said to him now listen boy.
you are always dreaming.
you have got no real ambition you will not get very far.
sammy boy do not you know who you are?
why can not you be happy at the emerald bar?

so honey.
spread your wings and fly away.
fly away far away.
spread your little wings and fly away.
fly away far away.
pull yourself together.
cos you know you should do better.
thats because you are a free man.
come on honey.
fly with me!
