one two three four.

i was on the outside when you said.
you needed me.
i was looking at myself.
i was blind, i could not see.

a boy tries hard to be a man.
his mother takes him by his hand.
if he stops to think, he starts to cry.
oh why?

if you walk away, walk away.
i walk away, walk away.
i will follow.
if you walk away, walk away.
i walk away, walk away.
i will follow.
i will follow.

i was on the inside.
when they pulled the four walls down.
i was looking through the window.
i was lost, i am found.

if you walk away, walk away.
i walk away, walk away.
i will follow.
if you walk away, walk away.
i walk away, walk away.
i will follow.
i will follow.

your eyes make a circle.
i see you when i go in there.
your eyes, your eyes.
your eyes, your eyes.

if you walk away, walk away.
i walk away, walk away.
i will follow.
if you walk away, walk away.
i walk away, walk away.
i will follow.
i will follow..
