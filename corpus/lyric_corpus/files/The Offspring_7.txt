you brace and hold it all inside.
its more than you can stand.
no one around even tries.
tries to understand.

do not turn away, do not turn away.
come out swinging.
come out alone.
they are in your way, they are in your way.
but as long as you are swinging.
strong then you will get by.

your pacings wearing out a line.
right beside your bed.
the scene replays a million times.
stuck inside your head.

and though you stay in place.
your mind escapes.
read between the lies.
smiles on your face.
you fake like you are ok.

do not turn away, do not turn away.
come out swinging.
come out alone.
they are in your way, they are in your way.
you may be stinging.
but you will get by.
do not turn away, do not turn away.
come out swinging.
never alone again.
the pain inside can guide your way.

midnight, no sleep though.
inside, you scream to.
no one, hears you for.
daylight, prove me today day.
one more try.

do not turn away, do not turn.
come out swinging.
come out alone.
they are in your way, they are in your way.
you may be stinging.
but you will get by.
do not turn away, do not turn away.
come out swinging.
never alone again.
pain inside.
leads you leads you through so you will get by.
