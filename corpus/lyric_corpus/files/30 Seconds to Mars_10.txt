its the end here today.
but i will build a new beginning.
take some time, find a place.
and i will start my own religion.

as the day divides the night.
here we are searching for a sign.

watch the men multiply.
see them ease out of the circle.
watch your friends run and hide.
help them fall back in this cycle.

here we are searching...

you saw what you get.
if you take what you take.
look in the eye of the test.
its all because.
now theres a feeling i get.
when i look to the left.
but it should never be sensed.
our searching for a sign.

can you feel it?
things are changing.
can you see it?
watch as the worlds collide.
can you see it?
can you feel it?
watch as the worlds.
collide... into themselves.
collide... into themselves.

another time, another place.
another time, another place.
some paradigm has shunned the race.
