wanna tell you a story.
bout a woman i know.
when it comes to loving.
oh she steals the show.
she aingt exactly pretty.
aingt exactly small.
forty two, thirty nine, fifty six.
you could say shes got it all.

never had a woman.
never had a woman like you.
doing all the things.
doing all the things you do.
aingt no fairy story.
aingt no skin and bone.
but you give it all you got.
weighing in at nineteen stone.

you are a whole lotta woman.
a whole lotta woman.
whole lotta rosie.
and you are a whole lotta woman.

oh honey you can do it.
do it to me all night long.
only one to turn.
only one to turn me on.
all through the night time.
and right around the clock.
to my surprise.
rosie never stops.
