your heart is not open, so i must go.
the spell has been broken, i loved you so.
freedom comes when you learn to let go.
creation comes when you learn to say no.

you were my lesson, i had to learn.
i was your fortress, you had to burn.
pain is a warning that somethings wrong.
i pray to god that it will not be long.
do you wanna go higher.

theres nothing left to try.
theres no place left to hide.
theres no greater power.
than the power of goodbye.

your heart is not open, so i must go.
the spell has been broken, i loved you so.
you were my lesson, i had to learn.
i was your fortress.

theres nothing left to lose.
theres no more heart to bruise.
theres no greater power.
than the power of goodbye.

learn...to...say...good...bye.
i yearn...to...say...good...bye.

theres nothing left to try.
theres no more places to hide.
theres no greater power.
than the power of goodbye.

theres nothing left to lose.
theres no more heart to bruise.
theres no greater power.
than the power of good bye.
