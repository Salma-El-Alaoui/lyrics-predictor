arnold layne had a strange hobby.
collecting clothes.
moonshine washing line.
they suit him fine.
on the wall hung a tall mirror.
distorted view, see through baby blue.
oh, arnold layne.
its not the same, takes two to know.
two to know, two to know.
why can not you see?
arnold layne, arnold layne, arnold layne, arnold layne.

now hes caught   a nasty sort of person.
they gave him time.
doors bang   chain gang   he hates it.
oh, arnold layne.
its not the same, takes two to know.
two to know, two to know.
why can not you see?
arnold layne, arnold layne, arnold layne, arnold layne.

do not do it again.
