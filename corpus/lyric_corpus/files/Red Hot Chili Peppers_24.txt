things will never be the same.
still i am awfully glad i came.
resonating in the shape of things to come.
never waiting when i know theres only one.

messed it up but rest assured.
no one ever thinks they are cured.
just a minute while i reinvent myself.
make it up and then i take it off the shelf.

bridge.
over the laws of light.
over the moon by midnight.
let us do it all this time.
everyone wishing well we go and.

chorus.
everyone knows anything goes and now.
we are the lotus kids.
oh better take note of this.
for the story.

the rising moon is on the shine.
the blood of scorpios and nine.
like the fear thats in eyes of every doe.
say it now cause john and jane would like to know.

is it safe inside your head.
songs to serenade the dead.
all along i said i know no enemies.
mix it up until there are no pedigrees.

bridge.

chorus.

over the laws of light.
over the moon by midnight.
lets do it all this time.
into the shadow show and.

enter the rolling tide.
over the ocean so wide.
let us do it all this time.
everyone wishing well we go.

chorus x3.
