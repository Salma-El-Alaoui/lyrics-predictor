see it on the television every day.
hear it on the radio.
it aingt humid but it sure is hot.
down in mexico.
the boy is trying to tell me.
near enough to the edge beginning of the end.
say they have all been there.
too late my friend.

chorus.
riff raff.
always good for a laugh ha ha ha.
riff raff.
go on, laugh yourself in half.

smile awhile.

now i am the kind of guy who keeps his big mouth shut.
do not bother me.
somebody give me one arm up.
leave me in misery.
i have never shot nobody.
do not even carry a gun.
i aingt done nothing wrong.
i am just having fun.

chorus.
