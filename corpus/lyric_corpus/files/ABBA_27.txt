where are those happy days they seem so hard to find.
i try to reach for you but you have closed your mind.
whatever happened to our love.
i wish i understood.
it used to be so nice, it used to be so good.

so when you are near me darling can not you hear me, sos.
the love you gave me nothing else can save me, sos.
when you are gone.
how can i even try to go on.
when you are gone.
though i try how can i carry on.

you seem so far away though you were standing near.
you made me feel alive but something died i fear.
i really tried to make it up.
i wish i understood.
what happened to our love, it used to be so good.

how can i even try to go on.
