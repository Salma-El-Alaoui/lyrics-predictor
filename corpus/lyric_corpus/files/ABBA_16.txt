sometimes when i just can not sleep.
and you are on my mind and i am hurting deep.
at night, when the sun goes down.
and the lights turn on and you are not around.

i have been this way before.
but it was not you do.
this time i am sure.
i have been waiting for you.

i dream when i call your name.
and i am in a place that i can not explain.
and everything you see i can not come true.
its the way that it is.
its the way that i am through.

i have been this way before.
but it was not you do.
this time i am sure.
i have been waiting for you.
this time i am sure.
i have been waiting for you.

i have been waiting for you.
i have been waiting for you.
i have been waiting for you.
