when you get caught in the rain, with nowhere to run.
when you are distraught and in pain, without anyone.
when you keep crying out to be saved.
but nobody comes and you feel so far away.
that you just can not find your way home.
you can get there alone.
its okay, what you say is.

chorus.
i can make it through the rain.
i can stand up once again, on my own.
and i know that i am strong enough to mend.
and every time i feel afraid, i hold tighter to my faith.
and i live one more day.
and i make it through the rain.

and if you keep falling down, do not you dare give in.
you will arrive safe and sound.
so keep pressing on steadfastly.
and you will find what you need to prevail.
what you say.

chorus.

and when the wind blows.
as shadows grow close, do not be afraid.
theres nothing you can not face.
and sure they tell you, you will never pull through.
do not hesitate, stand tall and say, yeah.

chorus.

i can make it through the rain.
and stand up once again.
and i live one more day and night.
and i can make it through the rain.
oh yes you can.
you are gonna make it through the rain.
