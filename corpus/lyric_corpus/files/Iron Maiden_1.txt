kill for gain or shoot to maim.
but we do not need a reason.
the golden goose is on the loose.
and never out of season.
blackened pride still burns inside.
this shell of bloody treason.
heres my gun for a barrel of fun.
for the love of living death.

the killers breed or the demons seed.
the glamour, the fortune and the pain.
go to war again, blood is freedoms stain.
do not you pray for my soul anymore.

2 minutes to midnight.
the hands that threaten doom.
2 minutes to midnight.
to kill the unborn in the womb.

the blind men shout let the creatures out.
we will show the unbelievers.
the napalm screams of human flames.
of a prime time belsen feast...yeah!
as the reasons for the carnage cut their meat.
and lick the gravy.
we oil the jaws of the war machine.
and feed it with our babies.

the killers breed or the demons seed.
the glamour, the fortune and the pain.
go to war again, blood is freedoms stain.
do not you pray for my soul anymore.

2 minutes to midnight.
the hands that threaten doom.
2 minutes to midnight.
to kill the unborn in the womb.

the body bags and little rags of children.
torn in two.
and the jellied brains of those who remain.
to put the finger right on you.
as the madmen play on words and make us all.
dance to their song.
to the tune of starving millions.
to make a better kind of gun.

the killers breed or the demons seed.
the glamour, the fortune and the pain.
go to war again, blood is freedoms stain.
do not you pray for my soul anymore.

2 minutes to midnight.
the hands that threaten doom.
2 minutes to midnight.
to kill the unborn in the womb.
midnight... is all night...
midnight... all night....
