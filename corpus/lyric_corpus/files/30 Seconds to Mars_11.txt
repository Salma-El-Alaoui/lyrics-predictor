yeah, i have been to jupiter.
and i have fallen through the air.
i used to live out on the moon.
but now i am back here down on earth.

why are you here?
are you listening?
can you hear what i am saying?
i am not here, i am not listening.
i am in my head and i am spinning.

is this who you are?
some sweet violent urge?
a weak fallen man.
with the promise of an end?

all the pretty people died.
innocence is out of style.
all the whores have gone away.
now theres nothing left for me.

why are you here?
are you listening?
can you hear what i am saying?
i am not here, i am not listening.
i am in my head and i am spinning.

is this who you are?
some sweet violent urge?
a weak fallen man.
with the promise of an end?
