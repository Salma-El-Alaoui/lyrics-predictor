i am scared.
so afraid to show i care.
will he think me weak.
if i tremble when i speak.

ooohooohooo.
what if theres another one hes thinking of?
maybe hes in love.
id feel like a fool.
life can be so cruel.
i do not know what to do.

i have been there.
with my heart out in my hand.
but what you must understand.
you can not let the chance.
to love him pass you by.

tell him.
tell him that the sun and moon rise in his eyes.
reach out to him.

and whisper.
tender words so soft and sweet.
hold him close to feel his heart beat.
love will be the gift you give yourself.

touch him oooh.
with the gentleness you feel inside i feel it.
your love can not be denied.
the truth will set you free.
you will have whats meant to be.
all in time, you will see.

ooohooohooo.
i love him then show him.
of that much i can be sure hold him close to you.
i do not think i could endure.
if i let him walk away.
when i have so much to say.

tell him.
tell him that the sun and moon rise in his eyes.
reach out to him.

and whisper.
tender words so soft and sweet.
hold him close to feel his heart beat.
love will be the gift you give yourself.

love is light that surely glows.
in the hearts of those who know.
its a steady flame that grows.

feed the fire with all the passion you can show.

tonight love will assume its place.

this memory time cannot erase.

your faith will lead love where it has to go.

tell him.
tell him that the sun and moon rise in his eyes.
reach out to him.

and whisper ohoho!
whisper words so soft and sweet.
hold him close to feel his heart beat.
love will be the gift you give yourself.

never let him go.
