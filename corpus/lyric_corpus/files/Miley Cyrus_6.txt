i been in a rut, back and forth enough.
heart like a wheel.
without you around.
so uncomfortable is how it feels.

every time you are near trouble disappears.
under the ground.
but when you go too far.
silver clouds will start hanging around.

and i know i try to run.
but i keep on coming back full circle.
and i can not jump the track.
ca not let you go o o o.

tied to one.
so i keep on coming back full circle.
cause i know you will come around.
you will come around.

skipping down a broken path.
how long can i last? please let me know, oh.
wheres the finish line?
cause i got to find somewhere to go.

i do not wanna hear those people interfere.
what do they know?
what i feel inside when i am up all night.
needing you home.

i do not know why i try to run.
but i keep on coming back full circle.
and i can not jump the track.
ca not let you go o o o.

tied to one.
so i keep on coming back full circle.
cause i know you will come around.
you will come around.
cause i know you will come around.
you will come around.

i will keep on running till we meet in the middle.
i will put right aside and i will give just a little.
theres miles to go but we both know that we will make it.

and i know i try to run.
but i keep on coming back full circle.
and i can not jump the track.
ca not let you go o.

tied to one.
so i keep on coming back full circle.
cause i know you will come around.
you will come around.

yeah, i know you will come around.
you will come around.
yeah, i know you will come around.
you will come around.
