and in your eyes i see ribbons of color.
i see us inside of each other.
i feel my conscience merge with yours.
and i hear a voice say, ampquotwhats his is hersampquot.

i am falling into you.
this dream could come true.
and it feels so good falling into you.

i was afraid to let you in here.
now i have learned love can not be made in to fear.
the walls begin to tumble down.
and i can not even see the ground.

i am falling into you.
this dream could come true.
and it feels so good falling into you.

falling like a leaf, falling like a star.
finding a belief, falling where you are.

catch me, do not let me drop!
love me, do not ever stop!

so close your eyes and let me kiss you.
and while you sleep i will miss you.

oh i am falling into you.
this dream could come true.
and it feels so good falling into you.

falling like a leaf, falling like a star, oh.
finding a belief, falling where you are.

falling into you.
falling into you.
falling into you.
