sometimes i feel my life is going round in circles.

beneath my eyes are bluish black.

theres nothing new, no one i wanna talk to.

nothing i wanna think about, i got soul doubt.

i stick my head out of the window, its closed.

instead of air, i get glass stuck in to my head.

the citys sounding, and i can not seem to stop the pounding.

ca not keep my thoughts from flying round  x 2 .

not sure what i am thinking about, i got soul doubt.

a shameless display, wearing a smile full of pain.

a frameless erte, a painting without a signature.

shes waiting for someone to save her.

as i pass her i see cinderella.

she dose not fit into the slipper.

like she fits in a bottle of liquor.

theres no one to take her away.

her eyes meet mine, she sees right through me.

the question is asked, whatcha gonna do for me?

i do not want nothing, just a connection.

i gotta know what shes all about.

cause i know shes been there   .

soul doubt.

i stick my head out of the window once again.

this time i see a thousand faces all too clear.

they wear the same expression, i have seen in my face.

so many times, i know exactly how they feel.

i know exactly how they feel.

i know just what they think about.

they have got soul doubt.
