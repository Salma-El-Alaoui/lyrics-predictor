its easier to run.
replacing this pain with something numb.
its so much easier to go.
than face all this pain here all alone.

something has been taken from deep inside of me.
a secret i have kept locked away, no one can ever see.
wounds so deep they never show, they never go away.
like moving pictures in my head, for years and years they have played.

if i could change, i would take back the pain, i would.
retrace every wrong move that i made, i would.
if i could stand up and take the blame, i would.
if i could take all the shame to the grave, i would.
if i could change, i would take back the pain, i would.
retrace every wrong move that i made, i would.
if i could stand up and take the blame, i would.
i would take all my shame to the grave.

its easier to run.
replacing this pain with something numb.
its so much easier to go.
than face all this pain here all alone.

sometimes i remember the darkness of my past.
bringing back these memories i wish i did not have.
sometimes i think of letting go and never looking back.
and never moving forward so thered never be a past.

if i could change, i would take back the pain, i would.
retrace every wrong move that i made, i would.
if i could stand up and take the blame, i would.
if i could take all the shame to the grave, i would.
if i could change, i would take back the pain, i would.
retrace every wrong move that i made, i would.
if i could stand up and take the blame, i would.
i would take all my shame to the grave.

just washing it aside.
all of the helplessness inside.
pretending i do not feel misplaced.
is so much simpler than change.

its easier to run.
replacing this pain with something numb.
its so much easier to go.
than face all this pain here all alone.

its easier to run!
if i could change, i would take back the pain, i would.
retrace every wrong move that i made.
its easier to go!
if i could change, i would take back the pain, i would.
retrace every wrong move that i made, i would.
if i could stand up and take the blame, i would.
i would take all my shame to the grave..
