new blood joins this earth.
and quickly hes subdued.
through constant pained disgrace.
the young boy learns their rules.

with time the child draws in.
this whipping boy done wrong.
deprived of all his thoughts.
the young man struggles on and on hes known.
a vow unto his own.
that never from this day.
his will they will take away.

what i have felt.
what i have known.
never shined through in what i have shown.
never be.
never see.
will not see what might have been.

what i have felt.
what i have known.
never shined through in what i have shown.
never free.
never me.
so i dub thee unforgiven.

they dedicate their lives.
to running all of his.
he tries to please them all.
this bitter man he is.
throughout his life the same.
hes battled constantly.
this fight he cannot win.
a tired man they see no longer cares.
the old man then prepares.
to die regretfully.
that old man here is me.

what i have felt.
what i have known.
never shined through in what i have shown.
never be.
never see.
will not see what might have been.

what i have felt.
what i have known.
never shined through in what i have shown.
never free.
never me.
so i dub thee unforgiven.

instrumental solo.

what i have felt.
what i have known.
never shined through in what i have shown.
never be.
never see.
will not see what might have been.

what i have felt.
what i have known.
never shined through in what i have shown.
never free.
never me.
so i dub thee unforgiven.

never free.
never me.
so i dub thee unforgiven.

you labeled me.
i will label you.
so i dub thee unforgiven.

never free.
never me.
so i dub thee unforgiven.

you labeled me.
i will label you.
so i dub thee unforgiven.

never free.
never me.
so i dub thee unforgiven....
