falling, i am falling.

have you ever walked through a room.
but it was more like the room passed around you.
like there was a leash around your neck that pulled you through.

have you ever been at someplace.
recognizing everybodys face.
until you realized that there was no one there you knew.
well i know.

some days, my souls confined and out of mind.
sleep forever.
some days, i am so outshined and out of time.
have you ever.

falling, i am falling.

have you ever buried your face in your hands.
cause no one around you understands.
or has the slightest idea what it is that makes you be.

have you ever felt like there was more.
like someone else was keeping score.
and what could make you whole was simply out of reach.
well i know.

someday i will try again and not pretend.
this time forever.
someday i will get it straight but not today.
have you ever.

falling, i am falling.

some days, my souls confined and out of mind.
sleep forever.
some days, my darkest friend is me again.
have you ever.
someday i will try again and not pretend.
this time forever.
someday i will get it straight but not today.
have you ever.

who is gonna stay.
cause id like to think the world is a better place.
