nobody likes you...
everyone left you...
they are all out without you...
having fun...

where have all the bastards gone?
the underbelly stacks up ten high.
the dummy failed the crash test.
collecting unemployment checks.
like a flunkies along for a ride.

where have all the riots gone.
as your citys motto gets pulverized?
whats in love is now in debt.
on your birth certificate.
so strike the fucking match to light this fuse!

the town bishop is an extortionist.
and he do not even know that you exist.
standing still when its do or die.
you better run for your fucking life.

its not over till your underground.
its not over before its too late.
this cities burning.
its not my burden.
its not over before its too late.

theres nothing left to analyze.

where will all the martyrs go when the virus cures itself?
and where will we all go when its too late?

and do not look back.

you are not the jesus of suburbia.
the st. jimmy is a figment of.
your fathers rage and your mothers love.
made me the idiot america.

its not over till your underground.
its not over before its too late.
its cities burning.
its not my burden.
its not over before its too late.

she said i can not take this place.
i am leaving it behind.

well she said i can not take this town.
i am leaving you tonight.
