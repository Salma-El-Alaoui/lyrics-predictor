all is quiet on new years day.
a world in white gets underway.
and i want to be with you.
be with you night and day.
nothing changes on new years day.
on new years day.
i... will be with you again.
i... will be with you again.

under a blood red sky.
a crowd has gathered in black and white.
arms entwined.
the chosen few.
the newspaper says, says.
says its true, says its true and.
we can break through.
torn in two.
we can be one.
i... i will begin again.
i... i will begin again.

yeah.
oh...

oh and maybe the time is right.
oh... maybe tonight.
i... will be with you again.
i... will be with you again.

and so we are told this is the golden age.
and gold is the reason for the wars we wage.
though i want to be with you.
to be with you night and day.
nothing changes on new years day.

on new years day...
on new years day....
