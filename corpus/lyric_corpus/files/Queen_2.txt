one dream one soul, one prize.
one goal, one golden glance of what should be.

one shaft of light that shows the way.

the bell that rings inside your mind.
its challenging the doors of time.

the waiting seems eternity.
the day will dawn of sanity.

there can be only one.
this rage that lasts a thousand years.
will soon be gone.
this flame that burns inside of me.
i am hearing secret harmonies.
its a kind of magic.
the bell that rings inside your mind.
its challenging the doors of time.
its a kind of magic.
its a kind of magic.
this rage that lasts a thousand years.
will soon be, will soon be.

there can be only one.
this rage that lasts a thousand years.
will soon be gone.
