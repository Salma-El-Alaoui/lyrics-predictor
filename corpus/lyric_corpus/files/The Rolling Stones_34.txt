i want you back again.
i want your love again.
i know you find it hard to reason with me.
but this time its different, darling you will see.

you gotta tell me you are coming back to me.
you gotta tell me you are coming back to me.
you gotta tell me you are coming back to me.
you gotta tell me you are coming back to me.

you said we are through before.
you walked out on me before.
i tried to tell you, but you did not want to know.
this time you are different and determined to go.

you gotta tell me you are coming back to me.
you gotta tell me you are coming back to me.
you gotta tell me you are coming back to me.
you gotta tell me you are coming back to me.

i wait as the days go by.
i long for the nights to go by.
i hear the knock on my door that never comes.
i hear the telephone that has not rung.

you gotta tell me you are coming back to me.
you gotta tell me you are coming back to me.
you gotta tell me you are coming back to me.
you gotta tell me you are coming back to me.
