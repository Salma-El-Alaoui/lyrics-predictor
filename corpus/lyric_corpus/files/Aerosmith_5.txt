but nothing seemed to light my fuse.

but its all in the past.
like a check thats in the mail.

i was an old hound dog that just loved to chase his tail.

until i met a blind man.
who taught me how to see, yeah.
a blind man.
who could change night into day.
and if i can.
i am gonna make you come with me, yeah.
because here comes the sun and we will be chasing all the clouds away.

some things are never what they seem.
my heavens turned into a landslide.

and drink all the flowers dry.
