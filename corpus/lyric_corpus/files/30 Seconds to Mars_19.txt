what if i wanted to break.
laugh it all off in your face.
what would you do?
what if i fell to the floor.
could not take all this anymore.
what would you do, do, do?

come.
break me down.
bury me, bury me.
i am finished with you.

what if i wanted to fight.
beg for the rest of my life.
what would you do?
you say you wanted more.
what are you waiting for.
i am not running from you.

come.
break me down.
bury me, bury me.
i am finished with you.
look in my eyes.
you are killing me, killing me.
all i wanted was you.

i tried to be someone else.
but nothing seemed to change.
i know now, this is who i really am inside.
finally found myself.
fighting for a chance.
i know now, this is who i really am.

come.
break me down.
bury me, bury me.
i am finished with you, you, you.
look in my eyes.
you are killing me, killing me.
all i wanted was you.
come, break me down.
break me down.
break me down.

what if i wanted to break...?
