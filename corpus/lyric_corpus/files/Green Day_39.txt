thought i ran into you down on the street.
then it turned out to only be a dream.

i made a point to burn all of the photographs.
she went away and then i took a different path.
i remember the face.
but i can not recall the name.
now i wonder how whatsername has been.

seems that she disappeared without a trace.
did she ever marry old whats his face?

it seems like forever ago.
remember, whatever.
it seems like forever ago.

the regrets are useless.
in my mind.
shes in my head.
i must confess.
the regrets are useless.
shes in my head.
from so long ago.

go, go, go, go...

and in the darkest night.
if my memory serves me right.
i will never turn back time.

forgetting you, but not the time.
