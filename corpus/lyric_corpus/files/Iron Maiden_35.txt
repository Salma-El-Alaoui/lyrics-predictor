trace your way back 50 years.
to the glow of dresden   blood and tears.
in the black above by the cruel searchlight.
men will die and men will fight   yeah!
who shoot who and who fired first?
dripping death to wet the bloodthirst.
no radar lock on   skin and bone.
the bomber boys are going home.

chours.
climb into the sky never wonder why   tailgunner.
you are a tailgunner.
climb into the sky never wonder why   tailgunner.
you are a tailgunner.
climb into the sky never wonder why   tailgunner.
you are a tailgunner.
climb into the sky never wonder why   tailgunner.
you are a tailgunner.

nail that fokker kill that son.
gonna blow your guts out with my gun.
the weather forecasts good for war.
colonge and frankfurt? have some more!
tail end charlie in the boiling sky.
the enola gay was my last try.
now that this tailguners gone.
no more bombers just one big bomb.

chorus.
