no more carefree laughter.
silence ever after.
walking through an empty house, tears in my eyes.
here is where the story ends, this is goodbye.

knowing me, knowing you.
there is nothing we can do.
knowing me, knowing you.
we just have to face it, this time we are through.

breaking up is never easy, i know but i have to go.
knowing me, knowing you.
its the best i can do.

memories, good days, bad days.
they will be with me always.
in these old familiar rooms children would play.
now theres only emptiness, nothing to say.

knowing me, knowing you.
there is nothing we can do.
knowing me, knowing you.
we just have to face it, this time we are through.

breaking up is never easy, i know but i have to go.
knowing me, knowing you.
its the best i can do.

knowing me, knowing you.
there is nothing we can do.
knowing me, knowing you.
we just have to face it, this time we are through.

breaking up is never easy, i know but i have to go.
knowing me, knowing you.
its the best i can do.
