everyone falls in love sometime.
sometimes its wrong, and sometimes its right.
for every win, someone must fail.
but there comes a point when.
when we exhale yeah, yeah, say.

chorus.
shoop, shoop, shoop.
shoop be doop, shoop, shoop.

sometimes you will laugh.
sometimes you will cry.
life never tells us, the whens or whys.
when you have got friends, to wish you well.
you will find your point when.
you will exhale yeah, yeah, say.


chorus.

hearts are often broken.
when there are words unspoken.
in your soul theres answers to your prayers.
if you are searching for a place you know.
a familiar face, somewhere to go.
you should look inside yourself.
you are halfway there.

sometimes you will laugh.
sometimes you will cry.
life never tells us, the whens or whys.
when you have got friends, to wish you well.
you will find your point when.
you will exhale yeah, yeah, say.


chorus.
