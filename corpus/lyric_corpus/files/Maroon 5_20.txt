sunday morning, rain is falling.
steal some covers, share some skin.
clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable.
you twist to fit the mold that i am in.
but things just get so crazy.
living life gets hard to do.
and i would gladly hit the road, get up and go if i knew.
that someday it would lead me back to you.
that someday it would lead me back to you.

that may be all i need.
in darkness she is all i see.
come and rest your bones with me.
driving slow on sunday morning.
and i never want to leave.

fingers trace your every outline.
paint a picture with my hands.
back and forth we sway like branches in a storm.
change the weather still together when it ends.

that may be all i need.
in darkness she is all i see.
come and rest your bones with me.
driving slow on sunday morning.
and i never want to leave.

but things just get so crazy living life gets hard to do.
sunday morning rain is falling and i am calling out to you.
singing someday it will bring me back to you, yeah.
find a way to bring myself back home to you.

you may not know.
that may be all i need.
in darkness she is all i see.
oh, come and rest your bones with me.
driving slow, driving slow all i need, all i see.
oh yeah yeah oh yeah yeah oh yeah yeah bones with me.
i am a flower in your hair.
yeah yeah, yeah yeah.
