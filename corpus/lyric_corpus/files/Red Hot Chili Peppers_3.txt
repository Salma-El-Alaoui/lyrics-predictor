someone spilled blood many years ago.
someone spilled blood but do you know.
that from the backwoods.
where the chuck berries grow.
come your long tall.
daddies of a rock and roll.

take me to your backwoods now.
take me to your backwoods now.

spinning down from the clouds.
like a tornado.
spinning out of control.
like a psychedelic soul.
with a rhythm hitting harder.
than larry holmes.
come your long tall.
daddies of rock and roll.

take me to your backwoods now.
take me to your backwoods now.
take me to your backwoods now.
take me to your backwoods now.

mr uplift mofo   my man bo diddley.
hit sipping a bottle of nickle ripple.
play the lickity split finger licking licks.
for all you wicked city slick chicks.

and all you nitty gritty hick.
we will make your nipples ripple.
make you wanna dip your dipple.
make you wanna soak your hickory stick.
thats right.
because my man has a grip on it.
and i do mean on it.
which brings to mind.
a very sinister minister kind of guy.
a man named little richard.
who was born to make them bitches stir.
thats right he will make the sweet substance drip.
from the middle of your hillbilly lips.
and like the farmer milks his cow.
the howling wolf will howl.
and since times does allow.
you all can take me to your backwoods now.

take me to your backwoods now.
take me to your backwoods now.
take me to your backwoods now.
take me to your backwoods now.
take me to your backwoods.
