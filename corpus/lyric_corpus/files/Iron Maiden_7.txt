honey its getting close to midnight.
and all the myths are in town.
true love and lipstick on your linen.
bite the pillow make no sound.
if theres some living to be done.
before your life becomes your tomb.
youd better know that i am the one.
so unchain your back door invite me around.

chorus.
bring your daughter,bring your daughter to the slaughter.
let her go,let her go,let her go.
bring your daughter,bring your daughter to the slaughter.
let her go,let her go,let her go.
let her go.

honey its getting close to daybreak.
the sun is creeping in the sky.
no patent remedies for heartache.
just empty words and humble pie.
so get down on your kneees honey.
assume an attitude.
you just pray that i will be waiting.
cos you know i am coming soon.

chorus.

pick up your foolish pride,no going back.
no where,no way,no place to hide.

solo.

bring me your daughter, bring me your daughter, bring me your daughter, bring me your daughter, bring me your daughter, bring me your daughter, to the slaughter.
bring me your daughter, bring me your daughter, bring me your daughter, bring me your daughter, bring me your daughter, bring me your daughter, to the slaughter.

bring me your daughter, fetch your daughter, bring me your daughter, fetch your daughter, bring me your daughter, fetch your daughter, to the slaughter.
bring me your daughter, fetch your daughter, bring me your daughter, fetch your daughter, bring me your daughter, fetch your daughter, to the slaughter.
