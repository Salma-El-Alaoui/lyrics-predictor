what do i got to do to make you love me.
what do i got to do to make you care.
what do i do when lightning strikes me.
and awake to find that you are not there.

what do i got to do to make you want me.
what do i got to do to be heard.
what do i say when its all over.
sorry seems to be the hardest word.

chorus.
its sad so sad so sad.
its a sad sad situation.
and its getting more and more absurd.
its sad so sad so sad.
why can not we talk it over.
oh, it seems to me.
that sorry seems to be the hardest word.

its sad so sad so sad.
its a sad sad situation.
and its getting more and more absurd.
its sad so sad so sad.
why can not we talk it over.
oh, it seems to me.
that sorry seems to be the hardest word.

what do i do to make you love me.
what do i got to do to be heard.
what do i do when lightning strikes me.
what have i got to do? 2x.

when sorry seems to be the hardest word....
