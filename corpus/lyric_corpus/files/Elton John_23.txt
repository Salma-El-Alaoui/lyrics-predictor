ever since i was a young boy i played the silver ball.
from soho down to brighton i must have played em all.
but i aingt seen nothing like him in any amusement hall.
that deaf, dumb and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball.

he stands like a statue, becomes part of the machine.
feeling all the bumpers, always playing clean.
he plays by intuition, the digit counters fall.
that deaf, dumb and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball.

hes a pinball wizard, there has to be a twist.
a pinball wizards got such a supple wrist.
how do you think he does it?   i do not know.
what makes him so good?

well, he aingt got no distractions, can not hear no buzzes or bells.
do not see no lights a flashing, he plays by sense of smell.
always have a replay, never tilts at all.
that deaf, dumb and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball.

he can not beat me now, i have always been the champ.
i know every trick, no freaks gonna beat my hand.

even on my usual table, he can beat the best.
his disciples lead him in and he just does the rest.
hes got crazy flipper fingers, i have never seen him fall.
that deaf, dumb and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball.

hes a pinball wizard, there has to be a twist.
a pinball wizards got such a supple wrist.

hes a pinball wizard, he scores a trillion more.
a pinball wizard, the worlds new pinball lord.
hes scoring more, hes scoring more.

i thought i was the bally table king.
but i just handed my pinball crown to him.
to him, to him!
