in the evening, when the day is done.
i am looking for a woman, but the girl do not come.
so do not let her, play you for a fool.
she do not show no pity baby, she do not make no rules.

chorus oh, oh, i need your love, i need your love.
oh, i need your love, i just got to have.

so do not you let her, oh, get under your skin.
its only bad luck and trouble, from the day that you begin.
i hear you crying in the darkness, do not ask nobodys help.
aingt no pockets full of mercy baby, cause you can only blame yourself.

chorus.

oh its simple, all the pain that you go through.
you can turn away from fortune, fortune, cause thats all thats left to you.
its lonely at the bottom, man, its dizzy at the top.
but if you are standing in the middle, aingt no way you are gonna stop.

chorus.

oh whatever that your days may bring.
no use hiding in a corner, cause that will not change a thing.
if you are dancing in the doldrums, one day soon, its got to stop, its got to stop.
when you are the master of the off chance, when you do not expect a lot.

chorus.
