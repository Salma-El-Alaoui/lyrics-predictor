you are not a ship to carry my life.
you are nailed to my love in many lonely nights.
i have strayed from the cottages and found myself here.
for i need your love. your love protects my fears.

chorus.
and i wonder sometimes, and i know i am unkind.
but i need you to turn to when i act so blind.
oh i need you to turn to when i lose control.
you are my guardian angel who keeps out the cold.

did you paint your smile on when i said i knew.
that my reason for living was for loving you.
we are related in feeling, but you are high above.
you are pure and you are gentle, with the grace of a dove.

chorus.
