i can not light no more of your darkness.
all my pictures seem to fade to black and white.
i am growing tired and time stands still before me.
frozen here on the ladder of my life.

its much too late to save myself from falling.
i took a chance and changed the way of life.
but you misread my meaning when i met you.
closed the door and left me blind by the light.

do not let the sun go down on me yeah.
although i search myself its always someone else i see.
id just allow a fragment of your life to wander free ohh.
but losing everything is like the sun going down on me.

ladies amp gentleman mr. elton john.
i can not find oh the right romantic line.
but see me once and see the way i feel.
do not discard me just because you think i mean you harm.
but these cuts i have they need love to help them heal oh.

do not let the sun go down on me yeah.
although i search myself its always someone else i see.
id just allow a fragment of your life to wander free ohh.
cause losing everything is like the sun going down on me.

do not let the sun go down on me.
although i search myself its always someone else i see yeah.
id just allow a fragment of your life to wander free baby.
cause losing everything is like the sun going down on me.
mr. elton john.
