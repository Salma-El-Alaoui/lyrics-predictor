i do not want a lot for christmas.
there is just one thing i need.
i do not care about the presents.
underneath the christmas tree.
i just want you for my own.
more than you could ever know.
make my wish come true oh.
all i want for christmas is you.

i do not want a lot for christmas.
there is just one thing i need, and i.
do not care about the presents.
underneath the christmas tree.
i do not need to hang my stocking.
there upon the fireplace.
santa claus will not make me happy.
with a toy on christmas day.

i just want you for my own.
more than you could ever know.
make my wish come true.
all i want for christmas is you.

i will not ask for much this christmas.
i will not even wish for snow, and i.
i just wanna keep on waiting.
underneath the mistletoe.

i will not make a list and send it.
to the north pole for saint nick.
i will not even stay awake.
to hear those magic reindeer click.

cause i just want you here tonight.
holding on to me so tight.
what more can i do.
oh, baby all i want for christmas is you.

all the lights are shining.
so brightly everywhere.
and the sound of childrens.
laughter fills the air.

and everyone is singing.
i hear those sleigh bells ringing.
santa will not you bring me.
the one i really need.
will not you please bring my baby to me quickly.

i do not want a lot for christmas.
this is all i am asking for.
i just wanna see my baby.
standing right outside my door.

i just want you for my own.
more than you could ever know.
make my wish come true.
baby all i want for christmas is you.

all i want for christmas is you, baby repeat.
