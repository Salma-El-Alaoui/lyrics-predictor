another prophet of disaster.
who says the ship is lost.
another prophet of disaster.
leaving you to count the cost.
taunting us with visions.
afflicting us with fear.
predicting war for millions.
in the hope that one appears.

no point asking when it is.
no point asking whos to go.
no point asking whats the game.
no point asking whos to blame.
cos if you are gonna die, if you are gonna die.
cos if you are gonna die, if you are gonna die.

if you are gonna die, die with your boots on.
if you are gonna try, we will stick around.
gonna cry, just move along.
if you are gonna die, you are gonna die.

in 13 the beast is rising.
the frenchman did surmise.
through earthquakes and starvation.
the warlord will arise.
terror, death, destruction.
pour from the eastern sands.
but the truth of all predictions.
is always in your hands.

if you are gonna die, die with your boots on.
if you are gonna try, we will stick around.
gonna cry, just move along.
if you are gonna die, you are gonna die..
