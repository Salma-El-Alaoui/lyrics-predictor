if you want me, the cherry on top, the pick of the pack.
the crme de la crop.
if you want me you better do better than that tonight.
oh, oh.
if you want me, it takes more than a wink, more than a drink and more than you think.
if you want me you are gonna have to break the bank tonight.
cause some do not have the patience, some call me high maintenance.
but you pay the bill, cause thats the deal.

if you wanna ride, just name your price.
do not play cheap, with your heart.
do not make a bet if you can not write the cheque, for me, for me.
cause i can be bought, but you will pay the cost.
if you can afford me.

if you want me, i am not a piece of ass, a one night stand, a storage shed.
i think you better walk by, tonight.
oh, no.
if you want me, then stop begging, i do not put out for charity.
if you want me theres no discount price tonight.
but i do not need your dollar bills, i just want something real.
cause, nothings free, except loving me.

if you wanna ride, just name your price.
do not play cheap, with your heart.
