oh it seemed forever stopped today.
all the lonely hearts in london.
caught a plane and flew away.
and all the best women are married.
all the handsome men are gay.
you feel deprived.

yeah are you questioning your size?
is there a tumour in your humour?
are there bags under your eyes?
do you leave dents where you sit.
are you getting on a bit?
will you survive.
you must survive.

when theres no love in town.
this new century keeps bringing you down.
all the places you have been.
trying to find a love supreme.
a love supreme.

oh what are you really looking for?
another partner in your life.
to abuse and to adore?
is it lovey dovey stuff.
do you need a bit of rough?
get on your knees.

yeah turn down the love songs that you hear.
cause you can not avoid the sentiment.
that echoes in your ear.
saying love will stop the pain.
saying love will kill the fear.
do you believe.
you must believe.

when theres no love in town.
this new century keeps bringing you down.
all the places you have been.
trying to find a love supreme.
a love supreme.

i spy with my little eye.
something beginning with ah.
got my back up.
and now shes screaming.
so i have got to turn the track up.
sit back and watch the royalties stack up.
i know this girl she likes to switch teams.
and i am a fiend but i am living for a love supreme.

when theres no love in town.
this new century keeps bringing you down.
all the places you have been.
trying to find a love supreme.
a love supreme.

come and live a love supreme.
do not let it get you down.
everybody looks for love.
repeat until fade.
