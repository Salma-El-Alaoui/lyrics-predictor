this state, i am in.
a place i have never been.
i am dying to meet you here.

come break this skin.
i will let you sink right in.
and show you everything.
see you in hell.

we will gather around the fire.
and i will lead the choir.
sing farewell.
see you in hell.

dont break my spell.
we will drown the wishing well.
we will find some time to kill.

i will be right there.
the buzz inside your head.
the horrible electric chair.
see you in hell.

we will gather around the fire.
and i will lead the choir.
sing farewell.
see you in hell.
