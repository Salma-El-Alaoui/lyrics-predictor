i used to be on a endless run.
believe in miracles cause i am one.
i have been blessed with the power to survive.
and after all these years i am still alive.
i am outta here kicking with the band.
i am no longer a solitary man.
every day my time runs out.
lived like a fool that what i was about oh.

i believe in miracles.
i believe in a better world, for me and you.
oooh, and i believe in miracles.
i believe in a better world for me and you.

tatooed your name on my arm.
i always said my girl is a good luck charm.
if she can find a reason to forgive.
then i can find a reason to live.
i used to be on a endless run.
believe in miracles cause i am one.
i have been blessed with the power to survive.
and after all these years i am still alive.

i believe in a better world for me and you.

i close my eyes and it think how.

and i believe in a better world for me and you.
ohh i believe in miracles.
and i believe in a better world for me and you.
