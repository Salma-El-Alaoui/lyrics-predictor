let us take some time to talk this over.
you are out of line and rarely sober.
we can not depend on your excuses.

tom.
you can only lean on me for so long.
bring your ship about to watch a friend drown.
stood up on the ledge.
begged you to come down.
you can only lean on me for so long.

mark.
i remember shots, without a chaser.
absent minded thoughts, now you are a stranger.
cover up the scars.
put on your game face.
left you in a bar.
to try and save face.
