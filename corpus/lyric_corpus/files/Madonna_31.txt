papa i know you are going to be upset.
cause i was always your little girl.
but you should know by now.
i am not a baby.

you always taught me right from wrong.
i need your help, daddy please be strong.
i may be young at heart.
but i know what i am saying.

the one you warned me all about.
the one you said i could do without.
we are in an awful mess, and i do not mean maybe   please.

chorus.

papa do not preach, i am in trouble deep.
papa do not preach, i have been losing sleep.
but i made up my mind, i am keeping my baby, oh.
i am gonna keep my baby, mmm...

he says that hes going to marry me.
we can raise a little family.
maybe we will be all right.
its a sacrifice.

but my friends keep telling me to give it up.
saying i am too young, i ought to live it up.
what i need right now is some good advice, please.

chorus.

daddy, daddy if you could only see.
just how good hes been treating me.
youd give us your blessing right now.
cause we are in love, we are in love, so please.

chorus.

papa do not preach, i am in trouble deep.
papa do not preach, i have been losing sleep.
repeat.

oh, i am gonna keep my baby, ooh.
do not you stop loving me daddy.
i know, i am keeping my baby.
