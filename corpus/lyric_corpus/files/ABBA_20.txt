i work all night i work all day to pay the bills i have to pay.
aingt it sad.
and still there never seems to be a single penny left for me.
thats too bad.
in my dreams.
i have a plan.
if i got me a wealthy man.
i would not have to work at all id fool around and have a ball.

chorus.
money money money.
must be funny.
in the rich mans world.
money money money.
always sunny.
in the rich mans world.
ahaaa.
all the things i could do.
if i had a little money.
its a rich mans world.

its a rich mans world.

a man like that is hard to find but i can not get him off my mind.
aingt it sad.
and if he happens to be free i bet he would not fancy me.
thats too bad.
so i must leave.
i will have to go.
to las vegas or monaco.
and win a fortune in a game my life would never be the same.

chorus x2.

its a rich mans world.
