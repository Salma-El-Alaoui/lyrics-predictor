well i am going out west where i belong.
where the days are short and the nights are long.

and i will walk.
and they will walk.
and i will twist.
and they will twist.
and i will shimmy.
and they will shimmy.
and i will fly.
and they will fly.

where we are out there having fun.
in the warm california sun.

where the california girls are really the most.

and i will walk.
and they will walk.
and i will twist.
and they will twist.
and i will shimmy.
and they will shimmy.
and i will fly.
and they will fly.

where we are out there having fun.
in the warm california sun.

and i will walk.
and they will walk.
and i will twist.
and they will twist.
and i will shimmy.
and they will shimmy.
and i will fly.
and they will fly.

in the warm california sun.
