can i get your hand to write on.
just a piece of lead to bite on.
what a night to fly my kite on.
do you want to flash your light on.
take a look its on display for you.
coming down no not today.

did you meet your fortune teller.
get it off with no propeller.
do it up its on with stella.
what a way to finally smell her.
picking up but not too strong for you.
take a piece and pass it on.

fly away on my zephyr.
i feel it more than ever.
and in this perfect weather.
we will find a place together.
fly on my wind.

rebel and a liberator.
find a way to be a skater.
rev it up to levitate her.
super friendly aviator.
take a look its on display for you.
coming down no not today.

fly away on my zephyr.
i feel it more then ever.
and in this perfect weather.
we will find a place together.

in the water where i center my emotion.
all the world can pass me by.
fly away on my zephyr.
we will find a place together.

whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, do you.
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, will not you.
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

fly away on my zephyr.
i feel it more then ever.
and in this perfect weather.
we will find a place together.

in the water where i center my emotion.
all the world can pass me by.
fly away on my zephyr.
we are gonna live forever.
forever.
