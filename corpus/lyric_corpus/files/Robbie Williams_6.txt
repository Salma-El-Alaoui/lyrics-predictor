canned laughter for applause.
you have opened up doors.
in and out of their wives.
in and out of your smalls.
its not a bafta you are after.
you want a million dollar lay.
by all means necessary.
you will get your way.

it all seems so easy.
but so are you.
thats what i have heard them say.

all the make up that you wear.
ca not hide the flaws.
your work in charity for your own cause.
you will not be dating a teacher.
youd rather shag a manic street preacher.
by all means necessary.
you will get your way.

it all seems so easy.
but so are you.
thats what i have heard them say.

by all means necessary.
you will get your way.
by all means necessary.
you will get your way.

by giving it away.
