i will not suffer, be broken, get tired, or wasted.
surrender to nothing, and give up what i.
started and stopped it, from end to beginning.
a new day is coming, and i am finally free.

run away, run away, i will attack.
run away, run away, go chase yourself.
run away, run away, now, i will attack.
i will attack, i will aa whoooaaaaaaaaa.

i would have kept you forever, but we had to sever.
it ended for both of us, faster than a .
kill off this thinking, its starting to sink in.
i am losing control now without you i can finally see.

run away, run away, i will attack.
run away, run away, go chase yourself.
run away, run away, now, i will attack.
i will attack, i will aa whoooaaaaaaaaa.

your promises, they look like lies.
your honesty, like a back that hides a knifeknife.
i promise you promise you.
i promise you promise you, promise you.
that i am finally free.

run away, run away, i will attack.
run away, run away, go chase yourself.
run away, run away, now i will attack.
i will attack, i will attack, i will attack.

run away, i will attack, i will attack.
run away, i will attack, i will attack.
run away, i will attack, i will attack.
run away, now, i will attack, i will attack, i will aa whoooaaaaaaaaa.

your promises.
promises, promises.
i promise you.
promise you.
i promise you.
promise you, promise you.
