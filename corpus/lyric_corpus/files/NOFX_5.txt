this is not a test of the emergency broadcast system, this is a real thing!

kick back watch it crumble.
see the drowning, watch the fall.
i feel just terrible about it.
thats sarcasm, let it burn!

i am gonna make a toast when it falls apart.
i am gonna raise my glass above my heart.
then someone shouts, thats what they get.
for all the the years of hit and run.
for all the piss broke bands on vh 1.
where did all their money go?
do not we all know?
parasitic music industry.
as it destroys itself.
we will show them how its supposed to be.

music written from devotion.
not ambition, not for fame.
zero people are exploited.
there are no tricks, up our sleeve.

were gonna fight against the mass appeal.
were gonna kill the seven record deal.
make records that have more than one good song.
the dinosaurs will slowly die.
and i do believe no one will cry.
i am just fucking glad i am gonna be.
there to watch the fall!
pre historic music industry.
three feet in la brea tar.
extinction never felt so good.

if you think anyone will feel badly.
you are sadly, mistaken.
time has come for evolution.
fuck collusion, kill by five.
whatever happened to the handshake.
whatever happened to deals no one would break.
what happened to, integrity.
its still there, it always was.
for playing music just because.
a million reasons why.
all dinosaurs will die.
all dinosaurs will die.
all dinosaurs will die..
