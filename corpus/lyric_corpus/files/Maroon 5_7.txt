now as the summer fades.
i let you slip away.
you say i am not your type.
but i can make you sway.

it makes you burn to learn.
you are not the only one.
i let you be.
if you put down your blazing gun.

now you have gone somewhere else.
far away.
i do not know if i will find you find you, find you.
but you feel my breath.
on your neck.
believe i am right behind you.

cause you keep me coming back for more.
and i feel a little better than i did before.
and if i never see your face again.
i mind.
cause we got much further than i thought wed get tonight.

sometimes you move so well.
its hard not to give in.
i am lost, i can not tell.
where you end and i begin.

it makes me burn to learn.
you are with another man.
i wonder if hes half.
the lover that i am.
now you have gone somewhere else.
far away.

i do not know if i will find you.
but you feel my breath.
on your neck.
ca not believe i am right behind you.

cause you keep me coming back for more.
and i feel a little better than i did before.
and if i never see your face again.
i mind.
cause we got much further than i thought wed get tonight.

baby, baby.
please believe me.
find it in your heart to reach me.
promise not to leave me behind.
promise not to leave me behind.

take me back, but take it easy.
make me think but do not deceive me.
torture me by taking your time.
torture me, torture me.

cause you keep me coming back for more.
and i feel a little better than i did before.
and if i never see your face again.
i mind.
cause we got much further than i thought wed get tonight torture me, torture me.

cause you keep me coming back for more.
and i feel a little better than i did before.
and if i never see your face again.
i mind.
cause we got much further than i thought wed get tonight..
