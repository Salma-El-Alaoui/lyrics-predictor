measuring a summers day.
i only find it slips away to grey.
the hours, they bring me pain.

tangerine, tangerine.
living reflections from a dream.
i was her love, she was my queen.
and now a thousand years between.

thinking how it used to be.
does she still remember times like these?
to think of us again, and i do.

tangerine, tangerine.
living reflections from a dream.
i was her love, she was my queen.
and now a thousand years between.
