just do something to tell you who i am, ya know?

chorus x2.
its high voltage you can not shake the shock.
because nobody wants it to stop, check it out.
its high voltage you can not shake the shock.
because nobody wants it to stop, check it out.

i have been digging in the crates.
ever since i was living in space.
before the rat race.
before monkeys had human traits.
mastered numerology.
and bigbang theology.
performed lobotomies.
with telekinetic psychology.
invented the mic.
so i could start blessin it.
and chincheckin kids to make my point.
like an impressionist.
many men have tried to shake us.
but i will twist my cords.
through double helixes.
and show them what i am made of.
i buckle knees like leg braces.
cast the spell of instrumental ness.
and all of the emcees that hate us.
so try on.
leave you without a shoulder to cry on.
from now to infinity.
let icons be bygones.
i fire bomb.
ghostly notes haunt this.
i have tried threats.
but moved on to a promise.
i stomp shit.
with or without an accomplice.
mix media.
the stamp of approval is on this.

chorus.

akira.
put a kink in the backbones.
of clones with microphones.
never satisfy my rhyme jones.
spraying bright day.
over what you might say.
blood type krylon technicolor type a.
on highways write with road rage.
on pages of wind.
and cages of tin.
that bounce all around.
surround sound.
devouring the scene.
subliminal gangrene paintings.
overall the same things.
sing song karaoke copy madness.
break bones verbally.
with sticks and stone tactics.
fourth dimension.
combat convention.
write rhymes at ease.
while the tracks stand at attention.
attention.
meant to put you away.
with the pencil, pistol, official.
16 line rhyme missile.
while you risk your all.
i pick out of your flaws.
spin, rah blah blah blah.
you can say you saw.
