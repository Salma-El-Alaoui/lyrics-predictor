filled with a love for learning, yentl has.
no choice after her father dies but to disguise.
herself as a man, so that she can pursue all.
her sweet imagined possibilities. her.
journey begins...

prayer.
god   our heavenly father.
oh, god   and my father.
who is also in heaven.
may the light.
of this flickering candle.
illuminate the night the way.
your spirit illuminates my soul.

papa, can you hear me?
papa, can you see me?
papa, can you find me in the night?

papa, are you near me?
papa, can you hear me?
papa, can you help me not be frightened?

looking at the skies.
i seem to see a million eyes.
which ones are yours?
where are you now that yesterday.
has waved goodbye.
and closed its doors?
the night is so much darker.
the wind is so much colder.

the world i see is so much bigger now that i am alone.

papa, please forgive me.
try to understand me.
papa, do not you know i had no choice?

can you hear me praying.
anything i am saying.
even though the night is filled with voices?

i remember evrything you taught me.
evry book i have ever read.
can all the words in all the books.
help me to face what lies ahead?
the trees are so much taller.
and i feel so much smaller.
the moon is twice as lonely.
and the stars are half as bright.

papa, how i love you.
papa, how i need you.
papa, how i miss you.
kissing me goodnight..
