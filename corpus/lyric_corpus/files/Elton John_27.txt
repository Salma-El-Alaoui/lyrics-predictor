who will walk me down to church when i am sixty years of age.
when the ragged dog they gave me has been ten years in the grave.
and seorita play guitar, play it just for you.
my rosary has broken and my beads have all slipped through.

you have hung up your great coat and you have laid down your gun.
you know the war you fought in was not too much fun.
and the future you are giving me holds nothing for a gun.
i have no wish to be living sixty years on.

yes i will sit with you and talk let your eyes relive again.
i know my vintage prayers would be very much the same.
and magdelena plays the organ, plays it just for you.
your choral lamp that burns so low when you are passing through.

and the future you are giving me holds nothing for a gun.
i have no wish to be living sixty years on.
