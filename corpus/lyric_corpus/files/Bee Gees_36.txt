i could not figure why.
you could not give me what everybody needs.
i should not let you kick me when i am down.
my baby.
i find out everybody know that.
you have been using me.
i am surprised you.
let me stay around you.
one day i am gonna lift the cover.
and look inside your heart.
we gotta level before we go.
and tear this love apart.

theres no fight you can not fight.
this battle of love with me.
you win again.
so little time.
we do nothing but compete.
theres no life on earth.
no other could see me through.
you win again.
some never try.
but if anybody can, we can.
and i will be, i will be.
following you.

oh baby i shake you from now on.
i am gonna break down your defenses.
one by one.
i am gonna hit you from all sides.
lay your fortress open wide.
nobody stops this body from.
taking you.

you better beware, i swear.
i am gonna be there one day when you fall.
i could never let you cast aside.
the greatest love of all.

theres no fight you can not fight.
this battle of love with me.
you win again.
so little time.
we do nothing but compete.
theres no life on earth.
no other could see me through.
you win again.
some never try.
but if anybody can, we can.
and i will be, i will be.
following you.
