shed my skin since you came in.
where do you end and i begin?
awoke my senses yet you stopped time.
you took me to a deeper high.
the essence of my hopes and fears.
creation of my muddled dreams.

cowboy style.
with a peaceful smile.
you are from the temple will not you stay a while.

found my voice to have my say.
you take me close to far away.
and now i find and now i feel.
the ordinary is surreal.
peace and terror all in one.
my future life has just begun.

cowboy style.
with a peaceful smile.
you are from the temple will not you stay a while x2.

will not you stay a while.

i am frightened i am aroused.
i am enlightened to the now.

cowboy style x2.

cowboy style.
with a peaceful smile.
you are from the temple will not you stay a while.
