i am back.
i am back in the saddle again.
i am back.
i am back in the saddle again.

riding into town alone by the light of the moon.
i am looking for old sukie jones she crazy horse saloon.
barkeep gimme a drink thats when she caught my eye.
she turned to give me a wink that make a grown man cry.

i am back in the saddle again.
i am back.
i am back in the saddle again.
i am back.

come easy, go easy, all right till the rising sun.
i am calling all the shots tonight i am like a loaded gun.
peeling off my boots and chaps i am saddle sore.
four bits gets you time in the racks i scream for more.
fools gold out of their mines the girls are soaking wet.
no tongues drier than mine i will come when i get back.

i am back in the saddle again.
i am back.
i am back in the saddle again.

i am riding, i am loading up my pistol.
i am riding, i really got a fistful.
i am riding, i am shining up my saddle.
i am riding, this snake is gonna rattle.

i am back in the saddle again.
i am back.
i am back in the saddle again.
i am back.

riding high.
riding high.
riding high.
already.
