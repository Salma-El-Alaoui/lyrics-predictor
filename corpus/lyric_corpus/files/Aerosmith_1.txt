i kept the right ones out.
and let the wrong ones in.
had an angel of mercy to see me through all my sins.
and there were times in my life.
when i was going insane.
trying to walk through.
the pain.

when i lost my grip.
and i hit the floor.
yeah, i thought i could leave, but could not get out the door.
i was so sick and tired.
of living a lie.
i was wishing that i.
would die.

its amazing.
with the blink of an eye, you finally see the light.
ohh, its amazing.
when the moment arrives that you know you will be alright.
yeah, its amazing.
and i am saying a prayer for the desperate hearts tonight.

that one last shots a permanent vacation.
and how high can you fly with broken wings?
lifes a journey not a destination.
and i just can not tell just what tomorrow brings.

you have to learn to crawl.
before you learn to walk.
but i just could not listen to all that righteous talk, oh yeah.
i was out on the street.
just trying to survive.
scratching to stay.
alive.

its amazing.
with the blink of an eye, you finally see the light.
ohh, its amazing.
when the moment arrives that you know you will be alright.
ohh, its amazing.
and i am saying a prayer for the desperate hearts tonight.
the desperate hearts.
desperate hearts.
