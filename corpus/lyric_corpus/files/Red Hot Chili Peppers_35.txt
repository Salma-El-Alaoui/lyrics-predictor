flat on my back.
in a lonely sprawl.
i stare at the ceiling.
cause i can not fall.
asleep tonight.
no not at all.
head lights flash.
across my bedroom wall.
crying eyes open.
cause i can not fall.
in love with you.
no not at all.

walk away and taste the pain.
come again some other day.
are not you glad you were not afraid.
funny how the price gets paid.

busted in two.
like a brittle stick.
i can not drink.
because my throat constricts.
lovesick from you.
that will never do.
open my mouth.
i could not make a sound.
i could not scream.
no.
i could not shout.
it out to you.
nothing to do.

walk away and taste the pain.
come again some other day.
are not you glad you were not afraid.
funny how the price gets paid.

walk away and taste the pain.

this may come as a shocking surprise.
i have to take a walk.
i have to kiss it goodbye.
goodbye my love.
goodbye my love.
i am not alive.

walk away and taste the pain.
come again some other day.
are not you glad you were not afraid.
funny how the price gets paid.
