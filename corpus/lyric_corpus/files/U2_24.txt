its falling, its falling.
and outside a building comes tumbling down.
and inside a child on the ground.
says he will do it again.

and what am i to do?
what in the world am i to say?
theres nothing else to do.
he says he will change the world some day.
i rejoice.

this morning i fell out of bed.
when i woke up to what he had said.
everythings crazy but i am too lazy to lie.

and what am i to do?
just tell me what am i supposed to say?
i can not change the world.
but i can change the world in me.
rejoice.
rejoice.

and what am i to do?
just tell me what am i supposed to say?
i can not change the world.
but i can change the world in me.

i rejoice..
