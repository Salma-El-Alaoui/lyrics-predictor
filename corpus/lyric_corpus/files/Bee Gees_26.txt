i cried for you, i cried for you.
i cried for two, i lied for you.

saved by the bell on your own carousel.
now who can tell, if you will love that man as well.
now i will walk down our great lane.

i died for you, i died for two.
i will live for you, i will give to you.

saved by the bell on your own carousel.
now who can tell, if you will love that man as well.
now i will walk down our great lane.
now i will walk down our great lane.
now i will walk down our great lane.
