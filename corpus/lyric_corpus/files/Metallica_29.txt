i can not remember anything.
ca not tell if this is true or a dream.
deep down inside i feel to scream.
this terrible silence stops with me.

now that the war is through with me.
i am waking up, i cannot see.
that theres not much left of me.
nothing is real but pain now.

hold my breath as i wish for death.
oh please god, wake me.

back in the womb its much too real.
in pumps life that i must feel.
but can not look forward to reveal.
look to the time when i will live.
fed through the tube that sticks in me.
just like a wartime novelty.
tied to machines that make me be.
cut this life off from me.

hold my breath as i wish for death.
oh please god, wake me.

now the world is gone i am just one.
oh god help me.
hold my breath as i wish for death.
oh please god, help me.

darkness.
imprisoning me.
all that i see.
absolute horror.
i cannot live.
i cannot die.
trapped in myself.
body my holding cell.

landmine has taken my sight.
taken my speech.
taken my hearing.
taken my arms.
taken my legs.
taken my soul.
left me with life in hell.
