once upon a time in a land called fantasy.
17 mountains stood so high.
the sea surrounded them and together they would be.
the only thing that ever made u cry.
u said the devil told u that another mountain would appear.
everytime somebody broke your heart.
he said the sea would 1 day overflow with all your tears.
and love will always leave u lonely.

but i say its only mountains and the sea.
love will conquer if u just believe oh yeah.
its only mountains and the sea.
theres nothing greater, u and me.

once upon a time in a haystack of despair.
happiness sometimes hard 2 find. yeah.
africa divided, hijack in the air.
its enough to make you want to lose your mind.

but i say its only mountains and the sea.
love will conquer if u just believe oh yeah.
its only mountains and the sea.
theres nothing greater, u and me.

guitars and drums on the 1.

bobby on the drum   ah!

its only mountains oh yeah and the sea. and the girls sing.
theres nothing greater, u and me.

starvation.

mountains.
