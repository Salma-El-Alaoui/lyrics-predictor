please take me by the hand.
its so cold out tonight, i will.
put blankets on the bed.
i will not turn out the light, just.
do not forget to.
think about me, and i.
will not forget you.
ampquoti will write you once a week,ampquot she said.

why does it feel the same.
to fall in love or break it off?
and if young love is just a game, then.
i must have missed the kick off.
do not depend on me to.
ever follow through on.
anything but.
id go through hell for you and.

i have not been this scared.
in a long time.
and i am so unprepared.
so heres your valentine.
bouquet of clumsy words.
a simple melody.
this worlds an ugly place.
but you are so beautiful to me.

i will think about the times.
she kissed me after class and.
she put up with my friends.
i acted like an ass, i.
ditched my lecture.
to watch the girls play soccer.
is my picture.
still hanging in her locker?

i have not been this scared.
in a long time.
and i am so unprepared.
so heres your valentine.
bouquet of clumsy words.
a simple melody.
this worlds an ugly place.
but you are so beautiful...
