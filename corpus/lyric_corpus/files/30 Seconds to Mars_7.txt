so i run and hide and tear myself up.
start again with a brand new name.
and eyes that see into infinity.

i will disappear.
i told you once and i will say it again.
i want my message read clear.
i will show you the way, the way i am going.

so i run and hide and tear myself up.
start again with a brand new name.
and eyes that see into infinity.

i was almost there.
just a moment away from becoming unclear.
ever get the feeling you are gone?
i will show you the way, the way i am going.

so i run and hide and tear myself up.
start again with a brand new name.
and eyes that see into infinity into infinity.

so i run, start again.
with a brand new name.
with a brand new name.

so i run and hide and tear myself so i run.
start again with a brand new name start again.
and eyes that see into infinity with a brand new name.

i will disappear.
