would not it be nice if we were older.
then we would not have to wait so long.
and would not it be nice to live together.
in the kind of world where we belong.

you know its gonna make it that much better.
when we can say goodnight and stay together.

would not it be nice if we could wake up.
in the morning when the day is new.
and after having spent the day together.
hold each other close the whole night through.

happy times together we have been spending.
i wish that every kiss was neverending.
oh would not it be nice.

maybe if we think and wish and hope and pray it might come true.
baby then there would not be a single thing we could not do.
we could be married we could be married.
and then wed be happy then wed be happy.

would not it be nice.

you know it seems the more we talk about it.
it only makes it worse to live without it.
but lets talk about it.
would not it be nice.

good night.
sleep tight.

good night.
sleep tight.

good night.
sleep tight.
