swaying room as the music starts.
strangers making the most of the dark.
two by two their bodies become one.

i see you through the smokey air.
cant you feel the weight of my stare.
youre so close,but still a world away.
what im dying to say is that.

chorus.
im crazy for you.
touch me once and you know its true.
i never wanted anyone like this.
its all brand new.
youll feel it in my kiss.
im crazy for you.
crazy for you.

trying hard to control my heart.
i walk over to where you are.
eye to eye we meet no words at all.

slowly now we begin to move.
every breth im deeper into you.
soon we too are standing still in time.
if you read my mind.
you see.

chorusrepeat.
