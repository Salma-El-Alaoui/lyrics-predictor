he was a most peculiar man.
thats what mrs. reardon says and she should know.
she lived upstairs from him.
she said he was a most peculiar man.

he was a most peculiar man.
he lived all alone within a house.
within a room within himself.
a most peculiar man.

he had no friends he seldom spoke.
and no one in turn ever spoke to him.
cause he was not friendly and he did not care.
and he was not like them.
oh no, he was a most peculiar man.

he died last saturday.
he turned on the gas and he went to sleep.
with the windows closed so hed never wake up.
to his silent world and his tiny room.

and mrs. reardon says he has a brother somewhere.
who should be notified soon.
and all the people said what a shame that hes dead.
but was not he a most peculiar man?
