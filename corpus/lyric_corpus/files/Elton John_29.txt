welcome to my christmas song.
id like to thank you for the year.
so i am sending you this christmas card.
to say its nice to have you here.
id like to sing about all the things.
your eyes and mind can see.
so hop aboard the turntable.
oh step into christmas with me.

chorus.
step into christmas.
let us join together.
we can watch the snow fall forever and ever.
eat, drink and be merry.
come along with me.
step into christmas.
the admissions free.

take care in all you do next year.
and keep smiling through the days.
if we can help to entertain you.
oh we will find the ways.
so merry christmas one and all.
theres no place id rather be.
than asking you if youd oblige.
stepping into christmas with me.

chorus.
