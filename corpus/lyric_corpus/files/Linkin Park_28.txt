part of me will not go away.
everyday reminded how much i hate it.
weighted against the consequences.
ca not live without it so its senseless.
wanna cut it out of my soul.
and just live with a gaping hole.
take control of my life.
and wash out all the burnt taste.
i made the problems in the first place.
hang my head low cause its part of me.
you hardly see right next to the heart of me.
hurting me, the routine scar.
new cuts cover where the old ones are.
and i am sick of this.
i can not stand the sandpaper thoughts that grate on my sanity.
i rather not even be then the man.
thats staring in the mirror through me.

cut myself free willingly.
stop just whats killing me.
cut myself free willingly.
stop just whats killing me.
cut myself free willingly.
stop just whats killing me.
cut myself free willingly.
stop just whats killing me.

i feel it everyday.
i feel i made my way.
i feel it swell up inside, swell up inside.
swallowing me.

freedom can be frightening if you have never felt it.
once its been dealt with you.
feel like you have been touched by something angelic.
and then melted down into a pool of peace.
cease to be the animal you used to be.
remove the broken parts you know were wrong.
and feel the calm when the problems all gone.
and then you start to see another piece of yourself.
that you can not let be.
and that reason will last fight to free yourself.
take it to the depths of the bottom of the well.
and now you know you can choose.
to lose the part in your heart.
where your insides bruise.
you can live if you are willing to.
put a stop to just whats killing you.

cut myself free willingly.
stop just whats killing me.
cut myself free willingly.
stop just whats killing me.
cut myself free willingly.
stop just whats killing me.
cut myself free willingly.
stop just whats killing me.

i feel it everyday.
i feel i made my way.
i feel it swell up inside, swell up inside.
swallowing me.

alive in me, inside of me, a part of me screams away silently.
this part of me will not go away, part of me will not go away.

everywhere i look around i see how everyone aught to be.
every time i see myself.
theres always something wrong with me.

i feel it everyday.
i feel i made my way.
i feel it swell up inside, swell up inside.
swallowing me.
i feel it everyday.
i feel i made my way.
i feel it swell up inside, swell up inside.
swallowing me.

i feel it swell up inside, swell up inside, swallowing me.
i feel it swell up inside, swell up inside, swallowing me.
