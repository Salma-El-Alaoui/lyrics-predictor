disenchanted lullabies.
sing me yours, i will sing you mine.
sing with me now whats a boy to do?
whats a boy to do?

sing along for yesterday.
sing along my soul to take.
sing along another song for you.
whats a boy to do?

i may be scattered.
a little shattered.
what does it matter?
no one has a fit like i do.

i may be scattered.
a little shattered.
what does it matter?
no one has a fit like i do.
i am the only one that fits you.

whisper with me pass the time.
whisper for the days gone by.
whisper with the voice inside of you.

with this ring you will be mine.
with this ring i will multiply.
with this ring surrendering to you.
whats a boy to do?
