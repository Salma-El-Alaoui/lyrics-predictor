sitting on a castle.
on the floor with esmorelda.
waiting for the geezer.
captain crunch to come around.
feeling suicidal.
coz of certain situations.
hanging from the stairs.
too long.
i think i am coming down.

its time to crash.
losing my mind, losing my mind, losing my mind.
yeah its time to crash.

doing tons of coke and blow.
stuffing it in every hole.
miles high so am i.
watching jimi kiss the sky.
salle diner becomes a blur.
with everybody jamming.
republicans begin to sin.
the batwings start a slamming.

its time to crash.
losing my mind, losing my mind, losing my mind.
maybe its a little late but its time to crash.

you drive me crazy.

captain billy beemish.
put a lamb up on a rack.
thanks for coming billy.
and we hop you are coming back.
the castle will be waiting.
for next bangers and mash.
blanche and marsha reznick.
put their marmite with their hash.

its time to crash.
losing my mind, losing my mind, losing my mind.
yeah its time to crash.
