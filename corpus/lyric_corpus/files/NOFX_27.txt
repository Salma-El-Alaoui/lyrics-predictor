reeko, try to understand, it really is that bad.
it will not just go away, the partys over.
its past two oclock, so its about time we.
stopped, cause i.
see the keg has been sucked dry.
the cisco was emptied into the aquarium.
where the fish all seem to play the ex lax lines.
the dog bowl.
the toilet us overflowed, we are had our fun so.
now theres nothing left to damage.
we got no place left to go.
mr. president please understand, it really is that bad.
it will not just go away, its just beginning.
the ballots have been cast, we make like seaward rats.
leave this sinking ship, leave and not look back.
the things we never tried to disallow.
have come back to haunt us now.
with apple pie and chevrolet.
we have come to see the end, we all made this bed.
now we got nowhere to lay.
dies and gentlemen.
try to understand.
