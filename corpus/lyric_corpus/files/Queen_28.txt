theres no time for us.
theres no place for us.
what is this thing that builds our dreams.
yet slips away from us.

who wants to live forever?
who wants to live forever?

theres no chance for us.
its all decided for us.
this world has only one sweet moment.
set aside for us.

who wants to live forever?
who wants to live forever?

who dares to love forever?
when love must die.

but touch my tears with your lips.
touch my world with your fingertips.
and we can have forever.
and we can love forever.
forever is our today.

who wants to live forever?
who wants to live forever?
forever is our today.

who waits forever anyway?
