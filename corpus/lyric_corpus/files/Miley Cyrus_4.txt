cause i do not.
my problem is not that i kissed you.
woah, oh.

i figured out.
that you are nothing that i thought you are about.
you are just caught in aplce.
its what time will erase in my heart.

you are my type of guy i guess.
if i was stuck in east northumberland high.
for the rest of my life.
but people change.
thank god i did.

just because i liked you back then.
it does not mean i like you now.
just because i liked you back then.

your problems not lack of trying.
cause you do.
its just that you are at your best when you are lying.
woah, oh.

and saying things you think i wanted to hear.
but you got it all wrong.
i have already moved on, my dear.

you are my type of guy i guess.
if i was stuck in east northumberland high.

it does not mean i like you.

when you are standing near me.
i do not see so clearly.
the feelings are still helpable.
but when i take two steps away.
it takes some light on my day.

yeah, you can not go back.
its all in the past.
guess you gotta laugh at it.

you are my type of guy i guess.
if i was stuck in east northumberland high.
for the rest of my life.
but people change.
