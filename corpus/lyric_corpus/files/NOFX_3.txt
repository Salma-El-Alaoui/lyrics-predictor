you know it when its over.
doors are closing feel the.
sober staring at you.
you better take.
one last good look.
one more round and.
its bottles to the.
ground smashing.
of the glass what a supersonic sound.
you gotta pull the.
plug when its time.
to die bottles to.
the ground.
theres a suitcase.
on the sidewalk.
theres a record in.
a milkcrate, she will be.
staying you will be.
trowing wiskey.
over one lip.
one more round.
then its bottle.
to the ground.
smasing of the.
glass a perfect.
imperfect sound.
you gotta pay the.
piper when the rats.
are gone whoa whoa.
all bottles.
to the ground.
