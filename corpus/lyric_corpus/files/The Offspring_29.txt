i believe that realitys gone.
disillusions real.
i believe that moralitys gone.
and theres nothing to feel.
if you take the sacred things.
the things that we hold dear.
empty promise is all you will find.
so give me something.
something to believe in.

i believe in a changing of the guard.
put our feet on the ground.
see it happen in your own backyard.
everything breaks down.
do you accept what you are told.
without even thinking.
throw it all and make your own.
and give me something.
something to believe in.

where they lead.
you will follow.
well i guess thats just the way it goes.
and if you look away.
you will be doing what they say.
and if you look alive.
you will be singled out and tried.
if you take home anything.
let it be your will to think.
the more cynical you become.
the better off you will be.
