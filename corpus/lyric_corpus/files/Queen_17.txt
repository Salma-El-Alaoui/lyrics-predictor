love of my life   you have hurt me.
you have broken my heart and now you leave me.
love of my life can not you see.
bring it back, bring it back.
do not take it away from me, because you do not know  .
what it means to me.

love of my life, do not leave me.
you have taken my love, you now desert me.
love of my life can not you see.
bring it back, bring it back.
do not take it away from me because you do not know  .
what it means to me.

you will remember .
when this is blown over.
and everythings all by the way.
when i grow older.
i will be there at your side to remind you.
how i still love you   i still love you.

back   hurry back.
please bring it back home to me.
because you do not know what it means to me  .
love of my life.
love of my life....
