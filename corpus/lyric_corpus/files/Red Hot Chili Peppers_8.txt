ca not stop addicted to the shin dig.
chop top he says i am gonna win big.
choose not a life of imitation.
distant cousin to the reservation.
defunct the pistol that you pay for.
this punk the feeling that you stay for.
in time i want to be your best friend.
eastside love is living on the westend.
knock out but boy you better come to.
do not die you know the truth is some do.
go write your message on the pavement.
burning so bright i wonder what the wave meant.
white heat is screaming in the jungle.
complete the motion if you stumble.
go ask the dust for any answers.
come back strong with 50 belly dancers.

the world i love.
the tears i drop.
to be part of.
the wave can not stop.
ever wonder if its all for you.
the world i love.
the trains i hop.
to be part of.
the wave can not stop.
come and tell me when its time to.

sweetheart is bleeding in the snowcone.
so smart shes leading me to ozone.
music the great communicator.
use two sticks to make it in the nature.
i will get you into penetration.
the gender of a generation.
the birth of every other nation.
worth your weight the gold of meditation.
this chapters going to be a close one.
smoke rings i know you are going to blow one.
all on a spaceship persevering.
use my hands for everything but steering.
ca not stop the spirits when they need you.
mop tops are happy when they feed you.
j. butterfly is in the treetop.
birds that blow the meaning into bebop.

the world i love.
the tears i drop.
to be part of.
the wave can not stop.
ever wonder if its all for you.
the world i love.
the trains i hop.
to be part of.
the wave can not stop.
come and tell me when its time to.

wait a minute i am passing out.
win or lose just like you.
far more shocking.
than anything i ever knew.
how about you.
ten more reasons.
why i need somebody new just like you.
far more shocking than anything i ever knew.
right on cue.

ca not stop addicted to the shin dig.
chop top he says i am gonna win big.
choose not a life of imitation.
distant cousin to the reservation.
defunkt the pistol that you pay for.
this punk the feeling that you stay for.
in time i want to be your best friend.
eastside love is living on the westend.
knock out but boy you better come to.
do not die you know the truth is some do.
go write your message on the pavement.
burning so bright i wonder what the wave meant.

kick start the golden generator.
sweet talk but do not intimidate her.
ca not stop the gods from engineering.
feel no need for any interfering.
your image in the dictionary.
this life is more than ordinary.
can i get two maybe even three of these.
coming from space.
to teach you of the pleiades.
ca not stop the spirits when they need you.
this life is more than just a read through.
