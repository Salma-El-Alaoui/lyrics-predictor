when i am at the pearly gates.
this will be on my videotape, my videotape.
mephistopheles is just beneath.
and hes reaching up to grab me.

this is one for the good old days.
and i have it all here.
in red, blue, green.
red, blue, green.

you are my centre when i spin away.
out of control.
on videotape.
on videotape.
on videotape.
on videotape.
on videotape.
on videotape.

this is my way of saying goodbye.
because i can not do it face to face.
i am talking to you before...

no matter what happens now.
you should not be afraid.
because i know today has been the most perfect day i have ever seen.
