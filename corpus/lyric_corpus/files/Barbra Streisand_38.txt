you do not bring me flowers.
you do not sing me love songs.

you hardly talk to me anymore.
when i come through the door at the end of the day...

i remember when you could not wait to love me.
used to hate to leave me.
now after loving me late at night.

when its good for you, babe.
and you are feeling all right.

when you just roll over and turn out the light...
and you do not bring me flowers anymore.

it used to be so natural.

it used to be...

to talk about forever.

mmm...

but used to bes do not count anymore.
they just lay on the floor.
till we sweep them away.
barbara.
and baby i remember all the things you taught me.

i learned how to laugh and i learned how to cry.

well, i learned how to love and i learned how to lie.

so you think i could learn how to tell you goodbye.

so you think i could learn how to tell you goodbye.
you do not bring me flowers any more...

well, you think i could learn how to tell you goodbye...

?cause you don?t say you need me.

you do not sing me love songs.

you do not bring me flowers anymore....
