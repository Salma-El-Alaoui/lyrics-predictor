you could never know what its like.
your blood like winter freezes just like ice.
and theres a cold and lonely light that shines from you.
you will wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use.

and did you think this fool could never win.
well look at me, i am coming back again.
i got a taste of love in a simple way.
and if you need to know while i am still standing you just fade away.

do not you know i am still standing better than i ever did.
looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid.
i am still standing after all this time.
picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind.

i am still standing yeah yeah yeah.
i am still standing yeah yeah yeah.

once i never could hope to win.
you starting down the road leaving me again.
the threats you made were meant to cut me down.
and if our love was just a circus youd be a clown by now.

y know, i am still standing better than i ever did.
looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid.
i am still standing after all this time.
picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind.

i am still standing yeah yeah yeah.
i am still standing yeah yeah yeah.

solo.

do not you know that i am still standing better than i ever did.
looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid.
i am still standing after all this time.
picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind.

i am still standing yeah yeah yeah.
i am still standing yeah yeah yeah.
i am still standing yeah yeah yeah.
i am still standing yeah yeah yeah.
fade.
