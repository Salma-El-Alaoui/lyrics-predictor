i.o.i.o.

you know i love getting up in the morning.
when the sun first strikes the trees.
all the morning birds that sing above.
still bring back memories.
of a girl who stood beside me.
when the rights i did were wrong.
but she went back down the river.
just when i thought i could be strong.
when i thought i could be strong, so i sing.

i.o.i.o.

she never told me why she left me.
but the letter said goodbye.
now my mornings are for wondring.
and my nights to reason why.
why a stranger comes to steal the love.
of a girl i had to hold.
but she went back down the river.
just when i thought i could be strong.
when i thought i could be strong, so i sing.

i.o.i.o..
