what i dream i had.
pressed in organdy.
clothed in crinoline of smoky burgundy.
softer than the rain.
i wandered empty streets.
down past the shop displays.
i heard cathedral bells.
tripping down the alley ways.
as i walked on.

and when you ran to me.
your cheeks flushed with the night.
we walked on frosted fields of juniper and lamplight.
i held your hand.
and when i awoke and felt you warm and near.
i kissed your honey hair with my grateful tears.
oh i love you, girl.
oh, i love you..
