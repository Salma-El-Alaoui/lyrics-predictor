a blackened wick is what remains.

the flame was blown out just recently.

although the candle had not burned down to the stick.

it will not be lit again, the day will not be so bright.

we do not know what she may have been.

all we know is what she left behind.

an apartment cluttered with childrens toys.

photos of good times.

in the bedroom, theres sheets on the windows.

theres a four poster bed for a reason.

theres a box on the floor full of secrets.

it will not be opened.

here older boys and girls would play.

all inhibitions were left behind.

as the door would close, her face began to shine.

this was her finest hour, this was her finest time.

now, shes gone, and its not gonna be alright, not for me.

shes gone, but not forgotten, shes still here.

in all those years she touched so many lives.

whos gonna watch the little girl she left behind?

carol anne stands alone in the school yard.

all the other children have gone.

after waiting for hours.

she can not understand why her mother left her sad.

in the darkness she sees definition.

in the silence, she hears someone calling.

after nightmares, she lies in bed screaming.

but theres no reaction.

theres no one listening, theres no one.

now, shes gone, and its never gonna be alright, not for me.

shes gone.
