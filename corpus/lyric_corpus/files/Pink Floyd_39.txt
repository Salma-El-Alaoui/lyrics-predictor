so, so you think you can tell heaven from hell?
blue skies from pain?
can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?
a smile from a veil?
do you think you can tell?

did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts?
hot ashes for trees?
hot air for a cool breeze?
cold comfort for change?
did you exchange a walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?

how i wish, how i wish you were here.
we are just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year.
running over the same old ground.
what have we found?
the same old fears.
wish you were here.
