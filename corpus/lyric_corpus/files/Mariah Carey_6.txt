this is for my peoples who just lost somebody.
your best friend, your baby, your man, or your lady.
put your hand way up high.
we will never say bye no, no, no.
mamas, daddies, sisters, brothers, friends and cousins.
this is for my peoples who lost their grandmothers.
lift your head to the sky cause we will never say bye.

as a child there were them times.
i did not get it but you kept me in line.
i did not know why you did not show up sometimes.
on sunday mornings, and i missed you.
but i am glad we talked through.
all them grown folk things.
separation brings.
you never let me know it.
you never let it show because.
you loved me and obviously.
theres so much more left to say.
if you were with me today face to face.

chorus.
i never knew i could hurt like this.
and everyday life goes on like.
quoti wish i could talk to you for awhilequot.
miss you but i try not to cry.
as time goes by.
and its true that you have reached a better place.
still id give the world to see your face.
and i am right here next to you.
but its like you are gone too soon.
now the hardest thing to do is say bye bye.

bye bye 3x.
bye bye.

and you never got the chance to see how good i have done.
and you never got to see me back at number one.
i wish that you were here to celebrate together.
i wish that we could spend the holidays together.

i remember when you used to tuck me in at night.
with the teddy bear you gave to me that i held so tight.
i thought you were so strong.
youd make it through whatever.
its so hard to accept the fact you are gone forever.

chorus.

bye bye bye bye bye bye 3x.
bye bye.

this is for my peoples who just lost somebody.
your best friend, your baby, your man, or your lady.
put your hand way up high.
we will never say bye no, no, no.
mamas, daddies, sisters, brothers, friends and cousins.
this is for my peoples who lost their grandmothers.
lift your head to the sky cause we will never say bye.
