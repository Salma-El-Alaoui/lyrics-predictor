so unimpressed but so in awe.
such a saint but such a whore.
so self aware so full of shit.
so indecisive so adamant.
i am contemplating thinking about thinking.
its so overrated just get another drink in.
watch me come undone.

they are selling razor blades and mirrors in the street.
i pray that when i am coming down you will be asleep.
if i ever hurt you your revenge will be so sweet.
because i am scum.
and i am your son.
i come undone.
i come undone.

so rock and roll so corporate suit.
so damn ugly, so damn cute.
so well trained, so animal.
so need your love, so fuck you all.
i am not scared of dying i just do not want to.
if i stop lying id just disappoint you.
i come undone.

they are selling razor blades and mirrors in the street.
i pray that when i am coming down you will be asleep.
if i ever hurt you your revenge will be so sweet.
because i am scum.
and i am your son.
i have come undone.

so write another ballad.
mix it on a wednesday.
sell it on a thursday.
buy a yacht by saturday.
its a love song.
a love song.
do another interview.
sing a bunch of lies.
tell about celebrities that i despise.
and sing love songs.
we sing love songs.
so sincere.
so sincere.

they are selling razor blades and mirrors in the street.
pray that when i am coming down you will be asleep.
if i ever hurt you your revenge will be so sweet.
