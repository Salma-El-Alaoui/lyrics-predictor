diamonds and dust.
poor man last, rich man first.
lambourginis, caviar.
dry martinis, shangri la.
i got a burning feeling.
deep inside of me.
its yearning.
but i am going to set it free.

chorus.
i am going in to sin city.
i am gonna win in sin city.
where the lights are bright.
do the town tonight.
i am gonna win in sin city.

i am gonna rule you baby.

ladders and snakes.
ladders give, snakes take.
rich man, poor man, beggarman, thief.
aingt got a hope in hell, thats my belief.

fingers freddy, diamond jim.
they are getting ready, look out i am coming in.
so spin that wheel, cut that pack.
and roll those loaded dice.
bring on the dancing girls.
and put the champaign on ice.

chorus.
