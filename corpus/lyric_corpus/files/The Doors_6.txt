hello.
i love you.
will not you tell me your name.
hello.
i love you.
let me jump in your game.

shes walking down the street.
blind to every eye she meets.
do you think you will be the guy.
to make the queen of the angels sigh.

she holds her head so high.
like a statue in the sky.
her arms are wicked and her legs are long.
when she moves my brain screams out this song.

sidewalk crouches at her feet.
like a dog that begs for something sweet.
do you hope to make her see, you fool.
do you hope to pluck this dusky jewel.
