been thinking about you, your records are here.
your eyes are on my wall, your teeth are over there.
but i am still no one, and you are now a star.
what do you care?

been thinking about you, and theres no rest.
shit i still love you, still see you in bed.
but i am playing with myself, and what do you care.
when the other men are far, far better.

all the things you have got.
all the things you need.
who bought you cigarettes.
who bribed the company to come and see you honey?

i have been thinking about you, so how can you sleep?
these people are not your friends, they are paid to kiss your feet.
they do not know what i know and why should you care.
when i am not there.

been thinking about you, and theres no rest.
should i still love you, still see you in bed.
but i am playing with myself, what do you care.
when i am not there.

all the things you have got.
she will never need.
all the things you have got.
i have bled and i bleed to please you.

been thinking about you.
