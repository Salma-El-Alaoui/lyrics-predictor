songbird sings from the heart.
each word can tear you apart.
i sing you sing along.
you find your life in my song.
when you need the strength to carry on.
you have got me to turn to.
with the songs that i sing.
and the magic they bring.
they have helped you be strong now.
the song sets you free.
but who sings for me.
i am all alone now.
who sings for songbird.

sometimes when i am all alone.
i sing my saddest song.
lonely and no one can see.
this time the song is for me.
i can touch your secret place inside.
and still you do not know me.
with the songs that i sing.
and the magic they bring.
you have learned to be strong now.
my song sets you free.
but who sings for me.
i am all alone now.
where is my songbird.
where is my songbird.
who sings his songs for me.
