back in the garage with my bullshit detector.
carbon monoxide making sure its effective.
people ringing up making offers for my life.
but i just wanna stay in the garage all night.

we are a garage band.
we come from garageland.

meanwhile things are hotting up in the west end alright.
contracts in the offices, groups in the night.
my bumming slumming friends have all got new boots.
an someone just asked me if the group would wear suits.

i do not wanna hear about what the rich are doing.
i do not wanna go to where the rich are going.
they think they are so clever, they think they are so right.
but the truth is only known by guttersnipes.

theres twenty two singers! but one microphone.
back in the garage theres five guitar players.
but one guitar, back in the garage.
complaints! complaints! wot an old bag.
back in the garage ...all night.
