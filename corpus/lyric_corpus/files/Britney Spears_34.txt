your bodys warm but you are not.
you give a little not a lot.
you coup your love until we kiss.
you are all i want but not like this.

i am watching you disappear.
but you, you were never here.

its only your shadow, never yourself.
its only your shadow, nobody else.
its only your shadow, filling the room.
arriving too late, and leaving too soon.
and leaving too soon...

your body gives but then holds back.
the sun is bright, the sky is black.
can only be another sign.
i cannot keep what is not mine.

you left and it lingers on.
but you, you were almost gone.

its only your shadow, never yourself.
its only your shadow, nobody else.
its only your shadow, filling the room.
arriving too late, and leaving too soon.
and leaving too soon...

i cannot tell if you mean what you say.
you say it so loud, but you sound far away.
maybe i had just a glimpse of your soul.
or was that your shadow i saw on the wall.

i am watching you disappear.
but you, you were never here.

its only your shadow, never yourself.
its only your shadow, nobody else.
its only your shadow, filling the room.
arriving too late.
no, no, no.
its only your shadow.
its only your shadow, nobody else.
its only your shadow.
arriving too late and leaving too soon.

its only your shadow.
