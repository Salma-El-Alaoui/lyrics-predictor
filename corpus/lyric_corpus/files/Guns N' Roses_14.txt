he lost his mind today.
he left it out back on the highway.
on 65.

she loved him yesterday.
yesterdays over.
i said okay.
thats all right.
time moves on.
thats the way.
we live an hope to see the next day.
thats all right.

sometimes these things they are so easy.
sometimes these things they are so cold.
sometimes these things just seem to rip you right in two.
oh no man do not let em get ta you.

she loved him yesterday.
he fucked her sister.
she said o.k.
an thats all right.
buried her things today.
way back out deep.
behind the driveway.
and thats all right.

sometimes these women are so easy.
sometimes these women are so cold.
sometimes these women seem to rip you right in two.
only if you let em get to you.

ya get out on your own.
and you take all that you own.
and you forget about your home.
and then you are just fucking gone.

theres no logic here today.
do as you got to, go your own way.
i said thats right.
times short your lifes your own.
and in the end.
we are just.

dust n bones.
