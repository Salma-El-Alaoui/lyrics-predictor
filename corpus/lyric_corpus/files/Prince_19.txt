i never meant to cause you any sorrow.
i never meant to cause you any pain.
i only wanted one time to see you laughing.
i only want to see you laughing in the purple rain.
purple rain, purple rain.
purple rain, purple rain.
purple rain, purple rain.
i only want to see you bathing in the purple rain.

i never wanted to be your weekend lover.
i only wanted to be some kind of friend.
baby i could never steal you from another.
its such a shame our friendship had to end.
purple rain, purple rain.
purple rain, purple rain.
purple rain, purple rain.
i only want to see you underneath the purple rain.
honey, i know, i know, i know times are changing.
its time we all reach out for something new, that means you too.
you say you want a leader.
but you can not seem to make up your mind.
i think you better close it.
and let me guide you into the purple rain.
purple rain, purple rain.
purple rain, purple rain.
purple rain, purple rain.
i only want to see you, only want to see you.
in the purple rain.
