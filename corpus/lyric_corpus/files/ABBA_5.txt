chiquitita, tell me whats wrong.
you are enchained by your own sorrow.
in your eyes there is no hope for tomorrow.
how i hate to see you like this.
there is no way you can deny it.
i can see that you are oh so sad, so quiet.

chiquitita, tell me the truth.
i am a shoulder you can cry on.
your best friend, i am the one you must rely on.
you were always sure of yourself.
now i see you have broken a feather.
i hope we can patch it up together.

chiquitita, you and i know.
how the heartaches come and they go and the scars they are leaving.
you will be dancing once again and the pain will end.
you will have no time for grieving.
chiquitita, you and i cry.
but the sun is still in the sky and shining above you.
let me hear you sing once more like you did before.
sing a new song, chiquitita.
try once more like you did before.
sing a new song, chiquitita.

so the walls came tumbling down.
and your loves a blown out candle.
all is gone and it seems too hard to handle.
chiquitita, tell me the truth.
there is no way you can deny it.
i see that you are oh so sad, so quiet.

chiquitita, you and i know.
how the heartaches come and they go and the scars they are leaving.
you will be dancing once again and the pain will end.
you will have no time for grieving.
chiquitita, you and i cry.
but the sun is still in the sky and shining above you.
let me hear you sing once more like you did before.
sing a new song, chiquitita.
try once more like you did before.
sing a new song, chiquitita.
try once more like you did before.
sing a new song, chiquitita.
