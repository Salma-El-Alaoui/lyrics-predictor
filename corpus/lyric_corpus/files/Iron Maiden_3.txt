there goes the siren that warns of the air raid.
then comes the sound of the guns sending flak.
out for the scramble we have got to get airborne.
got to get up for the coming attack.

jump in the cockpit and start up the engines.
remove all the wheelblocks theres no time to waste.
gathering speed as we head down the runway.
gotta get airborne before its too late.

running, scrambling, flying.
rolling, turning, diving, going in again.
running, scrambling, flying.
rolling, turning, diving.
run, live to fly, fly to live, do or die.
will not you run, live to fly, fly to live, aces high.

move in to fire at the mainstream of bombers.
let off a sharp burst and then turn away.
roll over, spin round to come in behind them.
move to their blindsides and firing again.

bandits at 8 oclock move in behind us.
ten me 109s out of the sun.
ascending and turning our spitfires to face them.
heading straight for them i press down my guns.

rolling, turning, diving.
rolling, turning, diving doing it again.
rolling, turning, diving.
rolling, turning, diving.
run, live to fly, fly to live, do or die.
will not you run, live to fly, fly to live, aces high.
