a sweet switchblade knife.
and i can do you favors.
but then you will do whatever i like.

and you are a rocket queen.
i might be a little young.
but honey i aingt naive.

here i am.
and you are a rocket queen, oh yeah.
i might be too much.
but honey you are a bit obscene.

i have seen everything imaginable.
pass before these eyes.
i have had everything thats tangible.
honey youd be surprised.

i am a sexual innuendo.
in this burned out paradise.
if you turn me on to anything.
you better turn me on tonight.

here i am.
and you are a rocket queen.
i might be a little young.

i see you standing, standing on your own.
its such a lonely place for you, for you to be.
if you need a shoulder or if you need a friend.
i will be here standing until the bitter end.

no one needs the sorrow.
no one needs the pain.
i hate to see you.
walking out there, out in the rain.

so do not chastise me.
or think i, i mean you harm.
of those that take you.
leave you strung out much too far, baby, yeah.

woah, no, woah, woah, baby, yeah.

do not ever leave me.
say you will always be there.
all i ever wanted.
was for you to know that i care.
