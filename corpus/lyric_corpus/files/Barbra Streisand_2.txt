when a bee lies sleeping in the palm of your hand.
you are bewitched, and deep in loves long looked after land.
where you will see a sun up sky with a morning moon.
and where the days go laughing by, as love comes a calling on you.

sleep on bee, do not waken, can not believe what just passed.
hes mine for the taking i am happy at last.
maybe i dreams, but he seems sweet golden as a crown.
a sleeping bee done told me, i will walk with my feet off the ground.
when my one true love, i has found.
