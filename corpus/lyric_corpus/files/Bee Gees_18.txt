feel i am going back to massachusetts.
somethings telling me i must go home.
and the lights all went out in massachusetts.
the day i left her standing on her own.

tried to hitch a ride to san francisco.
gotta do the things i wanna do.
and the lights all went out in massachusetts.
they brought me back to see my way with you.

talk about the life in massachusetts.
speak about the people i have seen.
and the lights all went out in massachusetts.
and massachusetts is one place i have seen.

i will remember massachusetts....
