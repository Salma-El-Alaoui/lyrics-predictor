we are all very lucky, i think. the night is lovely. cause last night it was so humid. but tonight its very sort of, in a strange way, peaceful...

silent night, holy night!
all is calm, all is bright.
round yon virgin, mother and child.
holy infant so tender and mild.
sleep in heavenly peace.
sleep in heavenly peace.

silent night, holy night!
all is calm, all is bright.

holy infant so tender and mild.
sleep in heavenly peace.
