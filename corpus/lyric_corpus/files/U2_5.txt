if you twist and turn away.
it you tear yourself in two again.
if i could, yes i would.
if i could, i would let it go.
surrender, dislocate.

if i could throw this lifeless life line to the wind.
leave this heart of clay, see you walk, walk away.
into the night, and through the rain.
into the half light and through the flame.

if i could, through myself, set your spirit free.
id lead your heart away, see you break, break away.
into the light and to the day.

to let it go and so to fade away.
to let it go and so fade away.
i am wide awake.
i am wide awake, wide awake.
i am not sleeping.

if you should ask, then maybe.
theyd tell you what i would say.
true colours fly in blue and black.
blue silken sky and burning flag.
colours crash, collide in blood shot eyes.

if i could, you know i would.
if i could, i would let it go.

this desperation, dislocation.
separation, condemnation.
revelation, in temptation.
isolation, desolation.
let it go and so to find away.
to let it go and so to fade away.
to let it go and so to fade away.

i am wide awake, i am wide awake, wide awake.
i am not sleeping.
oh no, no, no..
