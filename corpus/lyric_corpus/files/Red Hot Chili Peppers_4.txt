one day while bathing in the sea.
my talking dolphin spoke to me.
he spoke to me in symphony.
from freedoms peace beneath the sea.
he looked to me eyes full of love.
said yes we live behind the sun.

behind the sun.
behind the sun.
behind the sun.

the sun goes up.
and the sun gets down.
but like the heart of the sun.
my heart continues to pound.

behind the sun.

now while i shower in the rain.
i watch my dolphin swim away.
the one who listens to the surf.
can feel the pulse beat of the earth.
and like my dolphin swims so free.
the sun does swim into the sea.

behind the sun.
behind the sun.
behind the sun.
behind the sun.

an island flying through the sky.
one day your son might ask you why.
and if your son should be a girl.
she too might ask you of this world.
the sun shines sweet upon your beach.
and yes my dolphin loves to teach.

behind the sun.
behind the sun.
behind the sun.

the sun goes up.
and the sun gets down.
but like the heart of the sun.
my heart continues to pound.

behind the sun.
