wait until the war is over.
and we are both a little older.
the unknown soldier.

breakfast where the news is read.
television children fed.
unborn living. living dead.
bullet strikes the helmets head.

and its all over.
for the unknown soldier.
its all over.
for the unknown soldier.

hup.
hup.
hup ho he hup.
hup.
hup.
hup ho he hup.
compnee.... halt!
present arms!

make a grave for the unknown soldier.
nestled in your hollow shoulder.
the unknown soldier.

breakfast where the news is read.
television children fed.

bullet strikes the helmets head.

and, its all over.
the war is over.
its all over.
the war is over.
well, all over, baby.
all over, baby.
oh, over, yeah.
all over, baby...
