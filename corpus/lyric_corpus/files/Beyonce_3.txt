nobody likes being played.
ay.
beyonc beyonc.
ay.
shakira shakira.
hey!

he said i am worth it.
his one desire.
i know things about him that you would not wanna read about.
he kissed me.
his one and only.
this beautiful liar.
tell me how you tolerate the things you just found out about.

we will never know.
why are we the ones who suffer?
have to let go.
he will not be the one to cry.

chorus.
let us not kill the karma.
let us not start a fight.
its not worth the drama for a beautiful liar.
ca not we laugh about it.
ha ha.
its not worth our time.
oh.
we can live without him just a beautful liar.

i trusted him, but when i followed you.
i saw you together.
i did not know about you then till i saw you with him again.
i walked in.
on your love scene.
slow dancing.
you stole everything how can you say i did you wrong?

we will never know.
when the pain and heartbreaks over.
have to let go.
the innocence is gone.

chorus.

tell me how to forgive you.
when its me whos ashamed.
and i wish i could free you.
of the hurt and the pain.
but the answer is simple .
hes the one to blame.

ay.
beyonc beyonc.
ay.
shakira shakira.
oh.
beyonc beyonc.
oh.
shakira shakira.
hey!

chorus.
