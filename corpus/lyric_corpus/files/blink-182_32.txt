i never thought id die alone.
i laughed the loudest whod have known?
i traced the cord back to the wall.
no wonder it was never plugged in at all.
i took my time, i hurried up.
the choice was mine i did not think enough.
i am too depressed to go on.
you will be sorry when i am gone.

chorus.
i never conquered, rarely came.
16 just held such better days.
days when i still felt alive.
we could not wait to get outside.
the world was wide, too late to try.
the tour was over wed survived.
i could not wait till i got home.
to pass the time in my room alone.

i never thought id die alone.
another six months i will be unknown.
give all my things to all my friends.
you will never step foot in my room again.
you will close it off, board it up.
remember the time that i spilled the cup.
of apple juice in the hall.
please tell mom this is not her fault.

chorus.
i never conquered, rarely came.
16 just held such better days.
days when i still felt alive.
we could not wait to get outside.
the world was wide, too late to try.
the tour was over wed survived.
i could not wait till i got home.
to pass the time in my room alone.

i never conquered, rarely came.
tomorrow holds such better days.
days when i can still feel alive.
when i can not wait to get outside.
the world is wide, the time goes by.
the tour is over, i have survived.
i can not wait till i get home.
to pass the time in my room alone .
