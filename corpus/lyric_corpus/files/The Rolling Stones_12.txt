there have been so many girls that i have known.
i have made so many cry and still i wonder why.
here comes the little girl.
i see her walking down the street.
shes all by herself.
i try and knock her off her feet.
but, she will never break, never break, never break, never break.
this heart of stone.
oh, no, no, this heart of stone.

whats different about her? i do not really know.
no matter how i try i just can not make her cry.
cause she will never break, never break, never break, never break.
this heart of stone.
oh, no, no, no, this heart of stone.

do not keep on looking that some old way.
if you try acting sad, you will only make me glad.
better listen little girl.
you go on walking down the street.
i aingt got no love, i aingt the kind to meet.
cause you will never break, never break, never break, never break.
this heart of stone.
oh, no, no, you will never break this heart of stone darling.
no, no, this heart of stone.
you will never break it darling.
you will not break this heart of stone.
oh no no no.
you better go.
you better go home.
cause you will, you will never break this heart of stone.
