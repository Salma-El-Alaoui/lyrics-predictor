well id like to tell you all about my dream, its a place.
where strip malls abound and diversions mere moments away.

where cultures defined by the.
ones least refined.
and you will be left behind.
if you do not fit in.
its all distorted.
in americana my way.

well fuck you!
well my dream has come true.
my vision has come true.

now give me my cable, fast food, four bys, tats right away.
i want it right now cause my generation do not like to wait.

my futures determined by.
thieves, thugs, and vermin.
its quite an excursion.
but its okay.
everythings backwards.
in americana my way.

well fuck you!
well my dream has come true.
my vision has come true.

i am a product.
of my environment.
so do not blame me, i just work here.. but i wanna fuck you!

my rights are denied by.
those least qualified.
trading profit for pride.
but its okay.
everythings backwards.
in americana my way.

my nightmare has come true.
my nightmare has come true.
yeah, its all coming true.
