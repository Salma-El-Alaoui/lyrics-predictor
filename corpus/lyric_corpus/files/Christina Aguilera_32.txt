here we are, safe at last.
we can breathe a sigh, it seems the storm has passed.
through it all, no one knew.
that all the tears in heaven, would bring me back to you oh.
no one i know, imagined we would make it.
but it only matters that we both believed, oh.

chorus.
you and me, we are a miracle.
meant to be and nothing can change it.
mountains move and oceans part.
when they are standing in our way.
you and me, we are a miracle.
angels stand watching over us.
and heaven shines upon us everyday.

everytime i felt near defeat.
you were there for me oh.
on my side completely.
you give me strength, oh.
you set me free.
its just because of you, oh, i am all that i can be.

when i am with you.
the world is ours to reach for.
together there is nothing we can not do ohhh oh oh.

chorus.
you and me, we are a miracle.
meant to be and nothing can change it.
mountains move and oceans part.
when they are standing in our way.
you and me, we are a miracle.
angels stand watching over us.
and heaven shines upon us everyday.

the chance was so unlikely.
that we would ever be, oh.
two stars among the heavens.
destiny brought you to me.

chorus.
you and me, we are a miracle.
meant to be and nothing can change it.
mountains move and oceans part.
when they are standing in our way.
you and me, we are a miracle.
angels stand watching over us.
and heaven shines upon us everyday, ohh oh oh.

you and me we are a miracle, miracle.

you and me we are a miracle, miracle.

miracle.....
