welcome friends to my thoughts of when.
the fax city 4 were four young men.

with the uplift mofo party plan.
we are the organic anti beat box band.

one comes from the holy land.
another was born an australian.
me i am from michigan.
but hollywood is the land of lands.
its a hollywood jam.

we represent the hollywood kids.
hollywood is where we live.
we represent the hollywood jam.
organic anti beat box band.

life is grand in the land of lands.
the mind does boggle the mind expands.
the anarchy 4 have manned their craft.
get on your knees and shake your ass.
to the jam that is.

we do not ask we demand.
that you and your clan.
listen now to this jam.
to the power of the drummer cause the drummer is bad.
its a hollywood jam.

we represent the hollywood kids.
hollywood is where we live.
we represent the hollywood jam.
organic anti beat box band.

theres a party in my town at 1200.
theres a party thats rocking down to the rock.
i have got nothing against hip hop.
but theres a party in my town.
and no beat box.
jam that is.

the partys got girls the girls got hot.
the partys got boys and the boys got socks.
something popped the doors unlocked.
house got up ran around the block.
sit down house.
take off your blouse.

we represent the hollywood kids.
hollywood is where we live.
any good friend of the lollypop kids.
over the rainbow with the wizz.
we represent the hollywood jam.
organic anti beat box band.
