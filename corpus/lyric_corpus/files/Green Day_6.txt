do you have the time.
to listen to me whine.
about nothing and everything all at once.
i am one of those.
melodramatic fools.
neurotic to the bone, no doubt about it.

sometimes i give myself the creeps.
sometimes my mind plays tricks on me.
it all keeps adding up.
i think i am cracking up.
am i just paranoid?
or am i just stoned?

i went to a shrink.
to analyze my dreams.
she says its lack of sex thats bringing me down.
i went to a whore.
he said my lifes a bore.
so quit my whining cause its bringing her down.

sometimes i give myself the creeps.
sometimes my mind plays tricks on me.
it all keeps adding up.
i think i am cracking up.
and am i just paranoid?
yeah, yeah, yeah.

grasping to control.
so i better hold on.

sometimes i give myself the creeps.
sometimes my mind plays tricks on me.
it all keeps adding up.
i think i am cracking up.
am i just paranoid?
or am i just stoned?
