first you say you want me.
then you do not want me really.
baby do i scare you.
am i talki too freely.

i got no perspective.
on the things that you lack.
baby i do not care.
just lie on your back.

baby i am crazy.
but lady i am lazy.
amaze me.
baby i am faded.
my minds all jaded.
amaze me.

i am so superstitious.
so theres something you should know.
the reason i am doing you is.
cause your friend said no.

i have been suicidal since.
god i do not know when.
so get down on your knees.
say your prayers amen.

baby i am crazy.
lady i am lazy.
amaze me.
baby i am faded.
my minds all jaded.

baby i am lazy.
but lady i am crazy.
amaze me.
baby i am faded.
my minds all jaded.

everybody getting cash for the bung.
everybody wants to know how i am hung.
you can read it in the papers.
i am a giver not a taker.
but it will not be the same.

repeat....
