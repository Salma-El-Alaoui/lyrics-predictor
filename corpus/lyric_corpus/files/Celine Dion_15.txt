so this is who i am.
and this is all i know.
and i must choose to live.
for all that i can give.
the spark that makes the power grow.

and i will stand for my dream if i can.
symbol of my faith in who i am.
but you are my only.
and i must follow on the road that lies ahead.
i will not let my heart control my head.
but you are my only.
we do not say goodbye.
we do not say goodbye.
and i know what i have got to be.

immortality.
i make my journey through eternity.
i keep the memory of you and me inside.

fulfil your destiny.
is there within the child.
my storm will never end.
my fate is on the wind.
the king of hearts, the jokers wild.
but we do not say goodbye.
we do not say goodbye.
i will make them all remember me.

cos i have found a dream that must come true.
every ounce of me must see it through.
but you are my only.
i am sorry i do not have a role for love to play.
hand over my heart i will find my way.
i will make them give to me.

immortality oh baby.
there is a vision and a fire in me ohh.
i keep the memory of you and me, inside.
and we do not say goodbye.
with all my love for you.
and what else we may do.
we do not say, goodbye.
