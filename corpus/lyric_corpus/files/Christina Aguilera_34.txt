i do not know about the travel of time.
and i have never seen most of the world.
i do not know.
diving out of the sky.
or living like the diamonds of pearls.

see i have not danced to a musical tune.
and i have not noticed the flowers in bloom.
i have not smiled.
when alone in my room very much.
then we touched.

i just know.
when you put your hands on me.
i feel sexy.
and my body turns to gold.
i just know.
when you put your hands on me.
i feel ready.
and i lose my self control.

i do not know if a doll can unwind.
or how to make a person go.
i do not know how to be what you like.
and simply open up the depths of my soul.

so i keep my wings.
and my eyes on the down.
ready for nothing.
but holding my ground.
i have not used.
a particular noun very much.
then we touched.

i will not notice.
or pay you no mind.
boy i could not care less.
what you do with your time.
your fingertips on my hips.
just move me like one of a kind.
