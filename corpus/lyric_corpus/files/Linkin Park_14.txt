from the top to the bottom, bottom to top i stop.
at the core i have forgotten in the middle of my thoughts.
taken far from my safety, the pictures there.
the memory will not escape me but why should i care.
from the top to the bottom, bottom to top i stop.
at the core i have forgotten in the middle of my thoughts.
taken far from my safety, the pictures there.
the memory will not escape me but why should i care.

there is a place so dark, you can not see the end.
skies cock back and shock that which can not defend.
the rain then sends dripping, acidic questions.
forcefully, the power of suggestion.
then with the eyes shut.
looking through the rust and rot and dust.
a small spot of light floods the floor and pours over the rusted world of pretend.
and the eyes ease open and its dark again.

from the top to the bottom, bottom to top i stop.
at the core i have forgotten in the middle of my thoughts.
taken far from my safety, the pictures there.
the memory will not escape me but why should i care.

in the memory you will find me.
eyes burning up.
the darkness holding me tightly.
until the sun rises up.

moving all around, screaming of the ups and downs.
pollution manifested in perpetual sound, the wheels go round.
and the sunset creeps behind street lamps.
chain links and concrete.
a little piece of paper with a picture drawn.
floats on down the street until the wind is gone.
the memory now is like the picture was then.
when the paper is crumpled up, it can not be perfect again.

from the top to the bottom, bottom to top i stop.
at the core i have forgotten, in the middle of my thoughts.
taken far from my safety, the pictures there.
the memory will not escape me but why should i care.

now you have got me caught in the act.
you bring the thought back.
i am telling you that.
i see it right through you.
