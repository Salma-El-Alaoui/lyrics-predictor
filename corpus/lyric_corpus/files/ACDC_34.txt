you are workin in bars, ridin in cars.
never gonna give it for free.
your apartment with a view.
on the finest avenue.
lookin at your beat on the street.
you are always pushin, shovin.
satisfied with nothing.
you bitch you must be gettin old.
so stop your love on the road.
all your diggin for gold.
you make me wonder.
yes i wonder.
i wonder.

honey, what do you do for money.
honey, what do you do for money.
how do ya get your kicks?

you are ridin on the take and you are always on the make.
squeezin all the blood out of men.
they are standin in a queue just to spend the night wth you.
its business as usual again.
you are always grabbin, stabbin.
tryin to get it back but girl you must be gettin slow.
so stop your love on the road.
all your diggin for gold.
you make me wonder.
yes i wonder.
yes i wonder.

honey, what do you do for money.
honey, what do you do for money.
what do you do for money honey?
how do you get your kicks?
what do you do for money honey?
how do you get your licks?
