i was talking, i was talking to myself.
somebody else talk, talk, talking.
i could not hear a word, a word he said.

he was my brother.
i said there was no other way out of here.
be my brother.
brother.
got to get out, got to get out.

i was walking, i was walking into walls.
and back again.
i just keep walking.
i walk up to a window to see myself.
and my reflection, when i thought about it.
my direction, going nowhere, going nowhere.

no one, no one is blinder.
than he who will not see.
no one, no one is blinder.
than me.

i was talking, i was talking in my sleep.
i can not stop talk, talk, talking.
i am talking to you, its up to you.
be my brother, there is no other way out of here.
be my brother.
got to get out, got to get out.
got to get out of here..
