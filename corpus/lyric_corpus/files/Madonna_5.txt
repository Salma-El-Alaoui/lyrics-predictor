do not put me off cause i am on fire.
and i can not quench my desire.
do not you know that i am burning up for your love.
you are not convinced that that is enough.
i put myself in this position.
and i deserve the imposition.
but you do not even know i am alive.
and this pounding in my heart just will not die.
i am burning up.

chorus.

i am burning up, burning up for your love.
i am burning up, burning up for your love.
i am burning up, burning up for your love.
for your love.

you are always closing your door.
well that only makes me want you more.
and day and night i cry for your love.
you are not convinced that that is enough.
to justify my wanting you.

i am not blind and i know.
that you want to want me but you can not let go.
come on, let go.
