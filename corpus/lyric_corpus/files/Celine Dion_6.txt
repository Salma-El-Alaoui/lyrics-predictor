close the door.
shut the world away.
all the fights gone from this wounded heart.
across the floor.
dreams and shadows play.
like wind blown refugees.

call the man.
who deals in love beyond repair.
he can heal the world.
of hearts in need of care.
shine a light ahead.
when the next step is unclear.
call the man.
hes needed here.

i close my eyes.
i remember when.
your sweet love filled this empty room.
the tears i cry.
will not bring it back again.
unless the lonely star should fall.

call the man.
who deals in love beyond repair.
he can heal the world.
of hearts in need of care.
shine a light ahead.
when the next step is unclear.
call the man.
hes needed here.

needed in the chaos and confusion.
from the plains to city hall.
needed where the proud who walk the wire are set to fall.

call the man.
who deals in once upon a time.
maybe he.
can mend this broken heart of mine.
shine a light ahead.
now the future is not clear.
call the man.
hes needed here.
call the man.
hes needed here.

hes needed here.
hes needed here.
call the man.

hes needed here.
right here right now.
