i feel my heartbeat.
when you run your fingers through my hair, oh yeah.
i can tell you.
i can feel you by my side when you are not there, oh yeah.
just as my life fades to darkness.
you you make me see the light.
show me that my search is over.
i pay the price, i pay the price.

tell you someday, baby you and i should be one, one.
do it always, brighter than the eye can see, we hide the sun.

the taste of love is sweet, like honey on the vine.
like the wind that feeds the fire, two souls become entwined.
someday baby you and i should be one, one.

verse 2.
so i am standing round this corner.
tall enough to touch the new york sky, oh yeah.
my love is so blind.
i just cannot hear or see the world go by, oh yeah.
someone can love so completely.
one kiss should break the seal.
truth can be stranger than fiction.
this love is real.
this love is real.

tell you someday baby, you and i should be one, one.
do it always, brighter than the eye can see, we hide the sun.

bridge.
ah we are one, we are one.

verse 3.
i will follow.
count on me, i will never let you down, oh yeah.
my devotion.
if love is an ocean i will surely drown, oh yeah.
you will be my only possession.
i will be a slave to you.
we hold the power together.
just me and you.
just me and you.

tell you someday baby, you and i should be one, one.
do it always, brighter than the eye can see, we hide the sun.
tell you someday baby, you and i should be one, one.

you know my life is in your hands.
and every breath you take is planned.
and all this love goes on forever.

tell you someday baby, you and i should be one, one.
do it someday baby, you and i should be one, one.
do it someday baby, you and i should be one, one.... repeat to fade.
