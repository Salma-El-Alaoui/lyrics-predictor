does it go from east to west.
body free and a body less.
come again just to start a fresh.
once again to find a home.
in the moment of the meantime.

dropping in, coming through the mesh.
checking in just to get it blessed.
hard to leave when its picturesque.
find a form thats free to roam.
where you come from.
where you going.

where you come from.
where you going.

do it all then it all again.
make it up and you make a friend.
paddle on just around the bend.
find a place where you can see.
all the mamas and the papas.

take a chance on a recommend.
hard as hell just to comprehend.
disbelief that i do suspend.
easy now to find a breeze.
where you come from.
where you going.

where you come from.
where you going.

we all want to tell her.
tell her that we love her.
venice gets a queen.
best i have ever seen.

we all want to kiss her.
tell her that we miss her.
venice gets a queen.
best i have ever.

i know you said you do not believe.
in godâ€”do you still disagree?
now that its time for you to leave.
g.l.o.r.i.a is love.
my friend.
my friend.
my friend.

your stylish mess of silver hair.
a woman of your kind is rare.
your uniform returns to air.
g.l.o.r.i.a.
is love my friend.

and now its time for you to go.
you taught me most of what i know.
where would i be without you, glo?
g.l.o.r.i.a. is love.
my friend.
my friend.
my friend.

i see you standing by the sea.
the waves you made will always be.
a kiss goodbye before you leave.
g.l.o.r.i.a is love.
my friend.
my friend.
my friend.
