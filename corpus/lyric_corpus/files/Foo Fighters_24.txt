i thought i knew all it took to bother you.
every word i said was true.
that you will see.
how could it be, i am the only one who sees.
your rehearsed insanity, yeah.

i still refuse all the methods you abused.
its alright if you are confused.
let me be.
i have been around all the pawns you gagged and bound.
they will come back and knock you down.
and i will be free.

i have taken all and i have endured.
one day it all will fade, i am sure.

i do not owe you anything.
i do not owe you anything.
i do not owe you anything.
i do not owe you anything.

i had no hand in your ever desperate plan.
it returns and when it lands.
words are due.
i should have known we were better off alone.
i looked in and i was shown.
you were too.

i have taken all and i have endured.
one day it all will fade, i am sure.

i do not owe you anything.
i do not owe you anything.
i do not owe you anything.
i do not owe you anything.
i do not owe you anything.
i do not owe you anything.
i do not owe you anything.
i do not owe you anything.

i will stick around, i will stick around.
learn from all that came from it.
i will stick around, i will stick around.
learn from all that came from it.
i will stick around, i will stick around.
learn from all that came from it.
i will stick around, i will stick around.
learn from all that came from it.
