gonna find a way to cure this loneliness.
yeah i will find a way to cure the pain.
if i said that you are my friend.
and our love would never end.
how long before i had your trust again.
i opened up the doors when it was cold outside.
hoping that youd find your own way in.
but how can i protect you.
or try not to neglect you.
when you will not take the love i have to give.
i bought me an illusion.
an i put it on the wall.
i let it fill my head with dreams.
and i had to have them all.
but oh the taste is never so sweet.
as what youd believe it is .
well i guess it never is.
its these prejudiced illusions.
that pump the blood.
to the heart of the biz.

you know i never thought.
that it could take so long.
you know i never knew how to be strong.
yeah, i let you shape me.
but i feel as though you raped me.
cause you climbed inside my world.
and in my songs.
so now i have closed the door.
to keep the cold outside.
seems somehow i have found the will to live.
but how can i forget you.
or try not to reject you.
when we both know it takes time to forgive.

sweetness is a virtue.
and you lost your virtue long ago.
you know id like to hurt you.
but my conscience always tells me no.
you could sell your body on the street.
to anyone whom you might meet.
whod love to try and get inside.
and bust your innocence open wide.

cause my babys got a locomotive.
my babys gone off the track.
my babys got a locomotive.
got ta peel the bitch off my back.
i know it looks like i am insane.
take a closer look i am not to blame.
no.

gonna have some fun with my frustration.
gonna watch the big screen in my head.
id rather take a detour.
cause this road aingt getting clearer.
your train of thought has cut me off again.
better tame that boy cause hes a wild one.
better tame that boy for hes a man.
sweetheart do not make me laugh.
yous getting too big for your pants.
and is think maybe you should.
cut out while you can.
you can use you illusion .
let it take you where it may.
we live and learn.
and then sometimes its best to walk away.
me i am just here hanging on.
its my only place to stay at least.
for now anyway.
i have worked too hard for my illusions.
just to throw them all away.

i am taking time for quiet consolation.
in passing by this love thats passed away.
i know its never easy .
so why should you believe me.
when i have always got so many things to say.
calling off the dogs a simple choice is made.
cause playful hearts.
can sometimes be enraged.
you know i tried to wake you .
i mean how long could it take you.
to open up your eyes and turn the page.

kindness is a treasure .
and its one towards me you have seldom shown.
so i will say it for good measure.
to all the ones like you i have known.
ya know id like to shave your head.
and all my friends could paint it red.
cause love to mes a two way street.
an all i really want is peace.

but my babys got a locomotive.
my babys gone off the track.
my babys got a locomotive.
got ta peel the bitch off my back.
i know it looks like i am insane.
take a closer look i am not to blame.
no.

affection is a blessing.
can you find it in your sordid heart.
i tried to keep this thing ta gether.
but the tremor tore my pad apart.
yeah i know its hard to face.
when all we have worked fors gone to waste.
but you are such a stupid woman.
and i am such a stupid man.
but love like times got its own plans.

cause my babys got a locomotive.
my babys gone off the track.
my babys got a locomotive.
got ta peel the bitch off my back.
i know it looks like i am insane.
take a closer look i am not to blame.
yeah.
if love is blind i guess.
i will buy myself a cane.

loves so strange.
