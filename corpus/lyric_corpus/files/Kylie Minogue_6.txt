fragile seams.
i opened up too quick and all my dreams.
were walking out id slowly.
lost my fire.
with every single man a river cried.

i had no sensation.
completely numb, left with no satisfaction.
i thought no one could ever get me high again.
i swear, i was not looking.

oh, waited so long.
i thought the real thing was a fake.
i thought it was a tool to break me down.
you proved me wrong again.

if love were liquid it would drown me.
in a placeless place would find me.
in a heart shape come around me and then.
melt me slowly down.
if love were human it would know me.
in a lost space come and show me.
hold me and control me and then.
melt me slowly down.

like chocolate, tastes so good.
my hearts been mended whod have thought it would.
an empty bet and still i won the cash.
a man who i love and who.
loves me back.

oh, waited so long.
for love to heal me so id feel it.
thought it was not breathing then you came.
you proved me wrong again.

if love were liquid it would drown me.
in a placeless place would find me.
in a heart shape come around me and then.
melt me slowly down.
if love were human it would know me.
in a lost space come and show me.
hold me and control me and then.
melt me slowly down.

like chocolate come here.
zoom in, catch the smile.
theres no doubt its from you.
and i am addicted to it now.

just one look boy to melt me down.
just one heart here to save me now.
your candy kisses are sweet i know.
hold me tight baby do not let go.
just one look boy to melt me down.
just one heart here to save me now.
your candy kisses are sweet i know.
hold me tight baby do not let go.
