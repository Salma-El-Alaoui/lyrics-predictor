there you are holding her hand.
i am lost.
dying to understand.
did not i cherish you right.
do not you know you were my life.

chorus.
even though i try i can not let go.
something in your eyes.
captured my soul.
and every night i see you in my dreams.
you are all i know.
i can not let go.

just cast aside.
you do not even know i am alive.
you just walk on by.
do not care to see me cry.
and here i am.
still holding on.
i can not accept.
my world is gone.

chorus.

do you even realize the sorrow i have inside.
everyday of my life.
do you know the way it feels.
when all you have just dies.
i try and try to deny that i need you.
but still you remain on my mind.

no i just can not get you out of my mind.
i never can say goodbye.
cause every night.
i see you in my dreams.

you are all i know.
i can not let you go.
even though i try.
i can not let go of something i need so badly.
you are all i know.
i can not let go.
