atom secrets, secret leaflet.
have the boys found the leak yet?
the molehill sets the wheel in motion.
his downfall picks up locomotion.

the people must have something good to read on a sunday.

the leaders wife takes a government car.
in the dark to meet her minister.
but the leader never leaves his door ajar.
as he swings his whip from the boer war.

he wore a leather mask for his dinner guests.
totally nude and with deep respect.
proposed a toast to the votes he gets.
the feeling of power and the thought of sex!

now the girl let the fat man touch her.
vodka fumes and the feel of a vulture.
the driver waited in the embassy car.
the fat mans trap was set for capture.
so the girl let the thin man touch her.
mixing questions, drunken laughter.
the ministry car was waiting there.
a minister knows his own affair.

the people must have something good to read on a sunday.
