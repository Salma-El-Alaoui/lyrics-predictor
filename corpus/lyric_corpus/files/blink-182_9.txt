its alright   to tell me   what you think   about me.
i will not try   to argue   or hold it   against you.
i know that   you are leaving   you must have   your reasons.
the season   is calling   and your pictures   are falling down.

the steps that   i retrace   the sad look   on your face.
the timing   and structure   did you hear   he fed her?
a day late   a buck short   i am writing   the report.
on losing   and failing   when i move   i am flailing now.

and its happened once again.
i will turn to a friend.
someone that understands.
and sees through the master plan.

but everybodys gone.
and i have been here for too long.
to face this on my own.
well i guess this is growing up.

well i guess this is growing up.

and maybe   i will see you   at a movie   sneak preview.
you will show up   and walk by   on the arm   of that guy.
and i will smile   and you will wave   we will pretend   its okay.
the charade   it will not last   when hes gone   i will not come back.

and it will happen once again.
you will turn to a friend.
someone that understands.
and sees through the master plan.

but everybodys gone.
and you have been there for too long.
to face this on your own.
well i guess this is growing up.

well, i guess this is growing up 5x.
