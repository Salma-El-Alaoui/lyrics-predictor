one summer night.
we ran away for a while.
laughing, we hurried beneath the sky.
to an obscure place to hide.
that no one could find.

and we drifted to another state of mind.
and imagined i was yours and you were mine.
as we lay upon the grass.
there in the dark.
underneath the stars.
young love.
underneath the stars.

weak in the knees.
wrapped in the warm gentle breeze.
so shy, a bundle of butterflies.
flush with heat of desire.
on a natural high.

as we drifted to another place in time.
and the feeling was so heady and sublime.
as i lost my heart to you.
there in the dark.
underneath the stars.
young love.

ooh.
young love.
shoop doo doo doo doo.

beautiful and bittersweetly.
you were fading into me.
and i was gently fading into you baby baby.
but the time went sailing by ooh oh yeah oh yeah.
reluctantly we said goodbye.
and left our secret place so far behind.
and i lay in bed all night.
and i was drifting.
drifting.
drifting.
drifting.

and i was yours.
and you were my own.
my own baby.
as we lay.
as we.
lay underneath the stars.
young love.

ooh ooh whoa oh baby.
shoop doo doo doo.
shoop doo doo doo.
shoop doo doo doo.
ooh ooh whoa oh.
yeah yeah oh.
underneath the stars.
i was drifting.
drifting.
drifting.
underneath the stars.
young love.
young love.
and i.
underneath the stars.
baby,baby.
