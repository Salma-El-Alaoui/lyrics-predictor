 nanker phelge.

well, you have got your diamonds and you have got your pretty clothes.
and the chauffeur drives your car.
you let everybody know.
but do not play with me, cause you are playing with fire.

your mother shes an heiress, owns a block in saint johns wood.
and your fatherd be there with her.
if he only could.
but do not play with me, cause you are playing with fire.

your old man took her diamonds and tiaras by the score.
now she gets her kicks in stepney.
not in knightsbridge anymore.
so do not play with me, cause you are playing with fire.

now you have got some diamonds and you will have some others.
but youd better watch your step, girl.
or start living with your mother.
so do not play with me, cause you are playing with fire.
so do not play with me, cause you are playing with fire.
