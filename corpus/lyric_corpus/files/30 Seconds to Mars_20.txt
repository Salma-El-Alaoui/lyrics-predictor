i open up my head inside.
and find another persons mind.
i am gonna take this chance i have got.
i run denying as we speak.
hiding my face among the weak.
some say their day is on the way.

into the wild.
i am with a mission.
over the hill.
come here with me.

into the wild.
into the wild.

high above the serpentine.
i cross below the well worn lines.
entangled in a missing memory.
i have had an oversight.
i formed this sword that will give rise.
to something some new world is here to seize.

into the wild.
into the wild.

i love you this is a dream.
i am starting its easy to see.
to find someone else.
someone who believes.
and i know it.
i see what you mean.

into the wild.
i am with a mission.
over the hill.
come here with me.

into the wild.
i am with a mission.
over the hill.
come here with me.
