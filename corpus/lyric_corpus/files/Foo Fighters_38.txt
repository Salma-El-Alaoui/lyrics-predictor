keep you in the dark.
you know they all pretend.
keep you in the dark.
and so it all began.

send in your skeletons.
sing as their bones go marching in...again.
the need you bury deep.
the secrets that you keep are at the ready.
are you ready?
i am finished making sense.
done pleading ignorance.
that whole...defense.
spinning infinity, boy.
the wheel is spinning me.
its never ending, never ending.
same old story.

what if i say i am not like the others?
what if i say i am not just another one of your plays?
you are the pretender.
what if i say i will never surrender?

what if i say i am not like the others?
what if i say i am not just another one of your plays?

what if i say that i will never surrender?

in time or so i am told.
i am just another soul for sale...oh, well.
the page is out of print.
we are not permanent.
we are temporary, temporary.
same old story.

what if i say i am not like the others?
what if i say i am not just another one of your plays?
you are the pretender.

i am the voice inside your head.
you refuse to hear.
i am the face that you have to face.
mirrored in your stare.
i am whats left, i am whats right.
i am the enemy.
i am the hand that will take you down.
and bring you to your knees.
