something inside the cards i know is right.
do not wanna live somebody elses life.
this is what i want to be.
and this is what i give to you.
because i get it free.
she smiles while i do my time.

i could die for you.
oh this life i choose.

i am here to be your only go between.
to tell you of the sights these eyes have seen.
what i really want to do, is turn it into motion.
beauty that i can not abuse.
you know that i use my senses to.
you can see that its only everywhere.
id take it all and then id find a way to share.
come along and go along with me.
wander with me yo.
its all for free.

i could die for you.
what you wanna do.
oh this life i choose.
i could die for you.
what you wanna do.
oh this life i choose.

come again and tell me where you wanna go.
what it means for me to be with you alone.
close the door and no one has to know.
how we are.

come along and go along with me.
wander with me yo.
its all for free.

i could die for you.
what you wanna do.
oh this life i choose.
