he touched me, he put his hand near mine.
and then he touched me.
i felt a sudden tingle when he touched me.
a sparkle, a glow.

he knew it...it was not accidental, no, he knew it.
he smiled and seem to tell me so all through it.
he knew it, i know...
hes real, and the world is alive and shining.


i feel such a wonderful drive twards valentining.
he touched me i simply have to face the fact.
he touched me...
control myself and try to act.
as if i remember my name.
but he touched me...he touched me...
and suddenly nothing is the same!
cause he touched me...he touched me...
and suddenly...nothing, nothing, nothing is the same.
