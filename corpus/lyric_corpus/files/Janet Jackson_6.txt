verse 1.
theres something i want to tell you.
theres something i think that you should know.
its not that i should not really love you.
let us take it slow.
when we get to know each other.
and we are both feeling much stronger.
then let us try to talk it over.
let us wait awhile longer.

chorus.
let us wait awhile before its too late.
let us wait awhile, our love will be great.
let us wait awhile before we go too far.

verse 2.
remember that special night?
when all of the stars were shining bright.
we made our first endeavor to stay together.
we made our very first promise.
to love, to share and be real honest.


but on that very first night.
it was not quite right.

chorus.
let us wait awhile before its too late.
let us wait awhile, our love will be great.
let us wait awhile before we go too far.

i did not really know not to let all my feelings show.
to save some for later so our love will be greater.
you said you would always love me.
remember i said the same thing too.
you do not have to be frightened with my love.
because i will never give up on you.
let us wait awhile, before its too late.
you know, you can not rush love.
let us just take our time.
loves so good   sure i will love will be there.
slow it down.
i promise, i will be worth the wait..
