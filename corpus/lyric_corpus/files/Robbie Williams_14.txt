are you cut up or do you easily forget ?
are you still around, why have not you managed to die yet ?
you could prop up the bar in hell.
how do you sleep, you have never loved.
why was i never good enough ?
you thought youd leave me falling forever.
karma killer.
needless to say, i guess you know i hate you.
you are so full of sin even the devil rates you.
i hope you choke on your bacardi and coke.
how do you breathe, why do not you cry ?
how come you never ask me why ?
you are not a man, stand and deliver.

how do you sleep, you have never loved.
why was i never good enough ?
you thought youd leave me falling forever.
