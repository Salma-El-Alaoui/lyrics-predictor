oh my heart will not believe that you have left me.
i keep telling my self that its true.
i can get over anything you want my love.
but i can not get myself over you.

do not forget to remember me.
and the love that used to be.
i still remember you.
i love you.
in my heart lies a memory to tell the stars above.
do not forget to remember me my love.

on my wall lies a photograph of you girl.
though i try to forget you somehow.
you are the mirror of my soul so take me out of my hole.
let me try to go on living right now.

do not forget to remember me.
and the love that used to be.
i still remember you.
i love you.
in my heart lies a memory to tell the stars above.
do not forget to remember me my love.
