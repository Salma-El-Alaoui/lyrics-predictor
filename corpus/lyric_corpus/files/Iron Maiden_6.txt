covered in sinners and dripping with guilt.
making you money from slime and from filth.
parading your bellies in ivory towers.
investing our lives in your schemes and your powers.

you got to watch them   be quick or be dead.
snake eyes in heaven   the thief in your head.
you have got to watch them   be quick or be dead.
snake eyes in heaven   the thief in your head.

be quick or be dead   be quick or be dead.
see... whats ruling all our lives.
see... whos pulling the strings...
i bet you will not fall on your face...
your belly will hold you in place.

the serpent is crawling inside of your ear.
he says you must vote for what you want to hear.
do not matter whats wrong as long as you are alright.
so pull yourself stupid and rob yourself blind..
