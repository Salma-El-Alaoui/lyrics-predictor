i saw a spider, i did not scream.
cause i can belch the alphabet, just double dog dare me.
and i chose guitar over ballet.
and i take these suckers down cuz they just get in my way.

the way you look at me is kinda like a little sister.
you high five your goodbyes and it leaves me nothing but blisters.

so i do not want to be one of the boys, one of your guys.
just give me a chance to prove to you tonight.
i just wanna be one of the girls, pretty in pearls.
not one of the boys.

so over summer something changed.
i started reading 17 and shaving my legs.
and i study lolita religously.
and i walked right in school and caught you staring at me.

cause i know what you know but now you are gonna have to take a number.
its okay, maybe one day but not until you give me my diamond ring.

cause i do not want to be one of the boys, one of your guys.
just give me a chance to prove to you tonight.
that i just wanna be a homecoming queen, be a poster dream.
not one of the boys.

i wanna be a flower not a dirty weed.
and i wanna smell like roses not a baseball team.
and i swear maybe one day you are gonnna wanna.
make out make out make out with me.

so i do not want to be one of the boys, one of your guys.
just give me a chance to prove to you tonight.
i just wanna be one of the girls, pretty in pearls.
not one of the boys.
