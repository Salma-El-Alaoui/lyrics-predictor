now you say you are lonely.
you cried the lone night through.
well, you can cry me a river.
cry me a river.
i cried a river over you.

now you say you are sorry.
for being so untrue.
well, you can cry me a river.
cry me a river.
i cried a river over you.

you drove me.
nearly drove me out of my head.
while you never shed a tear.
remember?
i remember all that you said.
told me love was too plebeian.
told me you were through with me.

now you say you love me.


well, just to prove you do.
cry me a river.
cry me a river.
i cried a river over you.

you drove me.
nearly drove me out of my head.
while you never shed a tear.
remember?
i remember all that you said.
told me love was too plebeian.
told me you were through with me...

and now you say you love me.
well, just to prove that you do...
come on! come on!
cry me a river...
cry me a river...
i cried a river over you.
i cried a river over you....
