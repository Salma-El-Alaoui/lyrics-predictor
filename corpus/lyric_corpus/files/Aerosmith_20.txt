i could stay awake just to hear you breathing.
watch you smile while you are sleeping.
while you are far away and dreaming.
i could spend my life in this sweet surrender.
i could stay lost in this moment forever.
when every moment spent with you is a moment i treasure.

chorus.
do not wanna close my eyes.
i do not wanna fall asleep.
cause id miss you baby.
and i do not wanna miss a thing.
cause even when i dream of you.
the sweetest dream would never do.
id still miss you babe.
and i do not wanna miss a thing.

lying close to you.
feeling your heart beating.
and i am wondering what you are dreaming.
wondering if its me you are seeing.
and then i kiss your eyes.
and thank god we are together.
i just wanna stay with you in this moment forever.
forever and ever.

chorus.

and i do not wanna miss one smile.
i do not wanna miss one kiss.
i just wanna be with you.
right here with you, just like this.
i just wanna hold you close.
and feel your heart so close to mine.
and just stay here in this moment.
for all the rest of time yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah!!

chorus to end.
