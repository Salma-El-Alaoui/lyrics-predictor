i have been walking in the same way as i did.
missing all the cracks in the pavement.
and tutting my heel and strutting my feet.
is there anything i can do for you dear? is there anyone i could call?
no and thank you, please madame, i aingt lost, just wandering.

round my hometown.
memories are fresh.
round my hometown.
ooh the people i have met.
are the wonders of my world.
are the wonders of my world.
are the wonders of this world.
are the wonders now.

i like it in the city when the air is so thick and opaque.
i love to see everybody in short skirts, shorts and shades.
i like it in the city when two worlds collide.
you get the people and the government.
everybody taking different sides.

shows that we aingt gonna stand shit.
shows that we are united.
shows that we aingt gonna take it.
shows that we aingt gonna stand shit.
shows that we are united.

round my hometown.
memories are fresh.
round my hometown.
ooh the people i have met.
