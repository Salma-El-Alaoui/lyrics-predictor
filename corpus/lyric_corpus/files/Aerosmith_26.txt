i am dreaming tonight, i am living back home.

right!

take me back to a south tallahassee.
down cross the bridge to my sweet sassafras y.
ca not stand up on my feet in the city.
gotta get back to the real nitty gritty.

yes, sir. no, sir.
do not come close to my.
home, sweet home.
ca not catch no dose.
of my hot tail poontang sweetheart.
sweathog ready to make a silk purse.
from a j. paul getty and his ear.
with her face in her beer.

home, sweet home.

get out in the field.
put the mule in the stable.
ma, shes a cooking.
put the eats on the table.
hates in the city.
and my loves in the meadow.
hands on the plow.
and my feet in the ghetto.

stand up, sit down.
do not do nothing.
it aingt no good when the boss man.
stuffing down their throats.
for paper notes.
and their babies cry.
while cities lie at their feet.
when you are rocking the street.

home, sweet home.

mama, take me home, sweet home.
i was the last child.
i am just a punk in the street..
