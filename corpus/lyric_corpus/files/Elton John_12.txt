music by elton john.
lyrics by tim rice.
from the lion king soundtrack.

way behind the water hole.
a little down the line.
the jungle and the plains and peaks.
are scheduled to be mine.

i am gonna be the ruler.
of most everything around.
from the grandest of the mountains.
to the humble common ground.
my reign will be a super awesome thing.
oh, i just can not wait to be king.

i am gonna be a noble king.
unscrupulously fair.
i only need a little time.
perhaps a little hair.

i am gonna be the mane event.
like no king was before.
i am brushing up on looking down.
i am working on my roar.
the fauna and the flora gonna swing.
oh, i just can not wait to be king.

no one saying do this.
no one saying be there.
no one saying stop that.
no one saying see here.
free to run around all day.
i will be free to do it my way.

the time has come as someone said.
to talk of many things.
this may be true.
but i would rather stick to talking kings.

its easy to be royal if you are already leonine.
it is not just my right even my left will be divine.
the monarchy is waiting to go zing.
oh i just can not wait to be king.
