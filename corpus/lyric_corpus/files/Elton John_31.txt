i was justified when i was five.
raising cain, i spit in your eye.
times are changing, now the poor get fat.
but the fevers gonna catch you when the bitch gets back.

eat meat on friday thats alright.
even like steak on a saturday night.
i can bitch the best at your social dos.
i get high in the evening sniffing pots of glue.

i am a bitch, i am a bitch.
oh the bitch is back.
stone cold sober as a matter of fact.
i can bitch, i can bitch.
cause i am better than you.
its the way that i move.
the things that i do.

i entertain by picking brains.
sell my soul by dropping names.
i do not like those, my god, whats that.
oh its full of nasty habits when the bitch gets back.
