i know that things are getting tougher.
when you can not get the top off.
the bottom of the barrel.
wide open road of my future now...
is fucking, fucking narrow.

all i know is that i do not know.
all i know is that i do not know nothing.

we get told to decide.
just like as if.
i am not gonna to change my mind.

whatcha gonna do with yourself.
boy better make up your mind.
whatcha gonna do with yourself.
you are running out of time.

all i know is that i do not know.
all i know is that i do not know nothing.
and thats fine.
