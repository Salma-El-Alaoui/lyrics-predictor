i am reckless and feeling no pain.
you know i have got no need to control.
living with the danger.
i am always on the edge now.
with million dollar visions that i hold.
living like this never ever.
tore my life apart.
i know how to maintain.
and you know i know my part.

on a holiday, a permanent vacation.
i am living on a cigarette with wine.
i am never alone cause i have got myself.
yes, i imitate myself all of the time.

living like this never ever.
tore my life apart.
i know how to maintain.
cause its coming from my heart.

i lead a reckless life.
and i do not need your advice.
i lead a reckless life.
and you know its my only vice.

reckless life.
i lead a reckless life.
i lead a reckless life.
and you know its my only...

reckless life.
i lead a reckless life.
i lead a reckless life.
and you know its my only...
hey, hey   yeah!
