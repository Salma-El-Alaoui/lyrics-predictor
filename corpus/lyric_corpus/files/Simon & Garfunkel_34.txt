i am just a poor boy.
though my storys seldom told.
i have squandered my resistance.
for a pocketful of mumbles.
such are promises.
all lies and jest.
still, a man hears what he wants to hear.
and disregards the rest.

when i left my home.
and my family.
i was no more than a boy.
in the company of strangers.
in the quiet of the railway station.
running scared.
laying low.
seeking out the poorer quarters.
where the ragged people go.
looking for the places.
only they would know.

lie la lie...lie le lie le lie le lai.... lai le lai...........lai le lai lelelelelai lelelelelaiii.

asking only workmans wages.
i come looking for a job.
but i get no offers.
just a come on from the whores.
on seventh avenue.
i do declare.
there were times when i was so.
lonesome.
i took some comfort there.

lie la lie...

then i am laying out my winter clothes.
and wishing i was gone.
going home.
where the new york city winters.
are not bleeding me.
leading me.
going home.

in the clearing stands a boxer.
and a fighter by his trade.
and he carries the reminders.
of evry glove that laid him down.
and cut him till he cried out.
in his anger and his shame.
i am leaving, i am leaving.
but the fighter still remains.

lie la lie....
