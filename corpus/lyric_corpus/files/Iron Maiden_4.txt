lying awake at night i wipe the sweat.
from my brow.
but its not the fear cos.
id rather go now.

trying to visualize the horrors that.
will lay ahead.
the desert sand mound a burial ground.

when it comes to the time.
are we partners in crime?
when it comes to the time.
we will be ready to die.

god let us go now and finish whats.
to be done.
thy kingdom come.
thy shall be done  on earth.

trying to justify to ourselves the.
reasons to go.
should we live and let live.
forget or forgive.

but how can we let them go on this way?
the reign of terror, corruption must end.
and we know, deep down theres.
no other way.
no trust, no reasoning, no more to say.

afraid to shoot strangers.
afraid to shoot strangers.
