out of winter came a warhorse of steel.
i have never killed a woman before but i know how it feels.
i know youd have gone insane if you saw what i saw.
so now i have got to look for sanctuary from the law.

i met up with a slinger last night to keep me alive.
he spends all his money on gambling and guns to survive.
i know youd have gone insane if youd saw what i saw.
so now i have got to look for sanctuary from the law.

chorus so give me sanctuary from the law.
and i will be alright.
just give me sanctuary from the law.
and love me tonight..........tonight.

i know youd have gone insane if you saw what i saw.
so now i have got to look for sanctuary from the law.

chorus so give me sanctuary from the law.
and i will be alright.
just give me sanctuary from the law.
and love me tonight............tonight.

i can laugh at the wind.
i can howl at the rain.
down in the canyon or out on the plains.

i know youd have gone insane if you saw what i saw.
so now i have to look for sanctuary from the law.

chorus so give me sanctuary from the law.
and i will be alright.
just give me sanctuary from the law.
and love me tonight...........tonight.
