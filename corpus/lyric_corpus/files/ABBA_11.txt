i was a fighter always looking for trouble.
and my life was so empty.
there was nothing left to live for.
but then it happened one night.
as i got into a fight.
i could hear someone saying.
as though he was praying ah  .

treat him well, he is your brother.
you might need his help one day.
we depend on one another.
love him thats the only way.
on the road that we are going.
we all need words of comfort and compassion.
treat him well, he is your brother.
love him thats the only way.

i was a woman never thinking of others.
and my life was so lonely.
did not care for anybody.
but then i happened to meet.
a begging man in the street.
as i turned down his praying.
i heard someone saying ah  .

treat him well, he is your brother.
you might need his help one day.
we depend on one another.
love him thats the only way.
on the road that we are going.
we all need words of comfort and compassion.
treat him well, he is your brother.
love him thats the only way.
