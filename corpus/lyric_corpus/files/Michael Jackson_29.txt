your love is magical, thats how i feel.
but i have not the words here to explain.
gone is the grace for expressions of passion.
but there are worlds and worlds of ways to explain.
to tell you how i feel.

but i am speechless, speechless.
thats how you make me feel.
though i am with you i am far away and nothing is for real.
when i am with you i am lost for words, i do not know what to say.
my heads spinning like a carousel, so silently i pray.

helpless and hopeless, thats how i feel inside.
nothings real, but all is possible if god is on my side.
when i am with you i am in the light where i cannot be found.
its as though i am standing in the place called hallowed ground.

speechless, speechless, thats how you make me feel.
though i am with you i am far away and nothing is for real.

i will go anywhere and do anything just to touch your face.
theres no mountain high i cannot climb i am humbled in your grace.

speechless, speechless, thats how you make me feel.
though i am with you i am lost for words and nothing is for real.

speechless, speechless, thats how you make me feel.
though i am with you i am far away, and nothing is for real.

speechless, speechless, thats how you make me feel.
though i am with you i am lost for words and nothing is for real.
speechless.

your love is magical, thats how i feel.
but in your presence i am lost for words words like, ampquoti love you.ampquot.
