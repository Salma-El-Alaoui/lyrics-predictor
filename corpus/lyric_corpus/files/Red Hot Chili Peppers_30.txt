to finger paint is not a sin.
i put my middle finger in.
your monthly blood is what i win.
i am in your house now let me spin.

python power straight from monty.
celluloid love got a john frusciante.
spread your head and spread the blanket.
shes too free i am the patient.

black and white red and blue.
things that look good on you.
and if i scream do not let me go.
a purple stain   i know.

knock on wood we all stay good.
cause we all live in hollywood.
with dracula and darla hood.
unspoken words were understood.

up to my ass in alligators.
let us get it on with alligator haters.
did what you did   did what you said.
whats the point yo whats the spread.

black and white red and blue.
things that look good on you.
and if i scream do not let me go.
a purple stain   i know.
and if i call for you to stay.
come hit the funk on your way.
its the way out there but i do not care.
cause this is where i go.

knock on wood we all stay good.
cause we all live in hollywood.
with dracula and darla hood.
unspoken words were understood.

its way out there.
but i do not care.
cause this is what.

knock on wood we all stay good.
cause we all live in hollywood.

to finger paint is not a sin.
i put my middle finger in.
your monthly blood is what i win.
i am in your house now let me spin.

feather light but you can not move this.

purple is the stain upon my pillow.
let us sleep weeping willow.

black and white red and blue.
things that look good on you.
and if i scream do not let me go.
a purple stain   i know.
and if i call for you to stay.
come hit the funk on your way.
its way out there but i do not care.
