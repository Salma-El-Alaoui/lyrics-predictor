well remember those walls i built.
well baby they are tumbling down.
and they did not even put up a fight.
they did not even make a sound.
i found a way to let you in.
but i never really had a doubt.
standing in the light of your halo.
i got my angel now.

its like i have been awakened.
every rule i had you breaking.
its the risk that i am taking.
i aingt never gonna shut you out.

everywhere i am looking now.
i am surrounded by your embrace.
baby i can see your halo.
you know you are my saving grace.
you are everything i need and more.
its written all over your face.
baby i can feel your halo.
pray it will not fade away.

i can feel your halo halo halo.
i can see your halo halo halo.
i can feel your halo halo halo.
i can see your halo halo halo.
woah...

hit me like a ray of sun.
burning through my darkest night.
you are the only one that i want.
think i am addicted to your light.
i swore id never fall again.
but this do not even feel like falling.
gravity can not forget.
to pull me to the ground again.

feels like i have been awakened.
every rule i had you breaking.
the risk that i am taking.
i am never gonna shut you out.

everywhere i am looking now.
i am surrounded by your embrace.
baby i can see your halo.

you are everything i need and more.
its written all over your face.
