breathe, breathe in the air.
do not be afraid to care.
leave but do not leave me.
look around and choose your own ground.

long you live and high you fly.
and smiles you will give and tears you will cry.
and all you touch and all you see.
is all your life will ever be.

run, rabbit run.
dig that hole, forget the sun.
and when at last the work is done.
do not sit down its time to dig another one.

for long you live and high you fly.
but only if you ride the tide.
and balanced on the biggest wave.
you race towards an early grave..
