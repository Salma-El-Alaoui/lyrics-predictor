i, i am a one way motorway.
i am a road that drives away and follows you back home.
i, i am a streetlight shining.
i am a white light blinding bright, burning off and on.

its times like these you learn to live again.
its times like these you give and give again.
its times like these you learn to love again.
its times like these, time and time again.

i, i am a new day rising.
i am a brand new sky to hang the stars upon tonight.
but i, i am a little divided.
do i stay or run away and leave it all behind.

its times like these you learn to live again.
its times like these you give and give again.
its times like these you learn to love again.
its times like these, time and time again.

its times like these you learn to live again.
its times like these you give and give again.
its times like these you learn to love again.
its times like these, time and time again.

its times like these you learn to live again.
its times like these you give and give again.
its times like these you learn to love again.
its times like these, time and time again.

its times like these you learn to live again.
its times like these you give and give again.
its times like these you learn to love again.
its times like these, time and time again.
