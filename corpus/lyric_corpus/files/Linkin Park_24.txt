are you lost in your lies?
do you tell yourself i do not realize?
your crusades a disguise.
replaced freedom with fear, you trade money for lives.
i am aware of what you have done.

no, no more sorrow!
i have paid for your mistakes!
your time is borrowed!
your time has come to be replaced!

i see pain, i see need.
i see liars and thieves abuse power with greed.
i had hope, i believed.
but i am beginning to think that i have been deceived.
you will pay for what you have done!

no, no more sorrow!
i have paid for your mistakes!
your time is borrowed!
your time has come to be replaced!

thieves and hypocrites!
thieves and hypocrites!
thieves and hypocrites!

no, no more sorrow!
i have paid for your mistakes!
your time is borrowed!
your time has come to be replaced!

no more sorrow!
i have paid for your mistakes!
your time is borrowed!
your time has come to be replaced!
your time has come to be replaced!
your time has come to be erased!
