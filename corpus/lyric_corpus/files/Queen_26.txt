i have paid my dues.
time after time.
i have done my sentence.
but committed no crime.

and bad mistakes.
i have made a few.
i have had my share of sand kicked in my face.
but i have come through.
and we mean to go on and on and on.

we are the champions   my friends.
and we will keep on fighting   till the end.
we are the champions.
we are the champions.
no time for losers.
cause we are the champions   of the world.

i have taken my bows.
and my curtain calls.
you brought me fame and fortune and everything that goes with it.
i thank you all.

but its been no bed of roses.
no pleasure cruise.
i consider it a challenge before the whole human race.
and i aingt gonna lose.
and i need to go on and on and on.

we are the champions   my friends.
and we will keep on fighting   till the end.
we are the champions.
we are the champions.
no time for losers.
cause we are the champions   of the world.

we are the champions   my friends.
and we will keep on fighting   till the end.
we are the champions.
we are the champions.
no time for losers.
cause we are the champions.
