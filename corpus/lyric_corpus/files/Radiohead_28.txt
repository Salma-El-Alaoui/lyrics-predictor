do not get any big ideas.
they are not gonna happen.
you paint yourself white.
and fill up with noise.
but there will be something missing.

now that you have found it, its gone.
now that you feel it, you do not.
you have gone off the rails.

so do not get any big ideas.
they are not gonna happen.
you will go to hell.
for what your dirty mind is thinking.
