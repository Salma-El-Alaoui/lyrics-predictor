those days of love are gone.
our time is through.
still i burn on and on.
all of my life only for you.

from now until forever, and ever.
my darling, forever.
you will always be the only one.
you will always be the only one.

as long as i shall live.
i will hold you, dear.
and i will reminisce of our love.
all through the years.

from now until forever, and ever.
my darling, forever.
you will always be the only one.
you will always be the only one.

if you should ever need me.
unfailingly i will return to your arms.
and unburden your heart.
and if you should remember.
that we belong together.
never be ashamed, call my name.
tell me i am the one you treasure.

forever and ever.
my darling, forever.
you will always be the only one.
you will always be the only one.

forever you will always be the only one.
forever you will always be the only one.
forever you will always be the only one.
forever you will always be the only one...
repeat  fade.
