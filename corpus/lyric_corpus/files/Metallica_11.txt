say your prayers little one.
do not forget, my son.
to include everyone.
i tuck you in, warm within.
keep you free from sin.
till the sandman he comes.

sleep with one eye open.
gripping your pillow tight.

exit light.
enter night.
take my hand.
we are off to never never land.

somethings wrong, shut the light.
heavy thoughts tonight.
and they are not of snow white.
dreams of war, dreams of liars.
dreams of dragons fire.
and of things that will bite.

sleep with one eye open.
gripping your pillow tight.

exit light.
enter night.
take my hand.
we are off to never never land.

yeah heah!

now i lay me down to sleep.
now i lay me down to sleep.
pray the lord my soul to keep.
pray the lord my soul to keep.
if i die before i wake.
if i die before i wake.
pray the lord my soul to take.
pray the lord my soul to take.

hush little baby, do not say a word.
and never mind that noise you heard.
its just the beasts under your bed.
in your closet, in your head.

exit light.
enter night.
grain of sand.
exit light.
enter night.
take my hand.
we are off to never never land.

yeah, oooh!

yeah, yeah!

yo oh!

we are off to never never land.
take my hand.

we are off to never never land.
take my hand.

we are off to never never land.

we are off to never never land.

we are off to never never land.
