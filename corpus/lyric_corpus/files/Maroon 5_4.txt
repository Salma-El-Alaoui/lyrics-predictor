you left me hanging from a thread we once swung from together.
i have lick my wounds but i can not ever see them getting better.
somethings gotta change.
things cannot stay the same.

her hair was pressed against her face, her eyes were red with anger.
enraged by things unsaid and empty beds and bad behaviour.
somethings gotta change.
it must be rearranged.

i am sorry, i did not mean to hurt my little girl.
its beyond me, i cannot carry the weight of the heavy world.
so goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight.
goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight.
goodnight, hope that things work out all right.

the room was silent as we all tried so hard to remember.
the way it feels to be alive.
the day that he first met her.
somethings gotta change.
things cannot stay the same.

you make me think of someone wonderful.
but i can place her.
i wake up every morning wishing one more time to face her.
somethings gotta change.
it must be rearranged.

i am sorry, i did not mean to hurt my little girl.
its beyond me, i cannot carry the weight of a heavy world.
so goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight.
goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight.
goodnight, hope that things work out all right.

so much to love.
so much to learn.
but i will be there to teach you.
i know i can be close.
but i try my best to reach you.

i am so sorry, i did not mean to hurt my little girl.
its beyond me, i cannot carry the weight of a heavy world.
so goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight.
goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight.
goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight.
goodnight, hope that things work out all right..
