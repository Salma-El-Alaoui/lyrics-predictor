i want you to remember, first kiss you ever had, when our lips met together.
i knew that was that, i am still standing, keeping you dancing yeah, you know.
you want it, i am still going, making the party blow, the way you like it, do.
you wanna hear me sing pop, cause i do not think i wanna stop, and i love it.
when my beats drop, yeah it makes me feel hot, guess whose back on top, i will.
happily surrender, to your desire, a touch so warm and tender, is setting me.
on fire, funkin to this sound, we are gonna get down, pop, stop, drop, hot.
