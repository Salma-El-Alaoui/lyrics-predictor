they came flying from far away.
now i am under their spell.
i love hearing the stories that they tell.
 
they have seen places beyond my land.
and they have found new horizons.
they speak strangely but i understand.
 
and i dream, i am an eagle.
and i dream, i can spread my wings.
flying high, high, i am a bird in the sky.
i am an eagle that rides on the breeze.
 
high, high, what a feeling to fly.
over mountains and forests and seas.
and to go anywhere that i please.
 
as all good friends, we talk all night.
and we fly wing to wing.
i have questions and they know everything.
 
theres no limit to what i feel.
we climb higher and higher.
am i dreaming or is it all real?
 
is it true, i am an eagle?
is it true, i can spread my wings?
flying high, high, i am a bird in the sky.
i am an eagle.
i am an eagle that rides on the breeze.
 
high, high, what a feeling to fly.
what a feeling.
over mountains and forests and seas.
and to go anywhere that i please .
