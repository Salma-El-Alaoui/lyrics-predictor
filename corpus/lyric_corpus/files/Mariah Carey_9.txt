 haverse 1.
you just let it die.
with no goodbyes.
details do not matter.
we both paid the price.
tears in my eyes.
you know sometimes.
itd be like that baby.
now every time i see you.
i pretend i am fine.
when i want to reach out to you.
but i turn around.
and i let it ride.
baby i must confess.
we were bigger than anything.
remember us at our best.
and do not forget about...

chorus 1.
late nights, playing in the dark.
and waking up inside my arms.
boy you will always be in my heart and.
i can see it in your eyes.
you still want it.
so do not forget about us.
i am just speaking from experience.
nothing can compare to your first true love.
so i hope this will remind you.
when its for real, its forever.
so do not forget about us.

 haverse 2.
oh they say.
that you are in a new relationship.
but we both know.
nothing comes close to.
what we had, it perseveres.
that we both can not forget it.
how good we used to get it.
theres only one me and you.
and how we used to shine.
no matter what you go through.
we are one, thats a fact.
that you can not deny.
so baby we just can not let.
the fire pass us by.
forever wed both regret.
so do not forget about.
