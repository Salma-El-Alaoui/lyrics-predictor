i look into his eyes.
they are closed but i see something.
a teacher told me why.
i laugh when old men cry.

my body grows and grows.
it frightens me, you know.
the old man tried to walk me home.
i thought he should have known.

twilight, lost my way.
twilight, can not find my way.

in the shadow, boy meets man.
in the shadow, boy meets man.
in the shadow, boy meets man.
in the shadow, boy meets man.

i am running in the rain.
i am caught in a late night play.
its all, its everything.
i am soaking through the skin.

twilight, darkened day.
twilight, lost my way.
twilight, night and day.
twilight, can not find my way.
ca not find your way.
ca not find my way.
ca not find your way.

twilight, darkened day.
twilight, lost my way.
twilight, night and day.
twilight, can not find my way.

in the shadow, boy meets man.
in the shadow, boy meets man.
in the shadow, boy meets man.
in the shadow, boy meets man..
