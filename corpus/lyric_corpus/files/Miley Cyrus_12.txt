i have to wonder if this waves too big to ride.
commit or not commit in such a crazy tide.
its sooner than i thought but you called me out.
i lost control and theres no doubt, i am gonna start all over!

out of the fire and into the fire again.
you make me want to forget and start all over.
here i come straight out of my mind or worse.
another chance to get burned and start all over.
i am gonna start all over.

fantastic and romantic, all a big surprise.
you have got the warning hesitation pushed aside.
its sooner than i want but you caught my heart.
i guess i am ready now to start, i am gonna start all over!

out of the fire and into the fire again.
you make me want to forget and start all over.
here i come straight out of my mind or worse.
another chance to get burned and start all over.
i am gonna start all over.

its so easy, you disrupt me, can not complain.
