saw you stretched out in room ten o nine.
with a smile on your face and a tear right in your eye.
oh, could not see to get a line on you, my sweet honey love.
berber jewlry jangling down the street.
making bloodshot eyes at evry woman that you meet.
could not seem to get a high on you, my sweet honey love.

may the good lord shine a light on you.
make every song you sing your favorite tune.
may the good lord shine a light on you.
warm like the evening sun.

when you are drunk in the alley, baby, with your clothes all torn.
and your late night friends leave you in the cold gray dawn.
just seemed too many flies on you, i just can not brush them off.
angels beating all their wings in time.
with smiles on their faces and a gleam right in their eyes.
whoa, thought i heard one sigh for you.
come on up, come on up, now, come on up now.

may the good lord shine a light on you.
make every song you sing your favorite tune.
may the good lord shine a light on you.
warm like the evening sun..
