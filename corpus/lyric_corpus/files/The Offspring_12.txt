three in the morning and i gotta be someplace.
i do not remember where.
friends try to make me stay or call me a cab home.
i grab my keys and a beer.

the cops they took my license away.
but i got my car out of impound today.
and i have been drunk since last saturday.
youd better stay outta my way.

i drink and drive.
feel so alive.
i will never take that dive.
feel so alive.
i am doing ninety five.
i drink and drive.
i feel so alive.
i drink and drive.

early morning and the freeways deserted.
like its all mine.
i am trying to set a new driving speed record.
but i can not drive a straight line.
flashing lights.
split the night.
i am tossing bottles as i swerve to the right.
now i have slammed my face into the back of a big rig.
at least you will never catch me you fucking pigs.

i drink and drive.
feel so alive.
i will never take that dive.
feel so alive.
i am doing ninety five.
i drink and drive.
i feel so alive.
i drink and drive.

designate someone other than me.
i am so drunk i can hardly see.
another shot of jagger and i turn the key.
i got so many places to be.

when i am on a binge, my friends all cringe.
they will not drive at night.
cause down at the freeway its such a fright.
but i think i drive alright.
