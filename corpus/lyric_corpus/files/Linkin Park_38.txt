in this farewell.
theres no blood.
theres no alibi.
cause i have drawn regret.
from the truth.
of a thousand lies.

so let mercy come.
and wash away...

what i have done.
i will face myself.
to cross out what i have become.
erase myself.
and let go of what i have done.

put to rest.
what you thought of me.
while i clean this slate.
with the hands.
of uncertainty.

so let mercy come.
and wash away...

what i have done.
i will face myself.
to cross out what i have become.
erase myself.
and let go of what i have done.

for what i have done.

i will start again.
and whatever pain may come.
today this ends.
i am forgiving what i have done.

i will face myself.
to cross out what i have become.
erase myself.
and let go of what i have done.
what i have done.

forgiving what i have done.
