verse 1.
this relationship is over.
though my stomach still hurts.
and now i am grown a little older.
why is the pain much worse?
you look so much better without makeup.
why would you hide your face?
do not want to spend the night and wake up.
realize you have made a big mistake.

chorus.
i cannot refuse your eyes.
please do not look at me tonight.
my heart beats fast i know you are there.
i pretend like i do not care.
it hurts so bad to know the truth.
but i am still in love with you.

verse 2.
i never meant to keep you waiting.
and now your food is getting cold.
i keep denying i am in love with you.
my routine is getting old.
and now you stand in front of the table.
and say you never look back.
do something stupid when you are angry.
you only wake up sad.

chorus.
i cannot refuse your eyes.
please do not look at me tonight.
my heart beats fast i know you are there.
i pretend like i do not care.
it hurts so bad to know the truth.
but girl still in love with you.
it hurts too much to know the truth.
but girl still in love with you.

no more kisses on your lips, tender touch or...
id rather die on my two feet than live down on my knees.
and you are the girl to get me opened up as far to bleed.
and i just can not get over you, until you are over me.

chorus.
i cannot refuse your eyes.
please do not look at me tonight.
my heart beats fast i know you are there.
and i pretend like i do not care.

and i can not refuse your eyes.
please do not look at me tonight.
my heart beats fast i know you are there.
i pretend like i do not care.

it hurts too much to know the truth.
but girl i am still in love with you.
it hurts too much to know the truth.
but girl, i am still in love with you..
