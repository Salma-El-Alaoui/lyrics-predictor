many nights we prayed.
with no proof anyone could hear.
in our hearts a hope for a song.
we barely understood.
now we are not afraid.
although we know theres much to fear.
we were moving mountains.
long before we knew we could, whoa, yes.

there can be miracles.
when you believe.
though hope is frail.
its hard to kill.
who knows what miracles.
you can achieve.
when you believe somehow you will.
you will when you believe.

mmmmmmmmmyeahmmmyeah.

in this time of fear.
when prayer so often proves in vain.
hope seems like the summer bird.
too swiftly flown away.
yet now im standing here.
my hearts so full, i cant explain.
seeking faith and speakin words.
i never thought id say.

there can be miracles.
when you believe when you believe.

who knows what miracles.
you can achieve you can achieve.
when you believe somehow you will.
you will when you believe.

hey.
ooh.

they dont always happen when you ask.
and its easy to give in to your fears.
but when youre blinded by your pain.
cant see the way, get through the rain.
a small but still, resilient voice.
says hope is very near, oh oh.

there can be miracles miracles.
