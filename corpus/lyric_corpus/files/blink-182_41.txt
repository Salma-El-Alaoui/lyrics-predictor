hanging out behind the club on the weekends.
acting stupid, getting drunk with my best friends.
i could not wait for the summer and the warped tour.
i remember that its the first time that i saw her there.

shes getting kicked out of school cause shes failing.
i am kinda nervous, cause i think all her friends hate me.
shes the one, she will always be there.
she took my hand and i made it i swear.

because i fell in love with the girl at the rock show.
she said quotwhat?quot and i told her that i did not know.
shes so cool, gonna sneak in through her window.
everythings better when shes around.
ca not wait until her parents go out of town.

i remember the look her mother gave us.
17 without a purpose or direction.
we do not owe anyone a fuckin explanation.
