friday night you and your boys went out to eat.
then they hung out.
but you came home around three.
if six of yall went out.
then four of you were really cheap.
cause only two of you had dinner.
i found your credit card receipt.

chorus 1.
its not right.
but its okay.
i am gonna make it anyway.
pack your bags up and leave.
do not you dare come running back to me.
its not right.
but its okay.
i am gonna make it anyway.
close the door behind you.
leave your key.
id rather be alone.
than unhappy.

i will pack your bags.
so you can leave town for a week.
the phone rings.
and then you look at me.
you said it was one of your friends.
down on 54th st.
so why did 213.
show up on your caller i.d.

chorus 2.
i have been through all of this before.
so how could you think.
that i would stand around.
and take some more.
things are gonna change.
thats why you have to leave.
so do not turn around to see my face.
theres no more tears left here.
for you to see.

was it really worth you going out like that.
see i am moving on.
and i refuse to turn back.
see all of this time.
i thought i had somebody down for me.
it turns out.
you were making a fool of mee.

chorus1 5x until fade.
