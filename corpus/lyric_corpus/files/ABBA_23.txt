i know just how to whisper.
and i know just how to cry.
i know just where to find the answers.
and i know just how to lie.

i know just how to fake it.
and i know just how to scheme.
i know just when to face the truth.

and then i know just when to dream.
and i know just where to touch you.
and i know just what to prove.

i know when to pull you closer.
and i know when to let you loose.
and i know the night is fading.
and i know that times gonna fly.
and i am never gonna tell you.
evrything i have got to tell you.

but i know i have got to give it a try.
and i know the roads to riches.
and i know the ways to fame.
i know all the rules and then i.
know how to break them.
and i always know the name of the game.
but i do not know how to leave you.
and i will never let you fall.
and i do not know how you do it.

ring ring   why do not you give me a call?. . . .
evry time i see you all the rays of the sun.
are streaming through the waves in your hair.
and evry star in the sky is.
taking aim at your eyes.
like a spotlight.
the beating of my heart is a drum.

and its lost and its looking.
for a rhythm like you.
you can take the darkness from the pit of the night.
and turn into a beacon burning endlessly bright.
i have got to follow it.
cause evrything i know.

well.
its nothing til i give it to you.
i can make the run or stumble.
i can make the final block.
and i can make every tackle.
at the sound of the whistle.

i can make all the stadiums rock.
i can make tonight forever.

or i can make it disappear by the dawn.
and i can make you every promise.
that has ever been made.

and i can make all your demons be gone.
with god i will never gonna make it without you.

do you really want to see me crawl ?

and i never gonna make it like you do.
