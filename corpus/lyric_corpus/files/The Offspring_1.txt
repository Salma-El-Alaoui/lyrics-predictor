deep inside your soul theres a hole you do not wanna see.
every single day what you say makes no sense to me.
even though i try i can not get my head around you.

somewhere in the night theres a light in front of me.
heaven up above with a shove, abandons me.
even though i try i fall in the river of you.
you have managed to bring me down too.

all your faking get up, get up, get up, get up.
shows you are aching get up, get up, get up.

every single day what you say makes no sense to me.
letting you inside, is not right, do not mess with me.
i never really know whats really going on inside you.
i can not get my head around you.

all your feeding get up, get up, get up, get up.
shows you are bleeding get up, get up, get up.

deep inside your soul theres a hole you do not wanna see.
covering it up like a cut with the likes of me.
you know i have really tried, i can not do anymore about you.

yeaaahh.
the cuts getting deeper.
yeaaahh.
the hills getting steeper.
yeaaahh.
i guess i will never know whats really going on inside you.
i can not get my head around you.
i can not get my head around you.
i can not get my head around you.
i can not get my head around you.
