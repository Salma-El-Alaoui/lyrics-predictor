oh my love.

oh yeah ...

oh yeah...

i am sitting here alone up in my room.
and thinking about the times that we have been through.
oh my love.
i am looking at a picture in my hand.
trying my best to understand.
i really wanna know what we did wrong.
with a love that felt so strong.
if only you were here tonight.
i know that we could make it right.

chorus.
i do not know how to live without your love.
i was born to make you happy.
cause you are the only one within my heart.
i was born to make you happy.
always and forever you and me.
thats the way our life should be.
i do not know how to live without your love.
i was born to make you happy.

i know i have been a fool since you have been gone.
i better give it up and then carry on oh my love.
cause living in a dream of you and me.
is not the way my life should be.
i do not wanna cry a tear for you, so forgive me if i do.
if only you were here tonight.
i know that we could make it right.

chorus.
i do not know how to live without your love.
i was born to make you happy.
cause you are the only one within my heart.
i was born to make you happy.
always and forever you and me.
thats the way our life should be.
i do not know how to live without your love.
i was born to make you happy.

oh yeah ...

id do anything.
id give you my world.
id wait forever to be your girl.
just call out my name just call out my name.
and i will be there and i will be there.
just to show you how much i care.

alright.
i was born to make you happy.
yeah, yeah ...
oh yeah, yeah.

chorus.
i do not know how to live without your love.
i was born to make you happy.
cause you are the only one within my heart.
i was born to make you happy.
always and forever you and me.
thats the way our life should be.
i do not know how to live without your love.
i was born to make you happy.

oh no, no.
i was born to make you happy.
oh yeah, oh oh yeah.

always and forever you and me.
thats the way our life should be.
i do not know how to live without your love.
i was born to make you happy.
