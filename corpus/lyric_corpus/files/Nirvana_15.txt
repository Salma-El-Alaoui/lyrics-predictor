its so relieving.
to know that you are leaving as soon as you get paid.
its so relaxing.
to hear that you are asking wherever you get your way.
its so soothing.
to know that you will sue me, this is starting to sound the same.

i miss the comfort in being sad.
i miss the comfort in being sad.
i miss the comfort in being sad.

in her false witness, we hope you are still with us.
to see if they float or drown.
our favorite patient, a display of patience.
disease covered puget sound.
she will come back as fire, to burn all the liars.
and leave a blanket of ash on the ground.

i miss the comfort in being sad.
i miss the comfort in being sad.
i miss the comfort in being sad.

its so relieving.
to know that you are leaving as soon as you get paid.
its so relaxing.
to know that you are asking wherever you get your way.
its so soothing.
to know that you will sue me, this is starting to sound the same.

i miss the comfort in being sad.
i miss the comfort in being sad.
i miss the comfort in being sad.
