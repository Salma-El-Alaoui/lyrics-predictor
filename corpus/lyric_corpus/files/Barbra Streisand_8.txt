do not tell me not to live, just sit and putta.
lifes candy and the suns a ball of butter.
do not bring around a cloud to rain on my parade.

do not tell me not to fly, i simply got to.
if someone takes a spill, its me and not you.
who told you you are allowed to rain on my parade.

i will march my band out, i will beat my drum.
and if i am fanned out, your turn at bat, sir.
at least i did not fake it, hat, sir.
i guess i did not make it.

but whether i am the rose of sheer perfection.
a freckle on the nose of lifes complexion.
the cinder or the shiny apple of its eye.

i gotta fly once, i gotta try once.
only can die once, right, sir?
ooh, life is juicy, juicy and you see.
i gotta have my bite, sir.

get ready for me love, cause i am a comer.
i simply gotta march, my hearts a drummer.
do not bring around a cloud to rain on my parade.

i am gonna live and live now!
get what i want, i know how!
one roll for the whole shebang!
one throw that bell will go clang.
eye on the target and wham.
one shot, one gun shot and bam!
hey, mr. arnstein, here i am.

i will march my band out, i beat my drum.
and if i am fanned out, your turn at bat, sir.
at least i did not fake it, hat, sir.
i guess i did not make it.

get ready for me love, cause i am a comer.
i simply gotta march, my hearts a drummer.
nobody, no nobody, is gonna rain on my parade!
