well i have got some scattered pictures lying on my bedroom floor.
reminds me of the times we shared.
makes me wish that you were here.
now it seems i have forgotten my purpose in this life.
all the songs have been erased.
guess i have learned from my mistakes.

open the past and present now and we are there.
story to tell and i am listening.
open the past and present and the future too.
its all i have got and i am giving it to you.

loose ends tied in knots leaving a lump down in my throat.
gagging on a souvenir.
lodged to fill another year.
drag it on and on until my skin is ripped to shreds.
leaving my self open wide.
living out a sacrifice.

if you got no one and i got no place to go.
would it be alright? could it be alright?
