la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

i wrote her off for the tenth time today.
and practiced all the things i would say.
but she came over, i lost my nerve.
i took her back and made her dessert.

now i know i am being used.
thats okay, man, cause i like the abuse.
i know shes playing with me.
thats ok cause i got no self esteem.

oh, yeah, yeah.
oh, yeah, yeah.
oh, yeah, yeah.
oh, yeah, yeah.

we make plans to go out at night.
i wait till two then i turn out the light.
all this rejections got me so low.
if she keeps it up i just might tell her so.

oh, yeah, yeah.
oh, yeah, yeah.
oh, yeah, yeah.
oh, yeah, yeah.

when shes saying that she wants only me.
then i wonder why she sleeps with my friends.
when shes saying that i am like a disease.
then i wonder how much more i can stand.
well i guess, i should stick up for myself.
but i really think its better this way.
the more you suffer, the more it shows you really care.
right?
yeah!

now i will relate this a little bit.
that happens more than id like to admit.
late at night she knocks on my door.
shes drunk again and looking to score.

now i know i should say no.
but its kind of hard when shes ready to go.
i may be dumb, but i am not a dweeb.
i am just a sucker with no self esteem.

oh, yeah, yeah.
oh, yeah, yeah.
oh, yeah, yeah.
oh, yeah, yeah.
