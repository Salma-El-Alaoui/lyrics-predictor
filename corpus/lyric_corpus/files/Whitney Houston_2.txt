i used to cry myself to sleep at night.
but that was all.
before he came.
i thought love had to hurt to turn out right.
but now hes here.
its not the same.
its not the same.

chorus.
he fills me up.
he gives me love.
more love than i have ever seen.
hes all i have got.
hes all i have got in this world.
but hes all the man that i need.

and in the morning when i kiss his eyes.
he takes me down.
and rocks me slow.
and in the evening when the moon is high.
he holds me close.
and will not let go.
he will not let go.

chorus.
