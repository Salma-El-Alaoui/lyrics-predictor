in the streets of new york city.
evry man can feel the cold.
and i do not want no pity.
but i want my story told.

when the lights shine down on me.
they shine on the little boy.
is this way to make him pay.
beng born in a world of joy.

but like me.
he do not know where he will go wrong.
he will not cry so many tears.
till he finds out why he do not belong like me.

theres no room for us out there.
you can lose your hope and pride.
when it comes to broken dreams.
you will get your share.
sometime a man breaks down.
and the good thing he is looking for.
are crushed into the ground.

get on up, look around.
ca not you feel the wind of change?
get on up, taste the air.
ca not you see the wind of change.

do not you understand what i am saying.
we need a god down there.
a man to lead us children.
take us from the valley of fear.

make the lights shine down on us.
show us the road to go.
help us survive, make us arrive.
teach us what we need to know.

but like me.
he do not know where he will go wrong.
he will not cry so many tears.
till he finds out why he do not belong like me.

theres no room for us out there.
you can lose your hope and pride.
when it comes to broken dreams.
you will get your share.
sometime a man breaks down.
and the good thing he is looking for.
are crushed into the ground.

get on up, look around.
ca not you feel the wind of change?
get on up, taste the air.
ca not you see the wind of change.

get on up ....
