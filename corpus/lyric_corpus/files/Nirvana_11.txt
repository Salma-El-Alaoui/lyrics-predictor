i am not like them.
but i can pretend.
the sun is gone.
but i have a light.
the day is done.
but i am having fun.
i think i am dumb.
or maybe just happy.

think i am just happy.
think i am just happy.
think i am just happy.

my heart is broke.
but i have some glue.
help me inhale.
and mend it with you.
we will float around.
and hang out on clouds.
then we will come down.
and have a hangover.

have a hangover.
have a hangover.
have a hangover.

skin the sun.
fall asleep.
wish away.
the soul is cheap.
lesson learned.
wish me luck.
soothe the burn.
wake me up.
