road tripping with my two favorite allies.
fully loaded we got snacks and supplies.
its time to leave this town, its time to steal away.

let us go get lost, let us go get lost...

blue you sit so pretty west of the one.
sparkle light with yellow icing just a mirror for the sun.
just a mirror for the sun.
just a mirror for the sun.
these smiling eyes are just a mirror for...

so much as come before those battles lost and won.
this life is shining more forever in the sun.
now let us check our heads and let us check the surf.

just a mirror for the sun.
just a mirror for the sun.
these smiling eyes are just a mirror for...

we three hunky dorys got our snakefinger on.
now let us drink the stars, its time to steal away.
let us go get lost right here in the u.s.a.
let us go get lost, let us go get lost...

blue you sit so pretty west of the one.
sparkle light with yellow icing just a mirror for the sun.

just a mirror for the sun.
just a mirror for the sun.
these smiling eyes are just a mirror for...
these smiling eyes are just a mirror for...
your smiling eyes are just a mirror for....
