i can be your liar.
i can be your bearer of bad news.
sick and uninspired by.
the diamonds in your fire.
burning like a flame inside of you.
but is this just desire or the truth?
so shame on me for the ruse.
shame on me for the blues.
another one returned that i will never use.
but i will not go getting tired of you.
i will not go getting tired of you.
i am not getting tired.
i will not go getting tired of you.
i will not go getting tired of you.
i am not getting tired.
hanging on this wire.
waiting for the day i have to choose.
cursed by love so dire.
one more boy for hire.
one more boy to lend a hand to you.
is this just desire or the truth?
so shame on me for the ruse.
shame on me for the blues.
another one returned that i will never use.
but i will not go getting tired of you.
i will not go getting tired of you.
i am not getting tired.
i will not go getting tired of you.
i will not go getting tired of you.
i am not getting tired.
of you.
you.
i can be your liar.
i can be your bearer of bad news.
sick and uninspired by.
the diamonds in your fire.
burning like a flame inside of you.
is this just desire or the truth?
so shame on me for the ruse.
shame on me for the blues.
another one returned that i will never use.
but i will not go getting tired of you.
i will not go getting tired of you.
i am not getting tired.
i will not go getting tired of you.
i will not go getting tired of you.
i am not getting tired.
of you.
