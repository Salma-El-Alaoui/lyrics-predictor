you have been alone.
you have been afraid.
i have been a fool in so many ways.
but i would change my life if you thought you might try to love me.
so please give me another chance to write you another song and take back those things i have done.
cause i will give you my heart if you would let me start all over again.

i am not a saint.
i am just a man who had heaven and earth in the palm of his hand.
but i threw it away.
so now i stand here today asking forgiveness.
and if you could just please give me another chance to write you another song and take back those things i have done.
cause i will give you my heart if you would let me start all over again.

little girl, you are all i have got.
do not you leave me standing here once again.
cause i will give you my life.
yes, i would, if you would let me try to let me love you.
so please give me another chance to write you another song and take back those things i have done.
cause i will give you my heart if you would let me start all over again.

...again.
you know i love you.
give me one more chance.
