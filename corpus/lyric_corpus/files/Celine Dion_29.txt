do not think i can not feel that theres something wrong.
you have been the sweetest part of my life so long.
i look in your eyes, theres a distant light.
and you and i know there will be a storm tonight.
this is getting serious.
are you thinking bout you or us.

chorus.
do not say what you are about to say.
look back before you leave my life.
be sure before you close that door.
before you roll those dice.
baby think twice.

baby think twice for the sake of our love, for the memory.
for the fire and the faith that was you and me.
baby i know it aingt easy when your soul cries out for a higher ground.
coz when you are halfway up, you are always halfway down.
but baby this is serious.
are you thinking bout you or us.

repeat first chorus.

breakdown.
baby this is serious this is serious.
are you thinking bout you or us.
baby.

do not say what you are about to say no no no no.
look back before you leave my life do not leave my life.
be sure before you close that door.
before you roll those dice.
baby think twice.


do not do what you are about to do.
my everything depends on you.
whatever it takes, i will sacrifice.
before you roll those dice.

repeat second chorus.
