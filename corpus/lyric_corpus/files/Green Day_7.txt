i walk a lonely road.
the only one that i have ever known.
do not know where it goes.
but its home to me and i walk alone.

i walk this empty street.
on the boulevard of broken dreams.
where the city sleeps.
and i am the only one and i walk alone.

i walk alone.
i walk alone.

i walk alone.
i walk a...

my shadows the only one that walks beside me.
my shallow hearts the only thing thats beating.
sometimes i wish someone out there will find me.
til then i walk alone.

ah ah, ah ah, ah ah, aaah ah.
ah ah, ah ah, ah ah.

i am walking down the line.
that divides me somewhere in my mind.
on the border line.
of the edge and where i walk alone.

read between the lines.
whats fucked up and everythings alright.
check my vital signs.
to know i am still alive and i walk alone.

i walk alone.
i walk alone.

i walk alone.
i walk a...

my shadows the only one that walks beside me.
my shallow hearts the only thing thats beating.
sometimes i wish someone out there will find me.
til then i walk alone.

ah ah, ah ah, ah ah, aaah ah.
ah ah, ah ah.

i walk alone.
i walk a...

i walk this empty street.
on the boulevard of broken dreams.
where the city sleeps.
and i am the only one and i walk a...

my shadows the only one that walks beside me.
my shallow hearts the only thing thats beating.
sometimes i wish someone out there will find me.
til then i walk alone....
