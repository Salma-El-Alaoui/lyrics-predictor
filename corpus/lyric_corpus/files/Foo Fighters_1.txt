all my life i have been searching for something.
something never comes, never leads to nothing.
nothing satisfies, but i am getting close.
closer to the prize at the end of the rope.

all night long i dream of the day.
when it comes around, and its taken away.
leaves me with the feeling that i feel the most.
i feel it come to life when i see your ghost.

come down do not you resist.
you have such a delicate wrist.
and if i give it a twist.
something to hold when i lose my grip.
will i find something in that.
so give me just what i need.
another reason to bleed.
one by one hidden up my sleeve, one by one hidden up my sleeve.

hey, do not let it go to waste.
i love it but i hate that taste.
weight keeping me down.

hey, do not let it go to waste.
i love it but i hate that taste.
weight keeping me down.

will i find the believer?
another one who believes.
another one to deceive.
over and over down on my knees.

if i get any closer.
and if you open up wide.
and if you let me inside.
on and on i got nothing to hide, on and on i got nothing to hide.

hey, do not let it go to waste.
i love it but i hate that taste.
weight keeping me down.

hey, do not let it go to waste.
i love it but i hate that taste.
weight keeping me down.

and i am done, done onto the next one.
done, done and i am onto the next one.
done, done and i am onto the next one.
done, done and i am onto the next one.
done, done and i am onto the next one.
done, done and i am onto the next one.
done, done and i am onto the next one.
done, i am done and i am onto the next.

done, done onto the next one!
done, i am done and i am on to the next one!
done, done onto the next one!
done, i am done and i am on to the next one!
