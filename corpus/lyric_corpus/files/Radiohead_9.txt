i am the key to the lock in your house.
that keeps your toys in the basement.
and if you get too far inside.
you will only see my reflection.

its always best when the colour is off.
i am the pick in the ice.
do not cry out or hit the alarm.
you know we are friends till we die.

but either way you turn.
i will be there.
open up your skull.
i will be there.
climbing up the walls.

its always best when the light is off.
its always better on the outside.
fifteen blows to the back of my head.
fifteen blows to your mind.
so lock the kids in a safe tonight.
shut the eyes in the cupboard.
i have got the smell of a local man.
whos got the loneliest feeling.

but either way you turn.
i will be there.
open up your skull.
i will be there.
climbing up the walls.

climbing up the walls.
climbing up the walls.
