your daddy works in porno.
now that mommys not around.
she used to love her heroin.
but now shes underground.

so you stay out late at night.
and you do your coke for free.
driving your friends crazy.
with your lifes insanity.

well, well, well, you just can not tell.
well, well, well, my michelle.
look out.

sowing all your wild oats.
in anothers luxuries.
yesterday was tuesday.
maybe thursday you can sleep.

but school starts much too early.
and this hotel was not free.
so party till your connection calls.
honey, i will return the key.

well, well, well, you just can not tell.
well, well, well, my michelle.
well, well, well, you never can tell.
well, well, well, my michelle.

evryone needs love.
you know that its true.
someday you will find someone.
that will fall in love with you.

but oh the time it takes.
when you are all alone.
someday you will find someone.
that you can call your own.
but till then you better.

now you are clean and so discreet.
i will not say a word.
but most of all this song is true.
case you have not heard.

so cmon and stop your crying.
we both now money burns.
honey do not stop trying.
and you will get what you deserve.

well, well, well, you just can not tell.
well, well, well, my michelle.
well, well, well, you never can tell.
well, well, well, my michelle.

my, my, my michelle.
my, my, my michelle.
ooh, my, my, my michelle.
my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my michelle.
michelle.
