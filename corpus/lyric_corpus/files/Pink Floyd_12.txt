overhead the albatross hangs motionless upon the air.
and deep beneath the rolling waves.
in labyrinths of coral caves.
the echo of a distant time.
comes willowing across the sand.
and everything is green and submarine.

and no one showed us to the land.
and no one knows the where or whys.
but something stirs and something tries.
and starts to climb towards the light.

strangers passing in the street.
by chance two separate glances meet.
and i am you and what i see is me.
and do i take you by the hand.
and lead you through the land.
and help me understand the best i can.

and no one calls us to move on.
and no one forces down our eyes.
and no one speaks and no one tries.
and no one flies around the sun.

cloudless everyday you fall upon my waking eyes.
inviting and inciting me to rise.
and through the window in the wall.
come streaming in on sunlight wings.
a million bright ambassadors of morning.

and no one sings me lullabies.
and no one makes me close my eyes.
so i throw the windows wide.
and call to you across the sky.
