her face is cracked from smiling, all the fears that shes been hiding.
and it seems pretty soon everybodys gonna know.

and her voice is sore from shouting, cheering winners who are losing.
and she worries if their days are few and soon they will have to go.

my my my, i am so happy.
i am gonna join the band.
we gonna dance and sing in celebration.
we are in the promised land.

she hears them talk of new ways to protect the home she lives in.
then she wonders what its all about when they break down the door.

her name is brown or white or black, you know her very well.
you hear her cries of mercy as the winners toll the bell.

my my my, i am so happy.
i am gonna join the band.
we gonna dance and sing in celebration.
we are in the promised land.

there is a train that leaves the station, heading for your destination.
but the price you pay to nowhere has increased a dollar more.
yes, it has!

and if you walk you are gonna get there, although it takes a little longer.
when you see it in the distance you will wring your hands and moan.
