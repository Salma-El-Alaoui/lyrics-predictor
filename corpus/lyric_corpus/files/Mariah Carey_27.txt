it was not raining yet.
but it was definitely getting a little misty on.
that warm november night.
and my heart was pounding.
my inner voice resounding.
begging me to turn away.
but i just had to see your face.
to feel alive.

and then you casually walked in the room.
and i was twisted in the web.
of my desire for you.
and i was twisted.
my apprehension blew away.
i only wanted you.
to taste my sadness.
as you kissed me in the dark.

chorus.
every time i feel the need.
i envision you caressing me.
and go back in time.
to relive the splendor of you and i.
on the rooftop that rainy night.

and so we finished the moet and.
i started feeling liberated.
and i surrendered as you took me.
in your arms.
i was so caught up in the moment.
i could not bear to let you go yet.
so i threw caution to the wind.
and started listening to my longing heart.

and then you softly pressed your lips to mine.
and the feelings surfaced id surpressed.
for such a long time.
and i was lifted.
and for awhile i forgot.
the sorrow and the pain.
and melted with you as we stood.
there in the rain.

chorus 2x.

last night i dreamed that i.
whispered the words i love you.
and touched you so very.
subtly as we were kissing goodbye.
pretty baby    how i am missing you.

every time i feel the need.
i envision you caressing me.
envision you caressing me.
and go back in time.
i go back.
to relive the splendor of you and i.
on the rooftop that rainy night.
on the roof that rainy night.

every time i feel the need.
when i feel the need.
i envision you caressing me.
i envision you over and over and over again.
and go back in time.
to relive the splendor of you and i.
it was oh so sweet, you and i.
on the rooftop that rainy night.
on that rainy night.

every time i feel the need.
last night i had the strangest dream ... .
i envision you caressing me.
it was actually quite symbolic.
and i go back in time.
as i whispered ... that i loved you.
to relive the splendor of you and i.
 ... very subtly.

chorus 1x.
