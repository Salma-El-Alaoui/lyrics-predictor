i stand in the distance, i view from afar.
should i offer some assistance.
should it matter who you are.
we all get hurt by love, and we all have our cross to bear.
but in the name of understanding, now.
our problems should be shared.
confide in me, confide in me.

i can keep a secret and throw away the key.
but sometimes to release it is to set our children free.
we all get hurt by love, and we all have our cross to bear.
but in the name of understanding now.
our problems should be shared.
confide in me, confide in me.
confide in me, confide in me.
confide in me, confide in me.
confide in me.
confide in me, confide in me.
confide in me.

stick or twist, the choice is yours.
hit or miss, whats mine is yours.
stick or twist, the choice is yours.
hit or miss, whats mine is yours.

we all get hurt by love, and we all have our cross to bear.
but in the name of understanding now.
our problems should be shared.
confide in me, confide in me.
confide in me, confide in me.

confide in me, confide in me.
confide in me, confide in me.
confide in me.
confide in me, confide in me.
confide in me, confide in me.
confide in me.

repeat.
