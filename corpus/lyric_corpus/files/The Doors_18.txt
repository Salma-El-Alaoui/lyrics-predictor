time to live.
time to lie.
time to laugh.
time to die.

take it easy, baby.
take it as it comes.
do not move too fast.
if you want your love to last.
oh, you have been moving much too fast.

time to walk.
time to run.
time to aim your arrows.
at the sun.

take it easy baby.
take it as it comes.
do not move too fast.
if you want your love to last.
oh, you have been moving much too fast.

go real slow.
you will like it more and more.
take it as it comes.
specialize in having fun.

take it easy baby.
take it as it comes.
do not move too fast.
if you want your love to last.
oh you have been moving much too fast.
moving much too fast.
moving much too fast.
