i am taking all you down with me.
explosives duct taped to my spine.
nothings gonna change my mind.
i will not listen to anyones last words.
theres nothing left for you to say.
soon you will be dead any way.

no one here is getting out alive.
this time i have really lost my mind and i do not care.
so close your eyes.
and kiss yourself goodbye.
and think about the times.
you spent and what they have meant.

to me its nothing.
to me its nothing.
to me its nothing.
to me its nothing.

i am losing all my happiness.
the happiness you pinned on my.
loneliness still comforts me.
my anger dwells inside of me.
i am taking it all out on you and all the shit you put me through.

no one here is getting out alive.
this time i have really lost my mind and i do not care.
so close your eyes.
and kiss yourself goodbye.
and think about the times.
you spent and what they have meant.

to me its nothing.
to me its nothing.
to me its nothing.
to me its nothing.

do you ever think back to another time?
does it bring you so down that you thought you lost your mind?
do you ever want to lead a long trail of destruction and now down.
any bullshit that confronts you?
do you ever build up all the small things in your head.
to make one problem that adds up to nothing.
to me its nothing.
to me its nothing.
to me its nothing.
