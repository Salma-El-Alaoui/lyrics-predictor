well, i got a friend whos a man.
whos a man?
the man who keeps me from the lovely.
he gives me what i need.
what you need? what you got?
i need it all so badly.

oh, anything i want he gives it to me.
anything i want he gives it, but not for free.
its hateful.
and its paid for and i am so grateful to be nowhere.

this year i have lost some friends.
some friends? what friends?
i dunno, i aingt even noticed.

you see, i gotta go out again.
again? my friend.
i gotta see that mainman.

i killed all my nerves.
my nerves? what swerves?
and i can not drive so steady.

i have lost my memory.
my mind? behind!
i can not see so clearly.

chorus.
