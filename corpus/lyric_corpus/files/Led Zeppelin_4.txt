i caught you smiling at me.
thats the way it should be.
like a leaf is to a tree so fine.

ah all the good times we had.
i sang love songs so glad.
always smiling never sad so fine.

as we walk down a country lane.
i will be singing a song.
hear me calling your name.
hear the whisper in the trees.
telling mother nature bout you and me.

well, if the sunshines so bright.
or on our way its darkest night.
the road we choose is always right so fine.

ah can your love be so strong.
when so many loves go wrong.
will our love go on and on and on and on and on and on.

as we walk down a country lane.
i will be singing a song.
hear me calling your name.
hear the whisper in the trees.
telling mother nature bout you and me.

my my, la de la, come on now it aingt too far.
tell your friends all around the world.
aingt no companion like a blue eyed merle.
come on now well let me tell you.
what you are missing missing round them brick walls.

so, of one thing i am sure.
its a friendship so pure.
angels singing all around my door so fine.
yeah, aingt but one thing to do.
spend my natural life with you.
you are the finest dog i knew so fine.

when you are old and your eyes are dim.
there aingt no old shep gonna happen again.
we will still go walking down country lanes.
i will sing the same old songs.
hear me call your name..
