johnny come lately on a saturday night.
singing how de do.
backstreet a boogie in the house of delight.
where they steal the show.
the money come sour but the ladies are sweet.
its a love affair.
whole place rocking people stomping their feet.
a when the gangs all there.

he gets his woman every night for free.
hes out there rocking like you would not believe.
i sing na na na na na.
na na na na na.

johnny like to gamble with his lady louise.
she was a black jack deuces are wild.
he got to thinking bout his nose in the breeze.
put it there johnny looked and he smiled.
he started thinking bout the fortune and fame.
with the young girls down at his knees.
he dug the money but forgot all the names.
so he knew just how to appease.

lick and a promise.

lick and a promise.
he gave the ladies a.
lick and a promise.

he grabbed a guitar and a couple a beers.

he gets his woman every night for free.
hes out there rocking like you would not believe.
