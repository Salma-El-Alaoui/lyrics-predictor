oh no, pop is dead.
long live pop.
it died an ugly death.
by back catalogue.

and know you know it gets you nowhere.
and now you know you realise.

oh no, pop is dead.
it just gave up.
we raise the dead but they will not stand up.

and radio have salmonella.
and now you know you gotta die.
it left this message for us.

so what, pop is dead, its no great loss.
so many face lifts, its face flew off.

the emperor he has no clothes on.
and his skin is pealing off.

oh no, pop is dead, long live pop.
one final lot of coke to jack him off...
jack him off.. he left this message for us.
