i got the feeling the feelings gone.
my heart has gone to sleep.
one of these mornings i will be gone.
my heart belongs to me.

can we believe in fairytales?
can love survive when all else fails?
ca not hide the feeling the feelings gone.
my heart belongs to me.

but now my love, hey did not i love you.
but we knew what had to be.
somehow my love, i will always love you.
but my heart belongs to me.

put out the light and close your eyes.
come lie beside me.
do not ask why.
ca not hide the feeling the feelings gone.
my heart belongs to me.

girls.
but now my love, hey did not i love you.
did not i love you.
did not i love you.
did not i love you, baby.

do not cry my love.
i will always love you.
but my heart belongs to me.

i got the feeling the feelings gone.
my heart belongs to me.

did not i love you, did not i love you..
