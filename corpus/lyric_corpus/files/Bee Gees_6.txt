shadows falling , baby , we stand alone.
out on the street anybody you meet got a heartache of their own.
make it a crime to be lonely or sad.
you got a reason for living.
you battle on with the love you are living on.
you gotta be mine.
we take it away.
its gotta be night and day.
just a matter of time.

and we got nothing to be guilty of.
our love will climb any mountain near or far , we are.
and we never let it end.
we are devotion.
and we got nothing to be sorry for.
our love is one in a million.
eyes can see that we got a highway to the sky.
do not wanna hear your goodbye.

pulses racing , darling.
how grand we are.
little by little we meet in the middle.
theres danger in the dark.
make it a crime to be out in the cold.
you got a reason for living.
you battle on with the love you are building on.
you gotta be mine.
we take it away.
its gotta be night and day.
just a matter of time.

and we got nothing to be guilty of.
our love will climb any mountain near or far , we are.
and we never let it end.
we are devotion.
and we got nothing to be sorry for.
our love is one in a million.
eyes can see that we got a highway to the sky.
do not wanna hear your goodbye.
do not wanna hear your.

and we got nothing to be guilty of.
our love will climb any mountain near or far , we are.
and we never let it end.
we are devotion.
and we got nothing to be sorry for.
our love is one in a million.
eyes can see that we got a highway to the sky.
do not wanna hear your goodbye.
do not wanna hear your.

and we got nothing to be guilty of  fade .
