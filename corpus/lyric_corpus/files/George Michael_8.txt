one day you say you love me.
the next you tell me you do not.
one day you say you will.
and the next you tell me you will not.
hey little baby.
there aingt much point in hanging around yea.
one day you make me feel like your love is in my hands.
one day you say you will stay.
the next you are changing your plans.
hey little baby.
aingt much point in hanging around yea.
cause if you aingt got time for me i will find another fantasy.

it is kind of funny that you think that.
i am the boy to make you cry.
i can make you happy.
if only for a while.
little baby i can give you all the loving that your heart desires.
if you aingt got time for me i will find another fantasy.

it could be the price of love.
could the price of hate.
what am i guilty of.
why do you make me wait.
so long i do not know your intentions.
look to the skys above.
i am in the hands of fate.
push till it gets to shove.
i have got to know for heavens sake.
is this love or invention.
baby can not you see i will find another fantasy.

you hang around with people who are sure to make you cry.
i can make you happy if only for a while.
little baby oh, oh little baby.
i can give you all the loving that your heart desires.
if you aingt got time for me i will find another fantasy.

you take someones heart.
and you kick it around.
keep on picking it up.
so you can watch it come down.
i do not know what i am suppose to do.
why i wait for you to make up your mind.
would you please be so kind.
when you know what to do i will be in the next room.
but if you make it to late i may be in the next day.
