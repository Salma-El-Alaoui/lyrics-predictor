i am gonna make a change.
for once in my life.
its gonna feel real good.
gonna make a difference.
gonna make it right . . .

as i, turn up the collar on my.
favourite winter coat.
this wind is blowing my mind.
i see the kids in the street.
with not enough to eat.
who am i, to be blind?
pretending not to see.
their needs.
a summers disregard.
a broken bottle top.
and a one mans soul.
they follow each other on.
the wind ya know.
cause they got nowhere to go.
thats why i want you to know.

i am starting with the man in the mirror.
i am asking him to change his ways.
and no message could have.
been any clearer.
if you wanna make the world.
a better place.
if you wanna make the.
world a better place.
take a look at yourself, and.
then make a change.
take a look at yourself, and.
then make a change.
na na na, na na na, na na, na nah.

i have been a victim of a selfish.
kind of love.
its time that i realize.
that there are some with no.
home, not a nickel to loan.
could it be really me.
pretending that they are not alone?

a willow deeply scarred.
somebodys broken heart.
and a washed out dream.
washed out dream.
they follow the pattern of.
the wind, ya see.
cause they got no place to be.
thats why i am starting with me.
starting with me!
