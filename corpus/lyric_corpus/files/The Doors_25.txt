at first flash of eden, we race down to the sea.
standing there on freedoms shore.

waiting for the sun. waiting for the sun. waiting for the.
sun.

can you feel it, now that spring has come?
that its time to live in the scattered sun.

waiting for the sun. waiting for the sun. waiting for the.
sun.
waiting for the sun.
waiting...

waiting for you to.
come along.

waiting for you to.
hear my song.

waiting for you to come along.
waiting for you to tell me what went wrong.

this is the strangest life i have ever known.

ca not you feel it, now that spring has come?
that its time to live in the scattered sun.

waiting for the sun. waiting for the sun. waiting for the.
sun. waiting for the sun.
