somebody keep my balance.
i think i am falling off.
into a state of regression.
the expiration date.
rapidly coming up.
its leaving me behind to rank.

always move forward.
going straight will get you nowhere.
there is no progress.
evolution kill it all.
i found my place in nowhere.

i am taking one step sideways.
leading with my crutch.
got a fucked up equilibrium.
count down from 9 to 5.
hooray! we are gonna die!
blessed into our extinction.

always move forward.
going straight will get you nowhere.
there is no progress.
evolution kill it all.
i found my place in nowhere.

always move forward.
going straight will get you nowhere.
there is no progress.
evolution kill it all.
i found my place in nowhere, in nowhere, in no o owhere.
