i believe in love, its all we got.
love has no boundaries, costs nothing to touch.
war makes money, cancer sleeps.
curled up in my father and that means something to me.
churches and dictators, politics and papers.
everything crumbles sooner or later.
but love, i believe in love.

i believe in love, its all we got.
love has no boundaries, no borders to cross.
love is simple, hate breeds.
those who think difference is the child of disease.
father and son make love and guns.
families together kill someone.
without love, i believe in love.

without love i would not believe.
in anything that lives and breathes.
without love id have no anger.
i would not believe in the right to stand here.
without love i would not believe.
i could not believe in you.
and i would not believe in me.
without love.

i believe in love.
i believe in love.
i believe in love.
