you said i was nothern scum.
i was wounded baby.
thats fighting talk where i am from.
and i am not moving baby.
spent my life dancing with shadows in strobe lights.
its allright, everything mellows in sunlight.

and now londons got its gimmicks.
and new yorks had its minute.
but knutsford city limits.
i will never change.

i have been running nearly all my life.
it left me broken baby.
when the meter ran out on life.
i used my tokens lady.
spent my life dancing with shadows in strobe lights.
its allright, everything mellows in sunlight.

and now londons got its gimmicks.
and new yorks had its minute.
but knutsford city limits.
i will never change.
