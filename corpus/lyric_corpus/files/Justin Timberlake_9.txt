she shuts the room down.
the way she walks and causes a fuss.

shes flawless like some uncut ice.
i hope shes going home with me tonight.

and all she wants is to dance.
thats why you will find her on the floor.
but you do not have a chance.
unless you move the way that she likes.
thats why shes going home with me tonight.

those flashing lights come from everywhere.
the way they hit her i just stop and stare.
