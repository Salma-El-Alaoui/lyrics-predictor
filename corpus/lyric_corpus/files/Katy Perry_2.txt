voted most likely to end up on the back of a milk box drink.
looks like i am letting them down.
cause seven, seventy five is not worth an hour of my hard work and time.
when you can not afford half the shit they advertise.
oh i am worth more then they ask for then the toe tag generation full of regret.
oh i will not settle no, oh i can not settle.

i wanna break the mold, i wanna break the stereotype.
fist in the air i am not going down with out a fight.
its my life and i am not sitting on the sidelines watching.
it pass me by.
i am leaving you my legacy.
i gotta make my mark.
i gotta run it hard.
i want you to remember me.
i am leaving my fingerprints.
i am leaving my fingerprints.
i am leaving my fingerprints on you.

representing you and me.
do not you wanna go down in history?
rather then end up begging on the streets.
trading under table favors for a place to sleep.
cause i am worth more then this so stop writing prescriptions for my ritalin.
i can not focus my attention.

i wanna break the mold, i wanna break the stereotype.
fist in the air i am not going down with out a fight.
its my life and i am not sitting on the sidelines watching.
it pass me by.
i am leaving you my legacy.
i gotta make my mark.
i gotta run it hard.
i want you to remember me.
i am leaving my fingerprints.
i am leaving my fingerprints.
do not give up.
do not give in.
build your house on the rock.
oh not in the sand, in the sand, in the sand.

its my life and i am not sitting on the sidelines watching.
it pass me by.
i am leaving you my legacy.
i gotta make my mark.
i gotta run it hard.
i want you to remember me.
i want you to remember me.
its my life and i am not sitting on the sidelines watching.
it pass me by.
i am leaving you my legacy.
i gotta make my mark.
i gotta run it hard.
i want you to remember me.
cause i am leaving my fingerprints.
i am leaving my fingerprints.
i am leaving my fingerprints, in the end.
