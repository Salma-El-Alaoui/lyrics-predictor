the way she came into the place.
i knew right then and there.
there was something different.
about this girl.

the way she moved.
her hair, her face, her lines.
divinity in motion.

as she stalked the room.
i could feel the aura.
of her presence.
every head turned.
feeling passion and lust.

the girl was persuasive.
the girl i could not trust.
the girl was bad.
the girl was dangerous.

i never knew but i was.
walking the line.
come go with me.
i said i have no time.
and do not you pretend we did not.
talk on the phone.
my baby cried.
she left me standing alone.

shes so dangerous.
the girl is so dangerous.
take away my money.
throw away my time.
you can call me honey.
but you are no damn good for me.

she came at me in sections.
with the eyes of desire.
i fell trapped into her.
web of sin.
a touch, a kiss.
a whisper of love.
i was at the point.
of no return.

deep in the darkness of.
passions insanity.
i felt taken by lusts.
strange inhumanity.
this girl was persuasive.
this girl i could not trust.
the girl was bad.
the girl was dangerous.

i never knew.
but i was living in vain.
she called my house.
she said you know my name.
and do not you pretend.
you never did me before.
with tears in her eyes.
my baby walked out the door.

shes so dangerous.
the girl is so dangerous.
take away my money.
throw away my time.
you can call me honey.
but you are no damn good for me.

dangerous.
the girl is so dangerous.
i have to pray to god.
cause i know how.
lust can blind.
its a passion in my soul.
but you are no damn lover.
friend of mine.

i can not sleep alone tonight.
my baby left me here tonight.
i cannot cope til its all right.
you and your manipulation.
you hurt my baby.

and then it happened.
she touched me.
for the lips of.
a strange woman.
drop as a honeycomb.
and her mouth was.
smoother than oil.
but her inner spirit and words.
were as sharp as.
a two edged sword.
but i loved it.
cause its dangerous.

dangerous.
the girl is so dangerous.
take away my money.
throw away my time.
you can call me honey.
but you are no damn good for me.
