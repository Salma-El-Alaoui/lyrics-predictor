ooh you are a holiday , such a holiday.
ooh you are a holiday , such a holiday.

its something i thinks worthwhile.
if the puppet makes you smile.
if not then you are throwing stones.
throwing stones, throwing stones.

ooh its a funny game.
do not believe that its all the same.
ca not think what i have just said.
put the soft pillow on my head.

millions of eyes can see.
yet why am i so blind.
when the someone else is me.
its unkind, its unkind.

de de de de de de de de de de de de de.

yet millions of eyes can see.
yet why am i so blind.
when the someone else is me.
its unkind, its unkind.

ooh you are a holiday , evry day , such a holiday.
now its my turn to say , and i say you are a holiday.
its something i thinks worthwhile.
if the puppet makes you smile.
if not then you are throwing stones.
throwing stones , throwing stones.
