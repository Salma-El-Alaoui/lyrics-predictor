run your hands through your hair.
absentmindedly making me want you.

i wanna stay right here in this passengers seat.
you put your eyes on me.

you take my hand and drag me head first.
fearless.
and i do not know why, but with you id dance in a storm in my best dress.
fearless.

you pull me in and i am a little more brave.

and i do not know how it gets better than this.
you take my hand and drag me head first.
