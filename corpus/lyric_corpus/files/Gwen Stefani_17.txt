i have not thought of you for years, you know.
your memory seems to come and go.
our time meant so much to me.
now you can not be found.

you were the first to want me, the first to love me, the first to need me.
who was the last to know you? the last to love you? the last to hold you.

its a wonderful, wonderful life.
its a wonderful, wonderful life.
its a wonderful, wonderful life.
such a wonderful, wonderful life.

i thought of you again today.
reminded me how, with time, i have changed.
if you only knew what you gave to me.
now you can not be found.

and you were the first i trusted, i learned what love is when we were just kids.
when did you kiss the last time? how could you think youd be better off.

its a wonderful, wonderful life.
whyd you have to say goodbye.
its a wonderful, wonderful life.
such a wonderful, wonderful life.

thank you for those special moments.
you will always be here in my mind.
and did you know you changed my life.
i am thankful for that time.
i am thankful for that time.
i am thankful for that time.

its a wonderful, wonderful life.
whyd you have to say goodbye.
its a wonderful, wonderful life.
i am asking why but i will never know.

its a wonderful, wonderful life.
whyd you have to say goodbye.
its a wonderful, wonderful life.
such a wonderful, wonderful life.

its a wonderful, wonderful life.
such a wonderful, wonderful life.
