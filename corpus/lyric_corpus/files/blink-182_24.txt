hello there.
the angel from my nightmare.
the shadow in the background of the morgue.
the unsuspecting victim.
of darkness in the valley.
we can live like jack and sally.
if we want.
where you can always find me.
and we will have halloween on christmas.
and in the night we will wish this never ends.
we will wish this never ends.

i miss you.
i miss you.

where are you?
and i am so sorry.
i cannot sleep.
i cannot dream tonight.
i need somebody and always.
this sick, strange darkness.
comes creeping on so haunting every time.
and as i stared i counted.
the webs from all the spiders.
catching things and eating their insides.
like indecision to call you.
and hear your voice of treason.
will you come home.
and stop this pain tonight?
stop this pain tonight.

do not waste your time on me.
you are already the voice inside my head.
i miss you, miss you.
do not waste your time on me.
you are already the voice inside my head.
i miss you, miss you.

do not waste your time on me.
you are already the voice inside my head.
i miss you, miss you.
do not waste your time on me.
you are already the voice inside my head.
i miss you, miss you.

do not waste your time on me.
you are already the voice inside my head.
i miss you, miss you.
do not waste your time on me.
you are already the voice inside my head.
i miss you, miss you.

i miss you, miss you.
i miss you, miss you.
i miss you, miss you.
i miss you, miss you.
