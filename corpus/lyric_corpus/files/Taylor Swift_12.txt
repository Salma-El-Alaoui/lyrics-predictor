you are on the phone with your girlfriend.
shes upset.
shes going off about something that you said.
she does not get your humor like i do.
i am in the room.
its a typical tuesday night.
i am listening to the kind of music she does not like.
and she will never know your story like i do.

but she wears short skirts.
i wear t shirts.
shes cheer captain.
and i am on the bleachers.
dreaming about the day when you wake up and find.
that what you are looking for has been here the whole time.

if you could see that i am the one who understands you.
been here all along so why can not you see.
you belong with me.
you belong with me.

walking the streets with you and your worn out jeans.
i can not help thinking this is how it ought to be.
laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself.
hey is not this easy.

and you have got a smile that could light up this whole town.
i have not seen it in a while since she brought you down.
you say your fine.
i know you better then that.
hey whatcha doing with a girl like that.

she wears high heels.
i wear sneakers.
shes cheer captain.
and i am on the bleachers.
dreaming about the day when you wake up.
that what you are looking for has been here the whole time.

if you could see that i am the one who understands you.
been here all along so why can not you see.
you belong with me.

standing by and waiting at your back door.
all this time how could you not know.
baby.
you belong with me.
you belong with me.

oh.
i remember you driving to my house in the middle of the night.
i am the one who makes you laugh.
when you know your about to cry.
and i know your favorite songs.
and you tell me about your dreams.
think i know where you belong.
think i know its with me.

ca not you see that i am the one who understands you.
been here all along.
so why can not you see.
you belong with me.

standing by and waiting at your back door.
all this time.
how could you not know.
baby you belong with me.
you belong with me.

have you ever thought just maybe.
you belong with me.

you belong with me.
