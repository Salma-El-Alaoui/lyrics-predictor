i used to think.
i had the answers to everything.
but now i know.
that life does not always go my way, yeah.

feels like i am caught in the middle.
thats when i realize.

i am not a girl, not yet a woman.
all i need is time.
a moment that is mine.
while i am in between.
i am not a girl.

there is no need to protect me.
its time that i.
learn to face up to this on my own, oh.

i have seen so much more than you know now.
so do not tell me to shut my eyes.

i am not a girl, not yet a woman.
all i need is time.
a moment that is mine.
while i am in between.
i am not a girl.

but if you look at me closely.
you will see it in my eyes.
this girl will always find her way.

i am not a girl i am not a girl, do not tell me what to believe.
not yet a woman i am just trying to find the woman in me, yeah.
all i need is time oh, all i need is time.
thats mine, while i am in between.

i am not a girl, not yet a woman.
all i need is time.
a moment that is mine.
while i am in between.

i am not a girl, ooh.
not yet a woman.
