bell door on clanks, come on in.
floyd observes my hairy chin.
sit down chair do not be afraid.
steamed hot towel on my face.

i was shaved.
i was shaved.
i was shaved.

barney ties me to the chair.
i can not see i am really scared.
floyd breathes hard i hear a zip.
pee pee pressed against my lips.

i was shamed.
i was shamed.
i was shamed.

i sense others in the room.
opey, aunt bea, i presume.
they take turns and cut me up.
i died smothered in andys clutch.

i was shaved.
i was shaved.
i was shaved.
