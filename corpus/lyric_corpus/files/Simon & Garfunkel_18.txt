through the corridors of sleep.
past shadows dark and deep.
my mind dances and leaps in confusion.
i do not know what is real.
i can not touch what i feel.
and i hide behind the shield of my illusion.

chorus.
so i will continue to continue to pretend.
my life will never end.
and flowers never bend.
with the rainfall.

the mirror on my wall.
cast an image dark and small.
but i am not sure at all its my reflection.
i am blinded by the light.
of god, and truth and right.
and i wander in the night without direction.

chorus.

its no matter if you are born.
to play the king or pawn.
for the line is thinly drawn tween joy and sorrow.
so my fantasy.
becomes reality.
and i must be, what i must be, and face tomorrow.

chorus.
