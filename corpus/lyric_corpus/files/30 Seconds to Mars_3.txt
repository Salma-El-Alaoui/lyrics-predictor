did we create a modern myth?
did we imagine half of it.
would happen in a thought from now?
save yourself, save yourself.

the secret is out.
the secret is out.

to buy the truth and sell a lie.
the last mistake before you die.
so do not forget to breathe tonight.
tonights the last to say goodbye.

the secret is out.
the secret is out.
the secret is out.
the secret is out.

goodbye, goodbye.
goodbye, goodbye.
goodbye, goodbye.
goodbye, goodbye.
goodbye, goodbye.
goodbye, goodbye.
goodbye, goodbye.
goodbye, goodbye.
goodbye.
