on and on, reckless abandon.
somethings wrong.
this is gonna shock them.
nothing to hold on to.
we will use this song.
to lead you on.

i learned a lot today.
not sure if i will get laid and.
not sure if i will fail or pass.
kissed every girl in class.

everybody would waste it all.
to have a summer that they could call.
a memory thats full of fun.
fucked up when its all done.

on and on, reckless abandon.
somethings wrong.
this is gonna shock them.
nothing to hold on to.
we will use this song.
to lead you on.
and break the truth with more bad news.
we left a scar size extra large.

sip a drink of the alcohol.
end up kneeling in bathroom stalls.
eyes are red and my movements slow.
too high, got vertigo.

he took a shit in the bathroom tub.
and fed the dog the brownie drugs.
tried hard to not get caught.
he fucked a chick in a parking lot.

on and on, reckless abandon.
somethings wrong.
this is gonna shock them.
nothing to hold on to.
we will use this song.
to lead you on.
and break the truth with more bad news.
we left a scar size extra large.

break a window and bust a wall.
making fun of your friends mom.
turn the music up way too loud.
charge the pizza to the house.

everybody would waste it all.

to have a summer that they could call.
memory thats full of fun.
fucked up when its all done.

on and on, reckless abandon.
somethings wrong.
this is gonna shock them.
nothing to hold on to.
we will use this song.
to lead you on.
and break the truth with more bad news.
we left a scar size extra large.
