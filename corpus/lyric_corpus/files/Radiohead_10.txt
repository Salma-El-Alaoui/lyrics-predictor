when you were here before.
could not look you in the eye.
you are just like an angel.
your skin makes me cry.

you float like a feather.
in a beautiful world.
i wish i was special.
you are so fucking special.

but i am a creep.
i am a weirdo.
what the hell am i doing here?
i do not belong here.

i do not care if it hurts.
i wanna have control.
i want a perfect body.
i want a perfect soul.

i want you to notice.
when i am not around.
you are so fucking special.
i wish i was special.

but i am a creep.
i am a weirdo.
what the hell am i doing here?
i do not belong here, ohhhh, ohhhh.

shes running out the door.
shes running out.
she runs, runs, runs, runs.
runs.

whatever makes you happy.
whatever you want.
you are so fucking special.
i wish i was special.

but i am a creep.
i am a weirdo.
what the hell am i doing here?
i do not belong here.

i do not belong here.
