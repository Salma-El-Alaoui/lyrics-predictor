killer cars ... cars.
killer cars.

too hard on the brakes again.
what if these brakes just give in?
what if they do not get outta the way?
what if theres someone overtaking?

i am going out for a little drive, and it could be the last time you see me alive.
there could be an idiot on the road.
the only kick in life is pumping that steel.

wrap me up in the back of the trunk, packed with foam and blind drunk.
they will not ever take me alive.
cause they all drive ...

do not die on the motorway.
the moon would freeze, the plants would die.
i could not cope if you crashed today.
all the things i forgot to say.

what if that car loses control?
