   i am kasha i lives in uk and i was in a serious relationship with my ex guy for three good years.. one day we were in a dinner party, we had a little misunderstanding which lead to a quarrel and he stood up and left me at the dinner party. i try to call him but he was not picking my calls so after than i contacted my brother and told him about it,my brother so much love me that he had to see him on my behalf,he told my brother that it is over between us.. then i contacted a friend of mine that had this similar experience and she directed me to one of the spiritual diviner maduraitempleyahoo.com.at first i thought it was not going to be possible and i contacted him i was ask to come up with a little requirement,so i did what i was ask to do, after 3 days i was in my office when my ex guy called me and was asking me to forgive him and come back to him. i was very surprise it was like a dream to me,so ever since we have been happily married with one kid my lovely babyceslav...i wish you the best of luck....
