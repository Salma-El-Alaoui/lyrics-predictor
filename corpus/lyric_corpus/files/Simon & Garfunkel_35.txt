its a still life watercolor.
of a now late afternoon.
as the sun shines through the curtain lace.
and shadows wash the room.

and we sit and drink our coffee.
couched in our indifference.
like shells upon the shore.
you can hear the ocean roar.

in the dangling conversation.
and the superficial sighs.
the borders of our lives.

and you read your emily dickenson.
and i my robert frost.
and we note our place with bookmarkers.
that measure what we have lost.

like a poem poorly written.
we are persons out of rhythm.
couplets out of rhyme.
in syncopated time.

and the dangling conversation.
and the superficial sighs.
are the borders of our lives.

yes, we speak of things that matter.
with words that must be said.
can analysis be worthwhile.
is the theatre really dead.

and how the room is softly faded.
and i only kiss your shadow.
i cannot feel your hand.
you are a stranger now unto me.

lost in the dangling conversation.
and the superficial sighs.
in the borders of our lives.
