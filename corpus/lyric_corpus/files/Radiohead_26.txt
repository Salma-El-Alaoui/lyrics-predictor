faith, you are driving me away.
you do it everyday.
you do not mean it.
but it hurts like hell.

my brain says i am receiving pain.
a lack of oxygen.
from my life support.
my iron lung.

we are too young to fall asleep.
to cynical to speak.
we are losing it.
ca not you tell?

we scratch our eternal itch.
a twentieth century bitch.
and we are grateful for.
our iron lung.

the head shrinkers.
they want everything.
my uncle bill.
my belisha beacon.
the head shrinkers.
they want everything.
my uncle bill.
my belisha beacon.

suck, suck your teenage thumb.
toilet trained and dumb.
when the power runs out.
we will just hum.

this, this is our new song.
just like the last one.
a total waste of time.
my iron lung.

the head shrinkers.
they want everything.
my uncle bill.
my belisha beacon.
the head shrinkers.
they want everything.
my uncle bill.
my belisha beacon.

and if you are frightened.
you can be frightened.
you can be, its ok.
and if you are frightened.
you can be frightened.
you can be, its ok.

the head shrinkers.
they want everything.
my uncle bill.
my belisha beacon.
