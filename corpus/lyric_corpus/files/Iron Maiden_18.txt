ca not understand what is happening to me.
this is not real, this is only a dream.
but i never have felt, no i never have felt this way before.
i am looking down on my body below.
i lie asleep in the midst of a dream.
is it now could it be that the angel of death has come for me?
i can not believe that really my time has come.
i do not feel ready, theres so much left undone.
and its my soul and i am not gonna let it get away.

chorus.
heaven can wait.
heaven can wait.
heaven can wait.
heaven can wait til another day.

repeat chorus.

i have a lust for the earth below.
and hell itself is my only foe.
cause i have no fear of dying.
i will go when i am good and ready.
i snatch a glimpse of the lights eternal rays.
i see a tunnel, i stand amazed.
at all of the people standing there in front of me.
into the paths of rightness i will be led.
is this the place where the living join the dead?
i wish i knew this was only just a nightmare.

chorus 2.

take my hand, i will lead you to the promised land.
take my hand, i will give you immortality.
eternal youth, i will take you to the other side.
to see the truth, the path for you is decided.

oh oh  lots.

my body tingles, i feel so strange.
i feel so tired, i feel so drained.
and i am wondering if i will ever be the same again.
is this in limbo or in heaven or hell?
maybe i am going down there as well.
i can not accept my soul will drift forever.
i feel myself floating back down to earth.
so could this be the hour of my rebirth?
or have i died or will i wake from dreaming?

chorus.
