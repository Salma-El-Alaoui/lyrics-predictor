cut the skin to the bone.
fall asleep all alone.
hear your voice in the dark.
lose myself in your eyes.
choke my voice say goodnight.
as the world falls apart.
fuck i can not let this kill me, let go.
i need some more time to fix this.

heres a letter for you.
but the words get confused.
and the conversation dies.
apologize for the past.
talk some shit take it back.
are we cursed to this life.

fuck i can not let this kill me, let go.
i need some more time to fix this problem.
i need some more time to fix this problem.
i need some more time to fix this.

i am talking to the ceiling.
my life just lost all meaning.
do one thing for me tonight.
i am dying in this silence.

the last star left in heaven.
is falling down to earth and.
do you still feel the same way.
do you still feel the same way.

fuck i can not let this kill me, let go.
i need some more time to fix this problem.
i need some more time to fix this problem.
i need some more time to fix this.
