sky fits heaven so fly it.
thats what the prophet said to me.
child fits mother so hold your baby tight.
thats what my future could see.

fate fits karma so use it.
thats what the wise man said to me.
love fits virtue so hold on to the light.
thats what our future will be.

chorus.

traveling down this road.
watching the signs as i go.
i think i will follow the sun.
is not everyone just.
traveling down their own road.
watching the signs as they go.
i think i will follow my heart.
its a very good place to start.

traveling down my own road.
watching the signs as i go.
traveling down my own road.
and i am watching the signs as they go.

traveling, traveling.
watching the signs as i go.

hand fits giving so do it.
thats what the gospel said to me.
life fits living so let your judgments go.
thats how our future should be.

chorus.

traveling down my own road.
watching the signs as they go.
traveling down my own road.
and i am watching the signs as i go.

traveling, traveling.
watching the signs as i go.
