feel the sweat break on my brow.
is it me or is it shadows that are.
dancing on the walls.
is this a dream or is it now.
is this a vision or normality i see.
before my eyes.

i wonder why, i wonder how.
that it seems the powers getting stronger.
every day.
i feel a strength an inner fire.
but i am scared i will not be able to control it anymore.

theres a time to live and a time to die.
when its time to meet the maker.
theres a time to live but is not it strange.
that as soon as you are born you are dying.

just by looking through your eyes.
he could see the future penetrating right.
in through you mind.
see the truth and see your lies.
but for all his power could not foresee his own demise.

theres a time to live and a time to die.
when its time to meet the maker.
theres a time to live but is not it strange.
that as soon as you are born you are dying...
...and be reborn again?
