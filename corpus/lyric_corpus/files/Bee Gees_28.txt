ah...

i never fell in love so easily.
where the four winds blow i carry on.
id like to take you where my spirit flies.
through the empty skies.
we go alone.
never before.
having flown.

faster than lightening is this heart of mine.
in the face of time i carry on.
id like to take you where my rainbow ends.
be my lover friend.
we go alone.
never before.
having flown.

i am your hurricane.
your fire in the sun.
how long must i live.
in the air?

you are my paradise.
my angel on the run.
how long must i wait?
its the dawn of the feeling.
that starts from the moment you are there.

you will never know what you have done for me.
you broke all those rules i live upon.
id like to take you to my shangri la.
neither here or far.
away from home.
never before.
having flown.

i am your hurricane.
your fire in the sun.
