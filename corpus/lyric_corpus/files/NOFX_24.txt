look at me now. full on the run. i can not stop myself from crashing. breaking grass, bumming a yard. fixing stuff that was never broken. pulling out all the stops. i am gonna puck on the cops. i am telling the kids, punk rocks. i am gonna puke on cops. gimme a side of airplane noise or a half a glass of our resistance. add a dash of disobedient public nusant, richtor riot. pulling out all the stops. i am gonna puck on the cops. i am telling the kids, punk rocks. i am gonna puke on cops..
