into the abyss i will fall the eye of horus.
into the eyes of the night watching me go.
green is the cats eye that glows .
in this temple.
enter the risen osiris risen again.

tell me why i had to be a powerslave.
i do not wanna die, i am a god.
why can not i live on?
when the life giver dies.
all around is laid waste.
and in my last hour.
i am a slave to the power of death.

when i was living this lie fear was my game.
people would worship and fall .
drop to their knees.
so bring me the blood and red wine.
for the one to succeed me.
for he is a man and a god .
and he will die too.

tell me why i had to be a powerslave.
i do not wanna die, i am a god.
why can not i live on?
when the life giver dies.
all around is laid to waste.
and in my last hour.
i am a slave to the power of death.

now i am cold but a ghost lives in my veins.
silent the terror that reigned .
marbled in stone.
a shell of a man god preserved .
a thousand ages.
but open the gates of my hell .
i will strike from my grave.

tell me why i had to be a powerslave.
i do not wanna die, i am a god.
why can not i live on?
when the life giver dies.
all around is laid waste.
and in my last hour.
i am a slave to the power of death.
slave to the power of death...
slave to the power of death....
