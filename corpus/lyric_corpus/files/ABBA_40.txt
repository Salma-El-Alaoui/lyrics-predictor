heres to us one more toast and then we will pay the bill.
deep inside both of us can feel the autumn chill.
birds of passage, you and me.
we fly instinctively.
when the summers over and the dark clouds hide the sun.
neither you nor i am to blame when all is said and done.

in our lives we have walked some strange and lonely treks.
slightly worn but dignified and not too old for sex.
we are still striving for the sky.
no taste for humble pie.
thanks for all your generous love and thanks for all the fun.
neither you nor i am to blame when all is said and done.

its so strange when you are down and lying on the floor.
how you rise, shake your head, get up and ask for more.
clear headed and open eyed.
with nothing left untried.
standing calmly at the crossroads,no desire to run.
theres no hurry any more when all is said and done.

standing calmly at the crossroads,no desire to run.
theres no hurry any more when all is said and done.
