notice me, take my hand.
why are we strangers when.
our love is strong.
why carry on without me.

everytime i try to fly, i fall.
without my wings, i feel so small.
i guess i need you, baby.
and everytime i see you in my dreams.
i see your face, its haunting me.
i guess i need you, baby.

i make believe that you are here.
its the only way i see clear.
what have i done.
you seem to move on easy.

and everytime i try to fly, i fall.
without my wings, i feel so small.
i guess i need you, baby.
and everytime i see you in my dreams.
i see your face, you are haunting me.
i guess i need you, baby.

i may have made it rain.
please forgive me.
my weakness caused you pain.
and this songs my sorry.

at night i pray.
that soon your face will fade away.

and everytime i try to fly, i fall.
without my wings, i feel so small.
i guess i need you, baby.
and everytime i see you in my dreams.
i see your face, you are haunting me.
i guess i need you, baby.
