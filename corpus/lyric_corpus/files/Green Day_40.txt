well, i heard you crying loud.
all the way across town.
cause you have been searching for that someone.
and its me out on the prowl.
as you sit around feeling sorry for yourself.
well do not get lonely now.
and dry your whining eyes.
i am just roaming for the moment.
sleazing my backyard, so do not get.
so uptight you have been thinking about ditching me.

no time to search the world around.
cause you know where i will be found.
when i come around.

i heard it all before.
so do not knock down my door.
i am a loser and a user.
so i do not need no accuser.
to try and slag me down because i know you are right.
so go do what you like.
make sure you do it wise.
you may find out that your self doubt.
means nothing was ever there.
you can not go forcing something if its just not right.

no time to search the world around.
cause you know where i will be found.
when i come around.

no time to search the world around.
cause you know where i will be found.
when i come around.
when i come around.
when i come around.
when i come around.
