i love to look into your big brown eyes.
they talk to me and seem to hypnotize.
you say the things nobody dares to say.
and i am not about to let you fly away.

my lover with no jet lag.
staying up all night in my sleeping bag.
you got a heart beating rhythm from the subterrain.
i really love you little girl, i do not need to explain.

i love you cause your deuces are wild, girl.
like a double shot of loving so fine.
i been loving you since you was a child, girl.
cause you and me is two of a kind.

like deja vu i feel like i have been here.
or somewhere else but you have been always near.
its you thats in my dreams i am begging for.
but i woke up when someone slammed the door.

so hard i fell out of bed.
screaming mamas little baby loves shortening bread.
and the moral of the story, i can testify.
