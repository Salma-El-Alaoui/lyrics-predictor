when i look into your eyes.
i can see a love restrained.
but darling when i hold you.
do not you know i feel the same.

cause nothing lasts forever.
and we both know hearts can change.
and its hard to hold a candle.
in the cold november rain.

we have been through this such a long long time.
just trying to kill the pain.

but lovers always come and lovers always go.
an no ones really sure whos letting go today.
walking away.

if we could take the time.
to lay it on the line.
i could rest my head.
just knowing that you were mine.
all mine.
so if you want to love me.
then darling do not refrain.
or i will just end up walking.
in the cold november rain.

do you need some time...on your own.
do you need some time...all alone.
everybody needs some time...
on their own.
do not you know you need some time...all alone.

i know its hard to keep an open heart.
when even friends seem out to harm you.
but if you could heal a broken heart.
would not time be out to charm you.

sometimes i need some time...on my.
own.
sometimes i need some time...all alone.
everybody needs some time...
on their own.
do not you know you need some time...all alone.

and when your fears subside.
and shadows still remain.
i know that you can love me.
when theres no one left to blame.
so never mind the darkness.
we still can find a way.
cause nothing lasts forever.
even cold november rain.

do not ya think that you need somebody.
do not ya think that you need someone.
everybody needs somebody.
you are not the only one.
you are not the only one.
