oh let the sun beat down upon my face, stars to fill my dream.
i am a traveler of both time and space, to be where i have been.
to sit with elders of the gentle race, this world has seldom seen.
they talk of days for which they sit and wait and all will be revealed.

talk and song from tongues of lilting grace, whose sounds caress my ear.
but not a word i heard could i relate, the story was quite clear.
oh, oh.

oh, i been blind... mama, there aingt no denying.
i have been blind, aingt no denying, no denying.

all i see turns to brown, as the sun burns the ground.
and my eyes fill with sand, as i scan this wasted land.
trying to find, trying to find where i have been.

oh, pilot of the storm who leaves no trace, like thoughts inside a dream.
heed the path that led me to that place, yellow desert stream.
my shangri la beneath the summer moon, i will return again.
sure as the dust that floats high in june, when moving through kashmir.

oh, father of the four winds, fill my sails, across the sea of years.
with no provision but an open face, along the straits of fear.
ohh.

when i am on, when i am on my way, yeah.
when i see, when i see the way, you stay yeah.

ooh, yeah yeah, ooh, yeah yeah, when i am down...
ooh, yeah yeah, ooh, yeah yeah, well i am down, so down.
ooh, my baby, oooh, my baby, let me take you there.

let me take you there. let me take you there.
