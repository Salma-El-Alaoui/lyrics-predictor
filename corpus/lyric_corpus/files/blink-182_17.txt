get ready for action!
i gotta regret right now i am feeling this.
the air is so cold and low i am feeling this.
let me go in her room i am feeling this.
i wanna take off her clothes i am feeling this.
show me the way to bed i am feeling this.
show me the way you move i am feeling this.
fuck it is such a blur i am feeling this.
i love all the things you do i am feeling this.

chorus.
fate fell short this time.
your smile fades in the summer.
place your hand in mine.
i will leave when i wanna.

where do we go from here.
turn all the lights down now.
smiling from ear to ear i am feeling this.
our breathing has got too loud i am feeling this.
show me the bedroom floor i am feeling this.
show me the bathroom mirror i am feeling this.
we are taking this way too slow i am feeling this.
take me away from here i am feeling this.

chorus x2.

this place was never the same again.
after you came and went.
how can you say you meant anything different.
to anyone standing alone.
on the street with a cigarette.
on the first night we met.

look to the past.
and remember her smile.
and maybe tonight.
i can breathe for awhile.
i am not in the scene.
i think i am falling asleep.
but then all that it means is.
i will always be dreaming of you.

chorus x5.
during last two choruses in the background.
are we alone, do you feel it.
so lost and disillusioned.
