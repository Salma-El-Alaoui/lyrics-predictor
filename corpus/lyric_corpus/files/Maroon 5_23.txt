after school, walking home.
fresh dirt under my fingernails and.
i can smell hot asphalt.
cars screech to a halt to let me pass.

and i cannot remember.
what life was like through photographs.
and trying to recreate images life gives us from our past.
and sometimes its a sad song.
but i.

cannot forget, refuse to regret.
so glad i met you and.
take my breath away.
make everyday.
worth all of the pain that i have gone through.
and mama, i have been crying.
cause things aingt how they used to be.
she said, the battles almost won.
and we are only several miles from the sun.

and i am moving on, down my street.
i see people i will not ever meet.
i think of her, take a breath.
feel the beat in the rhythm of my steps.
and sometimes its a sad song.
but i.

cannot forget, refuse to regret.
so glad i met you and.
take my breath away.
make everyday.
worth all of the pain that i have gone through.
and mama, i have been crying.
cause things aingt how they used to be.
she said, the battles almost won.
and we are only several miles from the sun.

rhythm of the conversation.
the perfection of her creation.
the sex she slipped into my coffee.
the way she felt when she first saw me.
hate to love and love to hate her.
like a broken record player.
back and forth and here and gone.
and on and on and on and on!

i cannot forget, refuse to regret.
so glad i met you and.
take my breath away.
make everyday.
worth all of the pain that i have gone through.
and mama, i have been crying.
cause things aingt how they used to be.
she said, the battles almost won.
and we are only several miles.
