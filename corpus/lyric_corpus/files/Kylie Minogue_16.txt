in my imagination.
there is no complication.
i dream about you all the time.
in my mind a celebration.
the sweetest of sensation.
thinking you could be mine.

in my imagination.
there is no hesitation.
we walk together hand in hand.
i am dreaming.
you fell in love with me.
like i am in love with you.
but dreamings all i do.
if only theyd come true.

chorus i should be so lucky.
lucky lucky lucky.
i should be so lucky in love.
i should be so lucky.
lucky lucky lucky.
i should be so lucky in love.

its a crazy situation.
you always keep me waiting.
because its only make believe.
and i would come a running.
to give you all my loving.
if one day you would notice me.

my heart is close to breaking.
and i can not go on faking.
the fantasy that you will be mine.
i am dreaming.
that you are in love with me.
like i am in love with you.
but dreamings all i do.
if only theyd come true.

chorus.

i should be so lucky so lucky, so lucky.
i should be so lucky i, i, i, i.
i should be so lucky so lucky, so lucky.
i should be so lucky.
i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i.

in my imagination.
there is no hesitation.
we walk together hand in hand.
i am dreaming.
you fell in love with me.
like i am in love with you.
but dreamings all i do.
if only theyd come true.

chorus repeat  fade.
