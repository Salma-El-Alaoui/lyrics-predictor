everyone makes one mistake.
one more time for old times sake.
one more time before the feeling fades.
one less born of memories.
one more bruise you gave to me.
one more test just how much can i take?

you are not the one but you are the only one who could make me feel like this.
you are not the one but you are the only one who can make me feel like shit.

something never meant to be.
everything you meant to me.
wake me when this punishment is done.
those who try and get away.
from the one who gets away.
someones always someone elses one.

you are not the one but your the only one who could make me feel like this.
you are not the one but your the only one who can make me feel like shit.
x2.

until the end of time.
in another life.
til the day i die.
save it up for one more try.
save it for the last goodbye.
we go on.
and get off.
and get on.
and get off.

you are not the one but you are the only one who could make me feel like this.
you are not the one but you are the only one who can make me feel like shit.
