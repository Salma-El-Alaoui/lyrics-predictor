something in the way you love me will not let me be.
i do not want to be your prisoner so baby will not you set me free.
stop playing with my heart.
finish what you start.
when you make my love come down.
if you want me let me know.
baby let it show.
honey do not you fool around.

just try to understand, i have given all i can.
cause you got the best of me.

chorus.

borderline feels like i am going to lose my mind.
you just keep on pushing my love over the borderline.

repeat chorus again.

keep on pushing me baby.
do not you know you drive me crazy.
you just keep on pushing my love over the borderline.

something in your eyes is making such a fool of me.
when you hold me in your arms you love me till i just can not see.
but then you let me down, when i look around, baby you just can not be found.
stop driving me away, i just wanna stay.
theres something i just got to say.

just try to understand, i have given all i can.
cause you got the best of me.

chorus.

keep on pushing me baby.
do not you know you drive me crazy.
you just keep on pushing my love over the borderline.

look what your love has done to me.
come on baby set me free.
you just keep on pushing my love over the borderline.
you cause me so much pain, i think i am going insane.
what does it take to make you see?
you just keep on pushing my love over the borderline.
