here i lie in a lost and lonely part of town.
held in time in a world of tears i slowly drown.
going home i just can not make it all alone.
i really should be holding you, holding you.
loving you, loving you.

tragedy when the feelings gone and you can not go on.
its tragedy. when the morning cries and you do not know why.
its hard to bear. with no one to love you, you are going nowhere.
tragedy when you lose control and you got no soul.
its tragedy. when the morning cries and you do not know why.
its hard to bear.
with no one beside you, you are going nowhere.

bridge.

night and day theres a burning down inside of me.
oh, burning love with a yearning that will not let me be.
down i go and i just can not take it all alone.
i really should be holding you, holding you.
loving you, loving you.
