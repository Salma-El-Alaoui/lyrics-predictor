someday, somewhere.
we will find a new way of living.
will find a way of forgiving.
somewhere...
theres a place for us.
somewhere a place for us.
peace and quiet and open air.
wait for us.
somewhere.
theres a time for us.
someday there will be a time for us.
time together and time to spare.
time to learn, time to care.
someday, somewhere.
we will find a new way of living.
will find theres a way of forgiving.
somewhere... somewhere... somewhere...
theres a place for us.
a time and a place for us.
hold my hand and we are half way there.
just hold my hand and i will take you there.
somehow...
someday, somewhere....
