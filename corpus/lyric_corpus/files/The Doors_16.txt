well the clock says its time to close now.
i guess id better go now.
id really like to stay here all night.
the cars crawl past all stuffed with eyes.
street lights share their hollow glow.
your brain seems bruised with numb surprise.
still one place to go.
still one place to go.

let me sleep all night.
in your soul kitchen.
warm my mind near your gentle stove.
turn me out and i will wander baby.
stumbling in the neon groves.

well your fingers weave quick minuets.
speak in secret alphabets.
i light another cigarette.
learn to forget.
learn to forget.
learn to forget.
learn to forget.

let me sleep all night.
in your soul kitchen.
warm my mind near your gentle stove.
turn me out and i will wander baby.
stumbling in the neon groves.

well the clock says its time to close now.
i know i will have to go now.
i really wanna stay here all night.
all night.
all night.
