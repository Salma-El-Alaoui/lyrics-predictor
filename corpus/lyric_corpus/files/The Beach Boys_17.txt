it starts with just a little glance now.
right away you are thinking bout romance now.
you know you ought to take it slower.
but you just can not wait to get to know her.

a brand new love affair is such a beautiful thing.
but if you are not careful think about the pain it can bring.

it makes you feel so bad.
it makes your heart feel sad.
it makes your days go wrong.
it makes your nights so long.

you have got to keep in mind love is here today.
and its gone tomorrow.
its here and gone so fast.

right now you think that shes perfection.
this time is really an exception.
well you know i hate to be a downer.
but i am the guy she left before you found her.

well i am not saying you will not have a good love with her.
but i keep on remembering things like they were.

she made me feel so bad.
she made my heart feel sad.
she made my days go wrong.
and made my nights so long.

you have got to keep in mind love is here today.
and its gone tomorrow.
its here and gone so fast.

keep in mind love is here today.
and its gone tomorrow.
its here and gone so fast.

love is here today.
and its gone tomorrow.
its here and gone so fast.
