can you hear the drums fernando.
i remember long ago another starry night like this.
in the firelight fernando.
you were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar.
i could hear the distant drums.
and sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar.

they were closer now fernando.
every hour every minute seemed to last eternally.
i was so afraid fernando.
we were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die.
and i am not ashamed to say the roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry.

there was something in the air that night.
the stars were bright.
fernando.
they were shining there for you and me.
for liberty.
fernando.

though we never thought that we could lose.
theres no regret.
if i had to do the same again.
i would my friend.
fernando.

if i had to do the same again.
i would my friend.
fernando.

now we are old and grey fernando.
since many years i have not seen a rifle in your hand.
can you hear the drums fernando.
do you still recall the fateful night we crossed the rio grande.
i could see it in your eyes how proud you were to fight for freedom in this land.

there was something in the air that night.
the stars were bright.
fernando.
they were shining there for you and me.
for liberty.
fernando.

though we never thought that we could lose.
theres no regret.

if i had to do the same again.
i would my friend.
fernando.

yes, if i had to do the same again.
i would my friend.
fernando....
