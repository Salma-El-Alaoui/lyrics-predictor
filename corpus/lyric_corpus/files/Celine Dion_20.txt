there was a boy...
a very strange enchanted boy.
they say he wandered very far, very far.
over land and sea.
a little shy and sad of eye.
but very wise was he.

and then one day.
one magic day, he passed my way.
and while we spoke of many things.
fools and kings.
this he said to me.
the greatest thing you will ever learn.
is just to love and be loved in return.
