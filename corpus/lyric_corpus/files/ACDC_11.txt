getting ready to rock, getting ready to roll.
gonna turn up the heat, gonna fire up the coal.
i gotta that motor turning.
i gotta keep that engine clean.
i gotta keep those tyres burning.
i have got the best you have ever seen.

cos i am a heatseeker, charging up the sky.
heatseeker, and i, do not need no life preserver.
do not need no one to hose me down.
to hose me down.

getting ready to break, get ready to go.
get your shoes off an shake, get your head down and blow.
ya gotta keep that woman firing.
you gotta keep that circuit clean.
you gotta make her sound the siren.
you gotta hear that lady scream.

cos i am a heatseeker, burning up the town.
heatseeker, i do not, i do not need no life preserver.
do not need no one to hose me down.
to hose me down, here it comes.

i am a heatseeker.
i am gonna measure you, gonna try you for size.
i am a heatseeker.

ya gotta keep that motor turning.
ya gotta keep that engine clean.
ya gotta keep those tyres burning.
i got the best you have ever seen.
i am a heatseeker.
i do not need no life preserver.
do not need no one to hose me down.

i am a heatseeker, i am a heatseeker, heatseeker.

out on the street feel the heat.
