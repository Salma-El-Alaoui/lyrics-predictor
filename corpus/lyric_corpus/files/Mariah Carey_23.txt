sorry i never told you.
all i wanted to say.
and now its too late to hold you.
cause you have flown away.
so far away.

never had i imagined.
living without your smile.
feeling and knowing you hear me.
it keeps me alive.
alive.

and i know you are shining down on me from heaven.
like so many friends we have lost along the way.
and i know eventually we will be togetherone sweet day.

darling, i never showed you.
assumed youd always be there.
i took your presence for granted.
but i always cared.
and i miss the love we shared.

and i know you are shining down on me from heaven.
like so many friends we have lost along the way.
and i know eventually we will be together.
one sweet day.

although the sun will never shine the same.
i will always look to a brighter day.
lord i know when i lay me down to sleep.
you will always listen as i pray.

and i know you are shining down on me from heaven.
like so many friends we have lost along the way.
and i know eventually we will be together.
one sweet day.

and i know you are shining down on me from heaven.
