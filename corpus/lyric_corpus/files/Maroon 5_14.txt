ooh.

danced all night, slept all day.
careless with my heart again.
fearless when it comes to playing games.

you do not cry, you do not care.
afraid to have a love affair.
is that your ghost or are you really there?

now i can not walk, i can not talk anymore.
since you walked out the door.
and now i am stuck living out that night again.
i am not falling apart.

ooh, oh.

weather on a sunny day.
time slows down i wish youd stay.
pass me by in crowded, dark hallways.
mmm.

try my hardest not to scream.
i find my heart is growing weak.
so leave your reasons on the bathroom sink.

now i can not walk, i can not talk anymore.
since you walked out the door.
and now i am stuck living out that night again.
i am not falling apart.

i heard you say you needed me now.
whats the problem i can not see.
you destroyed me, i will not fall apart again.
i am not falling apart.

take what you want.
i will be just fine.
you will be better off alone at night.
waiting and falling.
constantly calling out your name.
will it ever change?

now i can not walk, i can not talk anymore.
since you walked out the door.
and now i am stuck living out that night again.
i am not falling apart.

i heard you say you needed me now.
whats the problem i can not see.
you destroyed me, i will not fall apart again.
i am not falling apart.

ohh, ooh.
