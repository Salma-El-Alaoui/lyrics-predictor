hes a stranger to some.
and a vision to none.
he can never get enough.
get enough of the world.
for a fortune hed quit.
but its hard to admit.
how it ends and begins.
on his face is a map of the world.
a map of the world.
on his face is a map of the world.
a map of the world.

from yesterday, its coming.
from yesterday, the fear.
from yesterday, it calls him.
but he does not want to read the message here.

on a mountain he sits.
not of gold but of shit.
through the blood he can look.
see the life that it took.
from the council of one.
he will decide when hes done.
with the innocent.
on his face is a map of the world.
a map of the world.
on his face is a map of the world.
a map of the world.

from yesterday, its coming.
from yesterday, the fear.
from yesterday, it calls him.
but he does not want to read the message.
he does not want to read the message.
does not want to read the message here.

on his face is a map of the world.

from yesterday, its coming.
from yesterday, the fear.
from yesterday, it calls him.
but he does not want to read the message here.
from yesterday.
from yesterday.
from yesterday, the fear.
from yesterday.
from yesterday.
but he does not want to read the message here.
but he does not want to read the message here.
but he does not want to read the message here.
