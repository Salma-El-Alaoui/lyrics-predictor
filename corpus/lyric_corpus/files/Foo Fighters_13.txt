burn all the candles out.
make a wish but not aloud.
relive the here and now.
see you now and then.
i am a revolving door.
i have seen it all before.
i will begin again.
but i can not start until i have seen the end.

i took a look around.
i believe in hand me down.
the treasures all we have found.
when we were brand new.
now that we are old and worn.
a little ripped and torn.
one day we will be reborn.
one day i will meet you right back here.
once again.
wait.
stop me so i can begin.

end over end x3.
i am circling.
end over end x3.
i am circling.

i am feeling out of luck.
maybe i just feel too much.
that old familiar touch.
always stained my skin.
the good in everyone.
the ties we left undone.
the heart that moves your blood.
all the things that bring me right back here.
once again.
wait.
stop me so i can begin.

end over end x3.
i am circling.
end over end x3.
i am circling.
end over end x3.
i am circling.
end over end x3.
i am circling, im circling.
hey.
once again.
wait.
stop me so i can begin.

end over end x3.
i am circling.
end over end x3.
i am circling.
end over end x3.
i am circling.
end over end x3.
i am circling, i am circling.
i am circling, i am circling.
i am circling.
