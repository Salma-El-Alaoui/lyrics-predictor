they say a restless body can hide a peaceful soul.
a voyager, ad a settler, they both have a distant goal.
if i explore the heavens, or if i search inside.
well, it really does not matter as long as i can tell myself.
i have always tried.

like a roller in the ocean.
life is motion.
move on.
like a wind thats always blowing.
life is flowing.
move on.

like the sunrise in the morning.
life is dawning.
move on.
how i treasure every minute.
being part of it, being in it.
with the urge to move on.

i have travelled every country.
i have travelled in my mind.
it seems we are on a journey.
a trip through space and time.
and somewhere lies the answer.
to all the questions why.
what really makes the difference.
between all dead and living things.
the will to stay alive.

with the urge to move on.

the morning breeze that ripples the surface of the sea.
the crying of the seagulls that hover over me.
i see it and i hear it.
but how can i explain.
the wonder of the moment.
to be alive, to feel the sun that follows every rain.

like a roller in the ocean la la la la la la la.
life is motion la la la la la la la.
