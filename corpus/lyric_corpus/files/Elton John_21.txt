hey nikita is it cold.
in your little corner of the world.
you could roll around the globe.
and never find a warmer soul to know.

oh i saw you by the wall.
ten of your tin soldiers in a row.
with eyes that looked like ice on fire.
the human heart a captive in the snow.

chorus.
oh nikita you will never know, anything about my home.
i will never know how good it feels to hold you.
nikita i need you so.
oh nikita is the other side of any given line in time.
counting ten tin soldiers in a row.
oh no, nikita you will never know.

do you ever dream of me.
do you ever see the letters that i write.
when you look up through the wire.
nikita do you count the stars at night.

and if there comes a time.
guns and gates no longer hold you in.
and if you are free to make a choice.
just look towards the west and find a friend.

chorus.
oh nikita you will never know, anything about my home.
i will never know how good it feels to hold you.
oh no, nikita youl never know.

repeat chorus.
