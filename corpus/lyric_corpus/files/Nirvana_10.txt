one baby to another says  .
i am lucky to have met you.
i do not care what you think.
unless it is about me.
it is now my duty to completely drain you.
i travel through a tube.
and end up in your infection.

chew your meat for you.
pass it back and forth.
in a passionate kiss.
from my mouth to yours.
i like you.

with eyes so dilated.
i have become your pupil.
you have taught me everything.
without a poison apple.
the water is so yellow, i am a healthy student.
indebted and so grateful  .
vacuum out the fluids.

chew your meat for you.
pass it back and forth.
in a passionate kiss.
from my mouth to yours.
i like you.

sloppy lips to lips.
you are my vitamins.
i like you.
