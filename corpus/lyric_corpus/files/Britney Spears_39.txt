they say.
i am away.
because i am down with you everyday.
they say.
break away.
i am missing out on the fun and games.

but you smile.
and the words they tell me.
quickly disappear.
you speak and there is no other.
voice that i can hear.

chorus.
i spend my days oh, oh all day all night.
with you.
i spend my nights my nights.
thinking about you 2x.

you stepped on.
on my mind.
and i think about you.
all the time.
day and night.
feels so right.
and for us there is no end in sight.

each day that i spend around you.
passes by too fast.
each night.
that i spend without you.
is longer than the last.

chorus.
