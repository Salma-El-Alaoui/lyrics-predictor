blues hearted lady sleepy was she.
love for the devil brought her to me.
seas of a thousand drawn to her sin.
seasons of wither holdin me in.

ooh woe is me i feel so badly for you.
ooh woe is me i feel so sadly for you.
in time bound to lose your mind.
live on borrowed time.
take the wind right out of your sail.

fireflies dance in the heat of.
hound dogs that bay at the moon.
my ship leaves in the midnight.
ca not say i will be back too soon.

they awaken far far away.
heat of my candle shows me the way.
seas of a thousand drawn to her sin.
seasons of wither holdin me in.

ooh woe is me i feel so badly for you.
ooh woe is me i feel so sadly for you.
in time bound to lose your mind.
live on borrowed time.
take the wind right out of your sail.
