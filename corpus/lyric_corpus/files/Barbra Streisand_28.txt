when you just give love.
and never get love.
youd better let love depart.
i know its so.
and yet i know.
i can not get you out of my heart.
you may leave my happy home.
you took my love and now you are gone.
since i fell for you.
love brings such misery and pain.
i guess it will never be the same.
since i fell for you.
well, its too bad.


and its too sad.
but i am in love with you.
you love me.
you love me then you snub me.
but what can i do?
i am still.
i am still.
i am still in love with you.
i guess i will never see the light.
i get the blues most every night.
since i fell for you.
since i fell for you....
