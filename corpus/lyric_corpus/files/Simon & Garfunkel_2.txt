time, time, time.
see whats become of me.
while i looked around.
for my possibilities.
i was so hard to please.

but look around.
leaves are brown.
and the sky.
is a hazy shade of winter.

hear the salvation army band.
down by the riverside.
its bound to be a better ride.
than what you have got planned.
carry your cup in your hand.

and look around you.
leaves are brown now.
and the sky.
is a hazy shade of winter.

hang on to your hopes, my friend.
thats an easy thing to say.
but if your hopes should pass away.
simply pretend.
that you can build them again.

look around.
grass is high.
the fields are ripe.
its the springtime of my life.

ah, seasons change with the scenery.
weaving time in a tapestry.
will not you stop and remember me.
at any convenient time.
funny how my memory skips.
while looking over manuscripts.
of unpublished rhyme.
drinking my vodka and lime.

i look around.
leaves are brown now.
and the sky.
is a hazy shade of winter.

look around.
leaves are brown.
theres a patch of snow on the ground.
look around.
leaves are brown.
theres a patch of snow on the ground.
look around.
leaves are brown.
theres a patch of snow on the ground.
