telling me to go.
but hands beg me to stay.
your lips say that you love.
your eyes say that you hate.

theres truth in your lies.
doubt in your faith.
what you build you lay to waste.
theres truth in your lies.
doubt in your faith.
all i have gots what you did not take.

so i, i will not be the one.
be the one to leave this.
in pieces.
and you, you will be alone.
alone with all your secrets.
and regrets.

do not lie.

you promise me the sky.
then toss me like a stone.
you wrap me in your arms.
and chill me to the bone.

theres truth in your lies.
doubt in your faith.
all i have gots what you did not take.

so i, i will not be the one.
be the one to leave this.
in pieces.
and you, you will be alone.
alone with all your secrets.
and regrets.

do not lie.

so i, i will not be the one.
be the one to leave this.
in pieces.
and you, you will be alone.
alone with all your secrets.
and regrets.

do not lie.
