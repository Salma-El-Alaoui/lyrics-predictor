i am waiting in my cold cell, when the bell begins to chime.
reflecting on my past life and it does not have much time.
cause at 5 oclock, they take me to the gallows pole.
the sands of time for me are running low.

when the priest comes to read me the last rites.
i take a look through the bars at the last sights.
of a world that has gone very wrong for me.

can it be that theres some sort of error.
hard to stop the surmounting terror.
is it really the end, not some crazy dream?

somebody please tell me that i am dreaming.
its not easy to stop from screaming.
but words escape me when i try to speak.
tears fall but why am i crying.
after all i am not afraid of dying.
do not believe that there never is an end.

as the guards march me out to the courtyard.
somebody cries from a cell god be with you.
if theres a god then why has he let me go?

as i walk my life drifts before me.
though the end is near i am not sorry.
catch my soul, its willing to fly away.

mark my words believe my soul lives on.
do not worry now that i have gone.
i have gone beyond to see the truth.

when you know that your time is close at hand.
maybe then you will begin to understand.
life down here is just a strange illusion.

hallowed be thy name.
