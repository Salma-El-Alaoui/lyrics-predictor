you might think i am crazy but i am serious.

its better you know now.

what i thought was happiness.

was only part time bliss.

you can take a bow.



it was all just one big night out on the town.

riding in your limousine.

we turned right, then i said wrong.

which brings us to a stop.

as the light is changing.

oh my meters running so i got to go, now.



chorus.

its the pleasure principle, oh oh oh oh oh oh.

its the principle of pleasure, oh oh.

its the pleasure principle, oh oh oh oh oh oh.



its true you want to build your life on guarantees.

hey take a ride in a big yellow taxi.

i am not here to feed your insecurities.

i wanted you to love me.

this has become an all too familiar scene.

its not the first time i have paid the fare.

whered you get the idea of material possession?

thank you for the ride nowhere.

and oh my meters running, so i really have to go.

you might say that i am no good.

i would not trust your looks, baby if i could.

i got too many things i wanna do before i am through.

its the pleasure principle, its the pleasure principle.

after all the love that we have been through.

after all you put me through, love me, love me.
