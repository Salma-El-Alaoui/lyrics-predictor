here we stand or here we fall.
history will not care at all.
make the bed, light the light.
lady mercy will not be home tonight.

you do not waste no time at all.
do not hear the bell but you answer the call.
it comes to you as to us all.
we are just waiting.
for the hammer to fall.

oh evry night and every day.
a little piece of you is falling away.
but lift your face the western way.
build your muscles as your body decays.

toe your line and play their game.
let the anaesthetic cover it all.
till one day they call your name.
you know its time for the hammer to fall.

rich or poor or famous.
for your truth its all the same oh no, oh no.
lock your door the rain is pouring.
through your window pane oh no.
baby now your struggles all in vain.

for we who grew up tall and proud.
in the shadow of the mushroom cloud.
convinced our voices can not be heard.
we just wanna scream it louder and louder and louder.

what the hell we fighting for?
just surrender and it will not hurt at all.
just got time to say your prayers.
while you are waiting for the hammer to hammer to fall.

its gonna fall.
hammer.
you know.
hammer to fall.
while you are waiting for the hammer to fall.

give it to me one more time.
