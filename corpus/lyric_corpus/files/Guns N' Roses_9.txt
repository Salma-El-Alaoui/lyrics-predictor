hey you caught me in a coma.
and i do not think i wanna.
ever come back to this... world again.
kinda like it in a coma.
cause no ones ever gonna.
oh, make me come back to this... world again.
now i feel as if i am floating away.
i can not feel all the pressure.
and i like it this way.
but my bodys calling.
my bodys calling.
will not ya come back to this... world again.
suspended deep in a sea of black.
i have got the light at the end.
i have got the bones on the mast.
well i have gone sailing.
i have gone sailing.
i could leave so easily.
while friends are calling back to me.
i said they are.
they are leaving it all up to me.
when all i needed was clarity.
and someone to tell me.
what the fuck is going on.
goddamn it !

slipping farther an farther away.
its a miracle how long we can stay.
in a world our minds created.
in a world thats full of shit.

help me.
help me.
help me.
help me.
bastard.

please understand me.
i am climbing through the wreackage.
of all my twisted dreams.
but this cheap investigation just.
ca not stifle all my screams.
and i am waiting at the crossroads.
waiting for you.
waiting for you.
where are you.

no ones gonna bother me anymore.
no ones gonna mess with my head no more.
i can not understand what all the fightings for.
but its so nice here down off the shore.
i wish you could see this.
cause theres nothing to see.
its peaceful here and its fine with me.
not like the world where i used to live.
i never really wanted to live.

zap him again.
zap the son of a bitch again.

ya live your life like its a coma.
so will not you tell me why wed wanna.
with all the reasons you give its.
its kinda hard to believe.
but who am i to tell you that i have.
seen any reason why you should stay.
maybe wed be better off.
without you anyway.
you got a one way ticket.
on your last chance ride.
gotta one way ticket.
to your suicide.
gotta one way ticket.
an theres no way out alive.
an all this crass communication.
that has left you in the cold.
is not much for consolation.
when you feel so weak and old.
but if home is where the heart is.
then theres stories to be told.
no you do not need a doctor.
no one else can heal your soul.

got your mind in submission.
got your life on the line.
but nobody pulled the trigger.
they just stepped aside.
they be down by the water.
while you watch em waving goodbye.
they be calling in the morning.
they be hanging on the phone.
they be waiting for an answer.
but you know nobodys home.
and when the bells stopped ringing.
it was nobodys fault but your own.
there were always ample warnings.
there were always subtle signs.
and you would have seen it coming.
but we gave you too much time.
and when you said.
that no ones listening.
whyd your best friend drop a dime.
sometimes we get so tired of waiting.
for a way to spend our time.
an its so easy to be social.
its so easy to be cool.
yeah its easy to be hungry.
when you aingt got shit to lose.
and i wish that i could help you.
with what you hope to find.
but i am still out here waiting.
watching reruns of my life.
when you reach the point of breaking.
know its gonna take some time.
to heal the broken memories.
that another man would need.
just to survive.
