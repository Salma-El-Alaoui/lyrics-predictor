i have been here before a few times.
and i am quite aware we are dying.
and your hands, they shake with goodbyes.
and i will take you back if youd have me.

so here i am, i am trying.
so here i am, are you ready?

come on let me hold you, touch you, feel you.
always.
kiss you, taste you, all night.
always.

and i will miss your laugh, your smile.
i will admit i am wrong if youd tell me.
i am so sick of fights, i hate them.
let us start this again, for real.

so here i am, i am trying.
so here i am, are you ready?
so here i am, i am trying.
so here i am, are you ready?

come on let me hold you, touch you, feel you.
always.
kiss you, taste you, all night.
always.
come on let me hold you, touch you, feel you.
always.
kiss you, taste you, all night.
always.
