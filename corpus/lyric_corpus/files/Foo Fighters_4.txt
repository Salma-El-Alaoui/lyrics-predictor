winding your way down on baker street.
light in your head and dead on your feet.
another crazy day.
you drink the night away.
and forget about everything.
this citys dance makes you feel so cold.
its got so many people but its got no soul.
and its taken you so long.
to find out you were wrong.
when you thought it held everything.

used to think that it was so easy.
used to say that it was so easy.
but you are trying, you are trying now.

another year and then you will be happy.
just one more year and then you will be happy.
but you are crying, you are crying now.

way down the street theres a light in his place.
he opens the door, hes got that look on his face.
and he asks where you have been.
you tell him who you have seen.
and you talk about everything.
hes got this dream about buying some land.
hes gonna give up the crack and the one night stands.
and then he will settle down.
in this quiet little town.
and forget about everything.

but you know he will always keep moving.
you know, hes never gonna stop moving.
cause hes rolling, hes a rolling stone.

when you wake up, its a new morning.
the sun is shining, its a new morning.
you are going, you are going home.
