as i was walking by saw you standing there with a smile.
looking shy you caught my eye.
thought youd want to hang for a while.

well id like to be with you and you know its friday too.
i hope you can find the time this weekend to relax and unwind.

my minds tired i have worked so hard all week.
cashed my check i am ready to go.
i promise you i will show you such a good time.

chorus.
come on baby let us get away.
let us save your troubles for another day.
come go with me we have got it made.
let me take you on an escapade let us go.

es ca pade we will have a good time.
es ca pade leave your worries behind.
es ca pade you can be mine.
es ca pade an escapade.

so do not hold back just have a good time.
we will make the rules up as we go along.
and break them all if we are not having fun.

repeat chorus.

my minds tired i have worked so hard all.
worked so hard all week.
i just got paid, we have got it made ready to go.
i promise you i will show you such a good time.

repeat chorus.
