nice guys finish last.
you are running out of gas.
your sympathy will get you left behind.
sometimes you are at your best, when you feel the worst.
do you feel washed up, like piss going down the drain.

pressure cook and bake my brain and tell me i am insane.
i am so fucking happy i could cry.
every joke can have its truth and now the jokes on you.
i never knew you were such a funny guy.

oh nice guys finish last, when you are the outcast.
do not pat yourself on the back, you might break your spine.

living on command.
you are shaking lots of hands.
kissing up and bleeding all your trust, taking what you need.
bite the hand that feeds.
you kill your memory and you got no shame.

oh nice guys finish last, when you are the outcast.

ooh!

oh nice guys finish last, when you are the outcast.
do not pat yourself on the back, you might break your spine.
oh nice guys finish last, when you are the outcast.
