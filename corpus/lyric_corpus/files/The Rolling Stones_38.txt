childhood living is easy to do.
the things you wanted i bought them for you.
graceless lady, you know who i am.
you know i can not let you slide through my hands.

wild horses could not drag me away.
wild, wild horses, could not drag me away.

i watched you suffer a dull aching pain.
now you decided to show me the same.
no sweeping exits or offstage lines.
could make me feel bitter or treat you unkind.

wild horses could not drag me away.
wild, wild horses, could not drag me away.

i know i dreamed you a sin and a lie.
i have my freedom, but i do not have much time.
faith has been broken, tears must be cried.
let us do some living, after we die.

wild horses could not drag me away.
wild, wild horses, we will ride them some day.

wild horses could not drag me away.
wild, wild horses, we will ride them some day.
