theres blood in the streets, its up to my ankles.
she came.
theres blood on the streets, its up to my knee.
she came.
blood on the streets in the town of chicago.
she came.
blood on the rise, its following me.

she came just about the break of day.
she came and then she drove away.
sunlight in her hair.

she came.
blood in the streets runs a river of sadness.
she came.
blood in the streets its up to my thigh.
she came.
yeah the river runs down the length of the city.
she came.
the women are crying red rivers of weeping.

she came into town and then she drove away.
sunlight in her hair.
indians scattered on dawns highway bleeding.
ghosts crowd the young childs fragile eggshell mind.

blood in the streets in the town of new haven.
blood stains the roofs and the palm trees of venice.
blood in my love in the terrible summer.
bloody red sun of phantastic l.a.
blood screams the pain as they chop off her fingers.
blood will be born in the birth of a nation.
blood is the rose of mysterious union.

theres blood in the streets, its up to my ankles.
blood in the streets, its up to my knee.
blood in the streets in the town of chicago.
blood on the rise, its following me.
