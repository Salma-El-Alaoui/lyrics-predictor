hes walking like a small child.
but watch his eyes burn you away.
black holes in his golden stare.
god knows he wants to go home.
children of the damned.
children of the damned.
children of the damned.
children of the damned.

hes walking like a dead man.
if he had lived he would have crucified us all.
now hes standing on the last step.
he thought oblivion, well he beckons us all.
children of the damned.
children of the damned.
children of the damned.
children of the damned.

now its burning his hands, hes turning to laugh.
smiles as the flames sear his flesh.
melting his face, screaming in pain.
peeling the skin from his eyes.
watch him die according to plan.
hes dust on the ground, what did we learn.

you are children of the damned.
your backs against the wall.
you turn into the light.
you are children of the damned.
like candles watch them burn.
burning in the light.
you will burn again tonight.
you are children of the damned..
