halls of justice painted green.
money talking.
power wolves beset your door.
hear them stalking.
soon you will please their appetite.
they devour.
hammer of justice crushes you.
overpower.

the ultimate in vanity.
exploiting their supremacy.
i can not believe the things you say.
i can not believe.
i can not believe the price you pay.

nothing can save you.
justice is lost.
justice is raped.
justice is gone.
pulling your strings.
justice is done.
seeking no truth.
winning is all.
find it so grim.
so true.
so real.

apathy their stepping stone.
so unfeeling.
hidden deep animosity.
so deceiving.
through your eyes their light burns.
hoping to find.
inquisition sinking you.
with prying minds.

the ultimate in vanity.
exploiting their supremacy.
i can not believe the things you say.
i can not believe.
i can not believe the price you pay.

nothing can save you.
justice is lost.
justice is raped.
justice is gone.
pulling your strings.
justice is done.
seeking no truth.
winning is all.
find it so grim.
so true.
so real.

lady justice has been raped.
truth assassin.
rolls of red tape seal your lips.
now you are done in.
their money tips her scales again.
make your deal.
just what is truth? i cannot tell.
cannot feel.

the ultimate in vanity.
exploiting their supremacy.
i can not believe the things you say.
i can not believe.
i can not believe the price we pay.

nothing can save us.
justice is lost.
justice is raped.
justice is gone.
pulling your strings.
justice is done.
seeking no truth.
winning is all.
find it so grim.
so true.
so real.
seeking no truth.
winning is all.
find it so grim.
so true.
so real.
