maybe life is like a ride on a freeway.
dodging bullets while you are trying to find your way.
everyones around, but no one does a damn thing.
it brings me down, but i will not let them.

if i seem bleak.
well youd be corrected.
and if i do not speak.
its cause i got disconnected.
but i will not be burned up by the reflection.
of the fire in your eyes.
as you are staring at the sun.
howooowoow.
as you are staring at the sun.
howooowoow.
as you are staring at the sun.
howooowoow.
as you are staring at the sun.
as you are staring at the sun!

hey!
when i ran i did not feel like a runaway.
hey!
when i escaped i did not feel like i got away.
hey!
theres more to living than only surviving.
maybe i am not there, but i am still trying.

though you hear me.
i do not think that you relate.
my will is something.
that you can not confiscate.
so forgive me, but i will not be frustrated.
by destruction in your eyes.
as you are staring at the sun.
howooowoow.
as you are staring at the sun.
howooowoow.
