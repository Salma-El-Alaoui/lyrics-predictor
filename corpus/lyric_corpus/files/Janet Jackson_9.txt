it aingt nothing but an us thing.

and its time for us to step it up and respect.

that level of sisterhood thats been holding up our neighborhood.

and if it was not for our mothers there would be no brothers.

and if it was not for our sisters there would be no misters.

so it aingt nothing but an us thing.

shes strong and thats a fact.

not its time for us to take up the slack.

step it up, step it up time to go to work.



history hidden from me.

to hide my identity.

so id never feel.

i am somebody.

you have gouged my eyes.

i see more clearly.

you have tried to rub me of my humanity.

my spirit you tried to break.

my soul you tried to take.

theres no need to be afraid.

ampquotcause i will not do unto you now.



chorus.

amen.

all that we have been through.

our time has come to rejoice.

a new agendas due.

amen.

its time to know the truth.

our time has come to rejoice.

a new agendas due.



because of my gender.

i have heard ampquotnoampquot too many times.

because of my race.

i have heard ampquotnoampquot to many times.

but with every ampquotnoampquot i grow in strength.

that is why.

african american women.

i stand tall with pride.

you want to know what it takes.

to rid yourself of me now.

theres nothing you can do.

accept me for who i am now.



repeat chorus.



time to step it up, step it up.

better check yourself.

i got vexed to protect what we got.

left her alone.

looking for your own.

here it is i know what i am saying.

but the klan aingt playing at the range.

gotta step it up us to a discuss a must.

it aingt nothing but an us thing.

rewind back to the time.

where the color of our mother.

had em call it a crime.

brother what in the world?

and the world says where in the black man.

support the women and the children.

time to step it up, step it up, its play off time.

and the rhyme go to check, so check yourself.



repeat chorus.
