all alone in my room, think of you at a rate that is truly alarming.
i keep looping my memories of you in my head, i pretend that you want me.
and i fall asleep and dream of alternate realities.
and i put myself at ease by pretending that she still loves me.

and i can not stop thinking about you.
and i can not stop thinking about you.
you never call, what do i do?
and i can not stop thinking about your love.

ohh, yeah.

ca not believe i could think that she would just follow me everywhere i go.
i just wrestle with you in my dreams and wake up making love to a pillow.
and i fall asleep and dream of alternate realities.
and i put myself at ease by pretending that she still loves me.

and i can not stop thinking about you.
and i can not stop thinking about you.
you never call, what do i do?
and i can not stop, and i can not stop.

what i would give to have you look in my direction.
and id give my life to somehow attract your attention.
and i touch myself like its somebody else.
thoughts of you are tattooed on my mind, let me show you.

and i can not stop thinking about you.
and i can not stop thinking about you.
you will never go, what do i do?
and i can not stop thinking about you.

and i can not stop thinking about you.
and i can not stop thinking about you.
you will never go, what do i do?
and i can not stop thinking about you.
