i was born from love.
and my poor mother worked the mines.
i was raised on the good book, jesus.
till i read between the lines.
now i do not believe i want to see the morning.

going down to stoney end.
i never wanted to go down to stoney end.
mama, let me start all over.
cradle me, mama cradle me again.

i can still remember him.
with lovelight in his eyes.
but the light flickered out and parted.
as the sun began to rise.
now i do not believe i want to see the morning.

going down to stoney end.
i never wanted to go down to stoney end.
mama, let me start all over.
cradle me, mama cradle me again.
cradle me, mama cradle me again.
mama cradle me again.

never mind the forecast.
cause the sky has lost control.
cause the fury and the broken thunders.
come to match my raging soul.
now i do not believe i want to see the morning.

going down to stoney end.
i never wanted to go down to stoney end.
mama, let me start all over.
cradle me, mama cradle me again.

going down to stoney end.
i never wanted to go, i never wanted to go.
going down to stoney end.
i never wanted to go, i never wanted to go.
going down to stoney end.
i never wanted to go, i never wanted to go.
