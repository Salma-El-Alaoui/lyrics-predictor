father has a business.
strictly second hand.
everything from tooth picks to a baby grand.
stuff in our apartment.
came from fathers store.
even things i am wearing, someone wore before.
its no wonder that i feel abused.
i never get a thing that aingt been used!

i am wearing second hand hats.
second hand clothes.
thats why the call me second hand rose.
even our piano in the parlor.
father bought for ten cents on the dollar.
second hand pearls.
i am wearing second hand curls.
i never get a single thing thats new!
even jake the plumber, hes the man i adore.
had the nerve to tell me hed been married before!
everyone knows that i am just second hand rose.
from second avenue.

i am wearing second hand shoes.
second hand hose.
all the girls hand me their second hand beaus!
even my pajamas, when i don them.
have somebody elses nitials on them.
second hand rings, i am sick of second hand things.
i never get what other girliess do.
once while strolling through the ritz, a girl got my goat.
she nudged her friend and said, oh, look, there goes my old fur coat!
everyone knows that i am just second hand rose.
from second avenue..
