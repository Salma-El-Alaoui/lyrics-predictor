midnight not a sound from the pavement.
has the moon lost her memory?
she is smiling alone.
in the lamplight, the withered leaves collect at my feet.
and the wind begins to moan.

memory, all alone in the moonlight.
i can dream of the old days.
life was beautiful then.
i remember the time i knew what happiness was.
let the memory live again.

every streetlamp seems to beat.
a fatalistic warning.
someone mutters and the street lamp gutters.
and soon.
it will be morning.

daylight.
i must wait for the sunrise.
i must think of a new life.
and i must not give in.
when the dawn comes, tonight will be a memory too.
and a new day will begin.

music interlude.

burnt out ends of smoky days.
the stale cold smell of morning.
a streetlamp dies another night is over.
another day is dawning...

touch me!
its so easy to leave me.
all alone with the memory.
of my days in the sun...
if you touch me, you will understand what happiness is.
look, a new day has begun..
