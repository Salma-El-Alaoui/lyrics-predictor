i can not see your face in my mind.
i can not see your face in my mind.
carnival dogs consume the lines.
ca not see your face in my mind.

do not you cry.
baby, please do not cry.
and do not look at me with your eyes.

i can not seem to find the right lie.
i can not seem to find the right lie.
insanitys horse adorns the sky.
ca not seem to find the right lie.

carnival dogs consume the lines.
ca not see your face in my mind.

do not you cry.
baby, please do not cry.
i will not need your picture until we say goodbye.
