keep hiding down into your brain.
and make your only cost.
you just might wear your welcome out if you do not let it go.

and theres nothing that you could not say.
cause you said it all before.
think its time you walk this lonely road all on your own.

its your cold day in the sun.
looks like your bleeding heart.
has already won.

wish i could take it away.
and save you from yourself.
you get so lost inside your head like no one else.

looking for someone to blame.
blame me all along.
you will take the heat, but you would never take the fall.

its your cold day in the sun.
looks like your bleeding heart.
has already won.

you are so afraid.
that you are the only one.
that you are the only one.
you know.

do not be afraid.
cause your not the only one.
you are not the only one.
i know.

its your cold day in the sun.
looks like your bleeding heart.
has already won.

its your cold day in the sun.
looks like your bleeding heart.
has already won.
