yeah, yeah.

high, higher than the sun.
you shoot me from a gun.
i need you to elevate me here.
at the corner of your lips.
as the orbit of your hips.
eclipse, you elevate my soul.

i have got no self control.
been living like a mole now.
going down, excavation.
i and i in the sky.
you make me feel like i can fly so high.
elevation.

a star lit up like a cigar.
strung out like a guitar.
maybe you could educate my mind.
explain all these controls.
i can not sing but i have got soul.
the goal is elevation.

a mole, digging in a hole.
digging up my soul now.
going down, excavation.
i and i in the sky.
you make me feel like i can fly so high.
elevation.

love, lift me out of these blues.
will not you tell me something true.
i believe in you.

a mole, digging in a hole.
digging up my soul now.
going down, excavation.
i and i in the sky.
you make me feel like i can fly so high.
elevation.

elevation.
elevation.
elevation.
elevation.
