both.
there was a time when we were down and out.
there was a place when we were starting over.
we let the bough break.
we let the heartache in.
whos sorry now.
whos sorry now.

barbra.
there was a world when we were standing still.
and for a moment we were separated.
and then you found her.
you let the stranger in.
together.
whos sorry now.

barbra.
whos sorry now.
what , what kind of fool.
tears it apart.
leaving me pain and sorrow.

barry.
losing you now.
wondering why.
where will i be tomorrow.

chorus.
forever more thats what we are to be.
without each other.
we will be remembering when...

both.
there was a time when we were down and out.
we cried.
there was a place when we were starting over.
we lied.
we let the bough break.
we let the heartache in.
whos sorry now.
whos sorry now.

barbra.
what , what kind of fool.

barry.
what , what kind of fool.

barbra.
tears it apart.

barry.
tears it apart.

barbra.
leaving me pain and sorrow.

barry.
oh! losing you now.
how can i win.
where will i be tomorrow.

barbra.
was there a moment when i cut you down.
played around.
what have i done.
i only apologize.
for being as they say, the last to know.
it has to show.
when someone is in your eyes.

both.
what, what kind of fool.
tears it apart.
leaving me pain and sorrow.
losing you now.
wondering why.
where will i be tomorrow.
what, what kind of fool.
tears it apart.
leaving me pain and sorrow.
losing you now.
how can i win.
where will i be tomorrow.
