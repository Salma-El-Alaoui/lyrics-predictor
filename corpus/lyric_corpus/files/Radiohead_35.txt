you can not take it with you.
dancing for your pleasure.

you are not to blame for.
bittersweet distractor.
dare not speak its name.
dedicated to all you.
all human beings.

because we separate.
like ripples on a blank shore.
in rainbows.
because we separate.
like ripples on a blank shore.
in rainbows.

take me with you.
dedicated to all you.
all human beings.
