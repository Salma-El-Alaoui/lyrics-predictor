come for me.

i can feel your body.

pressed against my body.

wrap yourself around me.

love to see you throbbing.

throb.

throb.

throb.

i can feel your body.

pressed against my body.

when you start to pounding.

love to see you throbbing.

throb.

throb.

throb.

boom boom boom.

until noon, noon, noon.
