i will not let you down.
i will not give you up.
gotta have some faith in the sound.
its the one good thing that i have got.
i will not let you down.
so please do not give me up.
because i would really, really love to stick around.

heaven knows i was just a young boy.
did not know what i wanted to be.
i was every little hungry schoolgirls pride and joy.
and i guess it was enough for me.
to win the race? a prettier face!
brand new clothes and a big fat place.
on your rock and roll tv.
but today the way i play the game is not the same.
no way.
think i am gonna get me some happy.

i think theres something you should know.
i think its time i told you so.
theres something deep inside of me.
theres someone else i have got to be.
take back your picture in a frame.
take back your singing in the rain.
i just hope you understand.
sometimes the clothes do not make the man.

all we have to do now.
is take these lies and make them true somehow.
all we have to see.
is that i do not belong to you.
and you do not belong to me.
freedom.
you have gotta give for what you take.
freedom.
you have gotta give for what you take.

heaven knows we sure had some fun boy.
what a kick just a buddy and me.
we had every big shot good time band on the run boy.
we were living in a fantasy.
we won the race.
got out of the place.
i went back home got a brand new face.
for the boys on mtv.
but today the way i play the game has got to change.
oh yeah.
now i am gonna get myself happy.

i think theres something you should know.
i think its time i stopped the show.
theres something deep inside of me.
theres someone i forgot to be.
take back your picture in a frame.
do not think that i will be back again.
i just hope you understand.
sometimes the clothes do not make the man.

all we have to do now.
is take these lies and make them true somehow.
all we have to see.
is that i do not belong to you.
and you do not belong to me.
freedom.
you have gotta give for what you take.
freedom.
you have gotta give for what you take.

well it looks like the road to heaven.
but it feels like the road to hell.
when i knew which side my bread was buttered.
i took the knife as well.
posing for another picture.
everybodys got to sell.
but when you shake your ass.
they notice fast.
and some mistakes were built to last.

thats what you get.

i say thats what you get.

thats what you get for changing your mind.

and after all this time.
i just hope you understand.
sometimes the clothes.
do not make the man.

i will hold on to my freedom.
may not be what you want from me.
just the way its got to be.
lose the face now.
i have got to live.
