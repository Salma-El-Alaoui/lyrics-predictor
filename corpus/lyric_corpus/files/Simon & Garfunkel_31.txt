so long, frank lloyd wright.
i can not believe your song is gone so soon.
i barely learned the tune.
so soon.
so soon.

i will remember frank lloyd wright.
all of the nights wed harmonize till dawn.
i never laughed so long.
so long.
so long.

chorus.
architects may come and.
architects may go and.
never change your point of view.
when i run dry.
i stop awhile and think of you.

so long, frank lloyd wright.
all of the nights wed harmonize till dawn.
i never laughed so long.
so long.
so long.
so long.
so long.
so long.
so long.
