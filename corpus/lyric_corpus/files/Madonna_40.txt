chorus first time without background vocals.

this used to be my playground used to be.
this used to be my childhood dream.
this used to be the place i ran to.
whenever i was in need.
of a friend.
why did it have to end.
and why do they always say.

do not look back.
keep your head held high.
do not ask them why.
because life is short.
and before you know.
you are feeling old.
and your heart is breaking.
do not hold on to the past.
well thats too much to ask.

long and movie versions only.

chorus.
live and learn.
well the years they flew.
and we never knew.
we were foolish then.
we would never tire.
and that little fire.
is still alive in me.
it will never go away.
ca not say goodbye to yesterday ca not say goodbye.

chorus.

no regrets.
but i wish that you.
were here with me.
well then theres hope yet.
i can see your face.
in our secret place.
you are not just a memory.
say goodbye to yesterday the dream.
those are words i will never say i will never say.

this used to be my playground used to be.
this used to be our pride and joy.
this used to be the place we ran to.
that no one in the world could dare destroy.

short and movie versions only.

this used to be our playground used to be.
this used to be our childhood dream.
this used to be the place we ran to.
i wish you were standing here with me.

movie version only.

this used to be our playground used to be.
this used to be our great escape.
this used to be the place we ran to.
this used to be our secret hiding place.

this used to be our playground used to be.
this used to be our childhood dream.
this used to be the place we ran to.
the best things in life are always free.
wishing you were here with me.
