dearly beloved.
we are gathered here today.
to get through this thing called life.
electric word life.
it means forever and thats a mighty long time.
but i am here to tell you, theres something else.
the afterworld.
a world of never ending happiness.
you can always see the sun, day or night.
so when you call up that shrink in beverly hills.
you know the one, dr. everything will be alright.
instead of asking him how much of your time is left.
ask him how much of your mind, baby.
cause in this life.
things are much harder than in the afterworld.
in this life, you are on your own.
and if de elevator tries to bring you down.
go crazy, punch a higher floor.

if you do not like.
the world you are living in.
take a look around you.
at least you got friends.
i called my old lady.
for a friendly word.
she just picked up the phone.
dropped it on the floor.
aah, aah! is all i heard.

i am not gonna let de elevator bring us down, oh no, let us go.
let us go crazy, let us get nuts.
let us look for the purple banana.
til they put us in the truck.
let us go.

all excited, but do not know why.
maybe its cause, we are all gonna die.
and when we do when we do.
whats it all for? whats it all for.
better live now.
before the grim reaper comes knocking on your door.
tell me baby.
are we gonna let de elevator bring us down?
oh, no, let us go.

let us go crazy, let us get nuts.
let us look for the purple banana.
til they put us in the truck.
let us go.

come on baby, let us get nuts!
yeah, crazy.

let us go crazy.

are we gonna let de elevator bring us down?
oh, no, let us go.

go crazy.
i said, let us go crazy.

dr. everything will be alright.
make everything go wrong.
pills and thrills and daffodils will kill.
hang tough children.

hes coming.
hes coming.
coming.


take me away.
