little deuce coupe.
you do not know what i got.

well i am not bragging babe so do not put me down.
but i have got the fastest set of wheels in town.
when something comes up to me he do not even try.
cause if i had a set of wings man i know she could fly.
shes my little deuce coupe you do not know what i got.

just a little deuce coupe with a flat head mill.
but she will walk a thunderbird like shes standing still.
shes ported and relieved and shes stroked and bored.
she will do a hundred and forty with the top end floored.
shes my little deuce coupe you do not know what i got.

shes got a competition clutch with the four on the floor.
and she purrs like a kitten till the lake pipes roar.
and if that aingt nough to make you flip your lid.
theres one more thing i got the pink slip daddy.

and coming off the line when the light turns green.
well she blows em outta the water like you never seen.
i get pushed out of shape and its hard to steer.
when i get rubber in all four gears.
shes my little deuce coupe you do not know what i got.
