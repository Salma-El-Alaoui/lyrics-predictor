ooh, a storm is threatning.
my very life today.
if i do not get some shelter.
oh yeah, i am gonna fade away.

war, children, its just a shot away.
its just a shot away.
war, children, its just a shot away.
its just a shot away.

ooh, see the fire is sweeping.
our very street today.
burns like a red coal carpet.
mad bull lost its way.

war, children, yes, its just a shot away.
its just a shot away.
war, children, its just a shot away.
its just a shot away.

rape, murder, its just a shot away.

its just a shot away.
rape, murder, its just a shot away.
its just a shot away.

my very life today.
gimme, gimme shelter.
or i am gonna fade away.

war, children, its just a shot away.
