watch it!

i was born in a cross fire hurricane.
and i howled at my ma in the driving rain.

but its all right now, in fact its a gas.
but its all right, i am jumping jack flash.
its a gas, gas, gas.

i was raised by a toothless, bearded hag.
i was schooled with a strap right across my back.

but its all right now, in fact its a gas.
but its all right, i am jumping jack flash.
its a gas, gas, gas.
ooh.

i was drowned, i was washed up and left for dead.
i fell down to my feet and i saw they bled, yeah yeah.
i frowned at the crumbs of a crust of bread, yeah yeah yeah.
i was crowned with a spike right through my head.

but its all right now, in fact its a gas.
but its all right, i am jumping jack flash.
its a gas, gas, gas.

jumping jack flash, its a gas.
jumping jack flash, its a gas.
jumping jack flash, its a gas.
jumping jack flash, its a gas.
jumping jack flash, its a gas.
jumping jack flash, its a gas.
