hahahahaha.

i am on the run, i will kill to eat.
starving now, feeling dead on my feet.
going all the way, i am natures beast.
do what i want, i do as i please.

run, you have gotta fight, to breathe, its tough.
now you see me, now you do not.
break the walls, i am coming out.

i am not a prisoner, i am a free man.
and my blood is my own now.
do not care where the past was.
i know where i am going...out.

if you kill me, its self defence.
if i kill you, then i call it vengeance.
spit in your eye, i will defy.
you will be afraid when i call out your name.

run, you have gotta fight, to breathe, its tough.

i am not a prisoner, i am a free man.

from your black book.
