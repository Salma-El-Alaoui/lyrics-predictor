london calling to the far away towns.
now war is declared and battle come down.
london calling to the underworld.
come out of the cupboard, you boys and girls.
london calling, now do not look at us.
phoney beatlemania has bitten the dust.
london calling, see we aingt got no swing.
cept for the ring of that truncheon thing.

the ice age is coming, the sun zooming in.
meltdown expected, the wheat is growing thin.
engines stop running, but i have no fear.
cause london is drowning and i   live by the river.

london calling to the imitation zone.
forget it, brother, you can go it alone.
london calling to the zombies of death.
quit holding out  and draw another breath.
london calling  and i do not wanna shout.
but while we were talking  i saw you nodding out.
london calling, see we aingt got no highs.
except for that one with the yellowy eyes.

the ice age is coming, the sun is zooming in.
engines stop running, the wheat is growing thin.
a nuclear error, but i have no fear.
cause london is drowning and i   i live by the river.
x2.

now get this!
london calling, yes, i was there, too.
an you know what they said? well, some of it was true!
london calling at the top of the dial.
after all this, will not you give me a smile?

london calling.

i never felt so much alike.
