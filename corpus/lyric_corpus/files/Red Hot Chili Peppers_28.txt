how long how long will i slide.
separate my side.
i do not.
i do not believe its fair.
slitting my throat.
its all i ever.

i heard your voice through a photograph.
i thought it up and brought up the past.
once you know you can never go back.
i have got to take it on the otherside.

centuries are what it meant to me.
a cemetery where i married the sea.
stranger things could never change my mind.
i have got to take it on the otherside.
take it on the otherside.
take it on.
take it on.

how long how long will i slide.
separate my side.
i do not.
i do not believe its fair.
slitting my throat.
its all i ever.

pour my life into a paper cup.
the ashtrays full and i am spilling my guts.
she wants to know am i still a slut.
i have got to take it on the otherside.

a scarlet starlet and shes in my bed.
a candidate for a soul mate bled.
push the trigger and pull the thread.
i have got to take it on the otherside.
take it on the otherside.
take it on.
take it on.

how long how long will i slide.
separate my side.
i do not.
i do not believe its fair.
slitting my throat.
its all i ever.

turn me on, take me for a hard ride.
burn me out leave me on the otherside.
i yell and tell it that.
its not my friend.
i tear it down i tear it down.
but then its born again.

how long how long will i slide.
separate my side.
i do not.
i do not believe its fair.
slitting my throat.
its all i ever.
how long... how long.
i do not.
i do not believe its fair.
slitting my throat.
its all i ever.
