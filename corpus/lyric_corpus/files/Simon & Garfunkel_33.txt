slow down.
you move too fast.
you have got to make the morning last.
just kicking down the cobble stones.
looking for fun and feeling groovy.
ba da da da da da da.
feeling groovy.

hello lamppost.
whatcha knowing?
i have come to watch your flowers growing.
aingtcha got no rhymes for me?
do do do do.
feeling groovy.
ba da da da da da da.
feeling groovy.

i got no deeds to do.
no promises to keep.
i am dappled and drowsy and ready to sleep.
let the morning time drop all its petals on me.
life i love you.
all is groovy.
ba da da da da da da.
