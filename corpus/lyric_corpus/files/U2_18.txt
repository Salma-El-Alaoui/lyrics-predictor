johnny, take a walk with your sister the moon.
let her pale light in, to fill up your room.
you have been living underground, eating from a can.
you have been running away from what you do not understand.

shes slippy, you are sliding down.
she will be there when you hit the ground.

its alright, its alright, its alright.
she moves in mysterious ways.
its alright, its alright, its alright.
she moves in mysterious ways, oh.

johnny, take a dive with your sister in the rain.
let her talk about the things you can not explain.
to touch is to heal, to hurt is to steal.
if you want to kiss the sky, better learn how to kneel.
on your knees, boy!

shes the wave, she turns the tide.
she sees the man inside the child.

its alright, its alright, its alright.
she moves in mysterious ways.
its alright, its alright, its alright.
she moves in mysterious ways, yeah, oh, ah.

lift my days, light up my nights, oh.

one day you will look back, and you will see.
where you were held now by this love.
while you could stand there.
you could move on this moment.
follow this feeling.

its alright, its alright, its alright.
she moves in mysterious ways.
its alright, its alright, its alright.
she moves in mysterious ways.

move you, spirits move you.
move, spirits its move you, oh yeah.
does it move you?
she moves with it.
lift my days, and light up my nights, oh..
