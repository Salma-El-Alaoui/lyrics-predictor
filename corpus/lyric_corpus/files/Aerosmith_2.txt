i am alone, yeah, i do not know if i can face the night.
i am in tears and the crying that i do is for you.
i want your love, let us break the walls between us.
do not make it tough, i will put away my pride.
enoughs enough, i have suffered and i have seen the light.

baby.
you are my angel, come and save me tonight.
you are my angel, come and make it all right.

do not know what i am gonna do about this feeling inside.
yes its true, loneliness took me for a ride.
without your love, i am nothing but a beggar.
without your love, a dog without a bone.
what can i do, i am sleeping in this bed alone.

baby.
you are my angel, come and save me tonight.
you are my angel, come and make it all right.
come and save me tonight.

you are the reason i live.
you are the reason i die.
you are the reason i give when i break down and cry.
do not need no reason why.

baby, baby, baby.
you are my angel, come and save me tonight.
you are my angel, come and make it all right.

you are my angel, come and save me tonight.
you are my angel, come and make it all right.
come and save me tonight.
come and save me tonight.
come and save me tonight.
come and save me tonight.
come and save me tonight.
