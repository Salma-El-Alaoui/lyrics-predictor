i sit and wait.
does an angel contemplate my fate.
and do they know.
the places where we go.
when we are grey and old.
cause i have been told.
that salvation lets their wings unfold.

so when i am lying in my bed.
thoughts running through my head.
and i feel that love is dead.
i am loving angels instead.

and through it all she offers me protection.
a lot of love and affection.
whether i am right or wrong.
and down the waterfall.
wherever it may take me.
i know that life will not break me.
when i come to call.
she will not forsake me.
i am loving angels instead.

when i am feeling weak.
and my pain walks down a one way street.
i look above.
and i know i will always be blessed with love.

and as the feeling grows.
she brings flesh to my bones.
and when love is dead.
i am loving angels instead.

and through it all she offers me protection.
a lot of love and affection.
whether i am right or wrong.
and down the waterfall.
wherever it may take me.
i know that life will not break me.
when i come to call.
she will not forsake me.
i am loving angels instead.

instrumental.

and through it all she offers me protection.
a lot of love and affection.
whether i am right or wrong.
and down the waterfall.
wherever it may take me.
i know that life will not break me.
when i come to call.
she will not forsake me.
i am loving angels instead.
