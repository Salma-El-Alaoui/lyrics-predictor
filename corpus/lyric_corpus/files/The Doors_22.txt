i wanna tell you bout texas radio and the big beat.
comes out of the virginia swamps.
cool and slow with plenty of precision.
with a back beat narrow and hard to master.

some call it heavenly in its brilliance.
others, mean and rueful of the western dream.
i love the friends i have gathered together on this thin raft.
we have constructed pyramids in honor of our escaping.
this is the land where the pharaoh died.

the negroes in the forest brightly feathered.
they are saying, forget the night.
live with us in forests of azure.
out here on the perimeter there are no stars.
out here we is stoned   immaculate.

listen to this, and i will tell you bout the heartache.
i will tell you bout the heartache and the lose of god.
i will tell you bout the hopeless night.
the meager food for souls forgot.
i will tell you bout the maiden with wrought iron soul.

i will tell you this.
no eternal reward will forgive us now for wasting the dawn.

i will tell you bout texas radio and the big beat.
soft driving, slow and mad, like some new language.

now, listen to this, and i will tell you bout the texas.
i will tell you bout the texas radio.
i will tell you bout the hopeless night.
wandering the western dream.
tell you bout the maiden with wrought iron soul.
