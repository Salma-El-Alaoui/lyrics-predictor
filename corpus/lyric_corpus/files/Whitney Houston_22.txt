i am here alone on a friday night.
waiting here beside the phone.
the tv, radio and me.
really aingt been getting along.

i wish that i could fly away.
and party till the break of day.
and there id be sure to meet.
the guy that would be special to me.

then mama comes and asks me.
why am i dreaming sitting alone?
why not go out and have some fun.
its the only way i will ever find.
someone for me.
while i am young and seventeen.

chorus.
someone for me.
someone for me.
i have got to go find someone, someone.
someone for me.
i have got to find someone, yeah!


now heres a party down at angies house.
with people packed against the wall.
i am sitting in the corner here.
trying to make some sense of it all.

and when i least expect it.
meeting the guy i see in my dreams.
here he is walking up to me and asking.
if id like to come and dance with him.
i think i have found someone for me.

repeat chorus.

and so i am finding out that dreams you believe in.
can come to be.
and now i am looking up to find the joy and happiness.
can come to you and me.
at last i have found someone for me.

repeat chorus.
