found myself today singing out your name.
you said i am crazy.
if i am i am crazy for you.

sometimes sitting in the dark wishing you were here.
turns me crazy.
but its you who makes me lose my head.

and every time i am meant to be acting sensible.
you drift into my head.
and turn me into a crumbling fool.

tell me to run and i will race.
if you want me to stop i will freeze.
and if you are me gonna leave, just hold me closer baby.
and make me crazy for you.
crazy for you.

lately with this state i am in i can not help myself but spin.
i wish youd come over.
send me spinning closer to you.

my oh my, how my blood boils, its sweet taste for you.
strips me down bare.
and gets me into my favourite mood.

i keep on trying, fighting these feelings away.
but the more i do.
the crazier i turn into.

pacing floors and opening doors.
hoping you will walk through.
and save me boy.
because i am too crazy for you.
crazy for you.
