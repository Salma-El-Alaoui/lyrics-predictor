spent my days with a woman unkind.
smoked my stuff and drank all my wine.
made up my mind to make a new start.
going to california with an aching in my heart.
someone told me theres a girl out there.
with love in her eyes and flowers in her hair.

took my chances on a big jet plane.
never let them tell you that they are all the same.
oh, the sea was red and the sky was grey.
wondered how tomorrow could ever follow today.
the mountains and the canyons started to tremble and shake.
as the children of the sun began to awake.
watch out.

seems that the wrath of the gods got a punch on the nose.
and it started to flow, i think i might be sinking.
throw me a line, if i reach it in time.
i will meet you up there where the path runs straight and high.

to find a queen without a king.
they say she plays guitar and cries and sings, la la la la la.
ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn.
trying to find a woman whos never, never, never been born.
standing on a hill in my mountain of dreams.
telling myself its not as hard, hard, hard as it seems.
