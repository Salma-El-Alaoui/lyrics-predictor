theres only so much you can learn in one place.
the more that i wait, the more time that i waste.


i have not got much time to waste, its time to make my way.
i am not afraid of what i will face, but i am afraid to stay.
i am going down my own road and i can make it alone.
i will work and i will fight till i find a place of my own.

are you ready to jump?
get ready to jump.
do not ever look back, oh baby.
yes i am ready to jump, just take my hand.
get ready to jump.

we learned our lesson from the start, my sisters and me.
the only thing you can depend on is your family.
lifes gonna drop you down like the limbs of a tree.
it sways and it swings and it bends until it makes you see.

get ready to jump.
do not ever look back, oh baby.
yes i am ready to jump, just take my hand.
get ready to, are you ready?
