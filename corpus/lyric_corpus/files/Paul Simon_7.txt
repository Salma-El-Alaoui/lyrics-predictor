i met my old lover.
on the street last night.
she seemed so glad to see me.
i just smiled.
and we talked about some old times.
and we drank ourselves some beers.
still crazy after all these years.
still crazy after all these years.

i am not the kind of man.
who tends to socialize.
i seem to lean on.
old familiar ways.
and i aingt no fool for love songs.
that whisper in my ears.
still crazy after all these years.
still crazy after all these years.

four in the morning.
crapped out.
yawning.
longing my life away.
i will never worry.
why should i?
its all gonna fade.

now i sit by my window.
and i watch the cars.
i fear i will do some damage.
one fine day.
but i would not be convicted.
by a jury of my peers.
still crazy.
still crazy.
still crazy after all these years.
