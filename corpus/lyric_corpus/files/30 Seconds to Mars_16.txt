a revolution has begun today for me inside.
the ultimate defence is to pretend.
revolve around yourself just like an ordinary man.
the only other option to forget.

does it feel like we have ever been alive?
does it seem like its only just begun?

to find yourself just look inside the wreckage of your past.
to lose it all you have to do is lie.
the policy is set and we are never turning back.
its time for execution time to execute.
time for execution time to execute!

does it feel like we have ever been alive?
does it seem like its only just begun?
does it feel like we have ever been alive inside?
does it seem like its only just begun?
its only just begun.

the evolution is coming!
a revolution has begun!
it has begun!
the evolution is coming!
a revolution has, yeah!

the evolution is coming!
a revolution has begun!
it has begun!
the evolution is coming!
a revolution has, yeah!

revolution.
