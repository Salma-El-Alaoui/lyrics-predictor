possessions never meant anything to me.
i am not crazy cause i have got none.
we will thats not true, i have got a bed and a guitar.
and a dog named dog who pisses on my floor.
thats right, i have got a floor.
so what, so what, so what?
i have got pockets full of kleenex and lint and holes.
where everything important to me.
just seems to fall right down my leg.
and on to the floor.
my closest friend, linoleum.
linoleum.
supports my head, gives me something to believe.
thats me on the beachside combing the sand.
metal meter in my hand.
sporting a pocket full change.
thats me on the street with a violin under my chin.
playing with a grin, singing gibberish.
thats me on the back of the bus.
thats me in the cell.
thats me inside your head.
thats me inside your head.
