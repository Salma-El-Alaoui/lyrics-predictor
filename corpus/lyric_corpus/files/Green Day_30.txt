roaming round your house.
wasting your time.
no obligation, just.
wasting your time.
so why are you alone ?
wasting your time.
when you could be with me.
wasting your time.

i am a waste like you.
with nothing else to do.
may i waste your time too ?

warding off regrets.
wasting your time.
smoking cigarettes.
wasting your time.
i am just a parasite.
wasting your time.
applying myself to.
wasting your time.

well, i am a waste like you.
with nothing else to do.
may i waste your time too ?

so why are you alone ?
wasting your time.
when you could be with me.
wasting your time.

well, i am a waste like you.
with nothing else to do.
may i waste your time too ?
may i waste your time too ?
may i waste your time too ?
may i waste your time too ?
