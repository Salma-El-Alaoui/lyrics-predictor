sometimes i feel.
like i do not have a partner.
sometimes i feel.
like my only friend.
is the city i live in.
the city of angels.
lonely as i am.
together we cry.

i drive on her streets.
cause shes my companion.
i walk through her hills.
cause she knows who i am.
she sees my good deeds.
and she kisses me windy.
i never worry.
now that is a lie.

i do not ever want to feel.
like i did that day.
take me to the place i love.
take me all the way.

its hard to believe.
that theres nobody out there.
its hard to believe.
that i am all alone.
at least i have her love.
the city she loves me.
lonely as i am.
together we cry.

i do not ever want to feel.
like i did that day.
take me to the place i love.
take me all the way.

under the bridge downtown.
is where i drew some blood.
under the bridge downtown.
i could not get enough.
under the bridge downtown.
forgot about my love.
under the bridge downtown.
i gave my life away.
