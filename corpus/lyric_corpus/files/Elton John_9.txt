i can not light no more.
of your darkness.
all my pictures seem to fade.
to black and white.
i am growing tired.
and time stands.
still before me.
frozen here on the.
ladder of my life.

too late to save myself.
from falling.
i took a chance and.
changed your way of life.
but you misread my meaning.
when i met you.
closed the door and left me.
blinded by the light.

do not let the sun go down on me.
although i have searched myself.
its always someone else i see.
i just allow a fragment of your life.
to wander free.
but losing everything is like.
the sun going down on me.

i can not find, oh.
the right romantic line.
but see me once.
and see the way i feel.
do not discard me just because.
you think i mean you harm.
but these cuts i have.
oh they need love.
to help them heal.

do not let the sun go down on me.
although i have searched myself.
its always someone else i see.
i just allow a fragment.
of your life to wander free.
but losing everything is like.
the sun going down on me.

do not let the sun go down on me.
although i have searched myself.
its always someone else i see.
i just allow a fragment.
of your life to wander free.
but losing everything is like.
the sun going down on me..
