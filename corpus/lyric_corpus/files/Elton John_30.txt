if you feel that its real i am on trial.
and i am here in your prison.
like a coin in your mint.
i am dented and i am spent with high treason.

through a glass eye your throne.
is the one danger zone.
take me to the pilot for control.
take me to the pilot of your soul.

take me to the pilot.
lead me through the chamber.
take me to the pilot.
i am but a stranger.

take me to the pilot.
lead me through the chamber.
take me to the pilot.
i am but a stranger.

well i know hes not old.
and i am told hes a virgin.
for he may be she.
but what i am told is never for certain.
