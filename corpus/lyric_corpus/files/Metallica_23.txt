thunder and lightning the gods take revenge.
senseless destruction.
victims of fury are cowardly now.
running for safety.
stabbing the harlot to pay for her sins.
leaving the virgin.
suicide running as if it were free.
ripping and tearing.

oh through the mist and the madness.
we are trying to get the message to you.
metal militia.
metal militia.
metal militia.

chained and shadowed to be left behind.
nine and one thousand.
metal militia for your sacrifice.
iron clad soldiers.
join or be conquered the law of the land.
what will befall you.
the metalization of your inner soul.
twisting and turning.

oh through the mist and the madness.
we are trying to get the message to you.
metal militia.
metal militia.
metal militia.

we are as one as we all are the same.
fighting for one cause.
leather and metal are our uniforms.
protecting what we are.
joining together to take on the world.
with our heavy metal.
spreading the message to everyone here.
come let yourself go.

oh through the mist and the madness.
we are trying to get the message to you.
metal militia.
metal militia.
metal militia.
