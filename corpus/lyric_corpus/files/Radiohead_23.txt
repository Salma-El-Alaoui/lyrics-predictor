i am on a roll.
i am on a roll this time.
i feel my luck could change.

kill me sarah.
kill me again with love.
its gonna be a glorious day.

pull me out of the air crash.
pull me out of the lake.
cause i am your superhero.
we are standing on the edge.

the head of state has called for me by name.
but i do not have time for him.
its gonna be a glorious day!
i feel my luck could change.

pull me out of the air crash.
pull me out of the lake.
cause i am your superhero.
we are standing on the edge.

we are standing on the edge.
