and you can not seem to find out why.

let us just get away.
we can spend the night, till the morning light.

you could be.
an angel among society.
but you get crushed.
from what you see.
you try to hard to help and thats enough for me.

try to change what you can.
and accept all the things that you cannot.
do not stress yourself baby.
