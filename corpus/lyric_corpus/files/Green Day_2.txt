do you know whats worth fighting for?
when its not worth dying for?
does it take your breath away.
and you feel yourself suffocating?

does the pain weigh out the pride?
and you look for a place to hide?
did someone break your heart inside?
you are in ruins.

one, 21 guns.
lay down your arms, give up the fight.
one, 21 guns.
throw up your arms into the sky, you and i.

when you are at the end of the road.
and you lost all sense of control.
and your thoughts have taken their toll.
when your mind breaks the spirit of your soul.

your faith walks on broken glass.
and the hangover does not pass.
nothings ever built to last.
you are in ruins.

one, 21 guns.
lay down your arms, give up the fight.
one, 21 guns.
throw up your arms into the sky, you and i.

did you try to live on your own.
when you burned down the house and home?
did you stand too close to the fire.
like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone?

when its time to live and let die.
and you can not get another try.
something inside this heart has died.
you are in ruins.

one, 21 guns.
lay down your arms, give up the fight.
one, 21 guns.
throw up your arms into the sky.

one, 21 guns.
lay down your arms, give up the fight.
one, 21 guns.
throw up your arms into the sky, you and i.
