blue eyes babys got blue eyes.
like a deep blue sea.
on a blue blue day.
blue eyes, babys got blue eyes.
when the morning comes.
i will be far away.
and i say.

blue eyes holding back the tears.
holding back the pain.
babys got blue eyes.
and shes alone again.

blue eyes babys got blue eyes.
like a clear blue sky.
watching over me.
blue eyes ooh i love blue eyes.
when i am by her side.
where i long to be.
i will see.

blue eyes laughing in the sun.
laughing in the rain.
babys got blue eyes.
and i am home.
and i am home again.

blue eyes laughing in the sun.
laughing in the rain.
babys got blue eyes.
and i am home again.
