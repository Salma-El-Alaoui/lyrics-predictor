i saw her today at the reception.
a glass of wine in her hand.
i knew she would meet her connection.
at her feet was her footloose man.

you can not always get what you want.
you can not always get what you want.

you get what you need.

i went down to the demonstration.
to get my fair share of abuse.
singing we are gonna vent our frustration.

i went down to the chelsea drug store.
to get your prescription filled.
i was standing in line with mr. jimmy.
and man, did he look pretty ill.

we decided that we would have a soda.
my favourite flavour, cherry red.
i sung my song to mr. jimmy.
yeah, and he said one word to me, and that was dead.
i said to him.

i saw her today at the reception.
in her glass was a bleeding man.
she was practiced at the art of deception.
well i could tell by her blood stained hands.
