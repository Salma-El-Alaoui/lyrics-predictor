the preacher talked to me and he smiled.
said, come and walk with me, come and walk one more mile.
now for once in your life you are alone.
but you aingt got a dime, theres no time for the phone.

i have just got to get a message to you, hold on, hold on.
one more hour and my life will be through, hold on, hold on.

i told him i am in no hurry.
but if i broke her heart, will not you tell her i am sorry.
and for once in my life i am alone.
and i have got to let her know just in time before i go.



i have just go to get a message to you, hold on, hold on.
one more hour and my life will be through, hold on, hold on.

well i laughed but that did not hurt.
and its only her love that keeps me wearing this dirt.
now i am crying but deep down inside.
well i did it to him, now its my turn to die.

i have just got to get a message to you, hold on, hold on.
one more hour and my life will be through, hold on, hold on..
