you believe theres something else.
to relieve your emptiness.
and you dream about yourself.
and you bleed and breathe the air.
and its on and on.
i just kinda died for you.
you just kinda stared at me.
we will always have the chance.
we can do this one more time.
hell yeah, i remember aurora.
all this time.
take me now, we can spin the sun around.
and the stars will all come out.
then we will turn and come back down.
you believe theres somewhere else.
where its easier than this.
and you see outside yourself.
and you buy the hole you will fill.
and its on and on.
on and on aurora wait for everyone.
wait till the last ones done.
