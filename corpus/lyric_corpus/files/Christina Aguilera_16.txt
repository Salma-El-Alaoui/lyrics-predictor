once upon a time there was a girl.
in her early years she had to learn.
how to grow up living in a war that she called home.
never knew just where to turn for shelter from the storm.
it hurt me to see the pain across my mothers face.
every time my fathers fists would put her in her place.
hearing all the yelling i would cry up in my room.
hoping it would be over soon.

chorus.
bruises fade father but the pain remains the same.
and i still remember how you kept me so afraid.
strength is my mother for all the love she gave.
and every morning that i wake i look back on yesterday.
and i am ok.

i often wonder why i carry all this guilt.
when its you that helped me put up all these walls i have built.
shadows stir at night through a crack in the door.
the echoes of a broken child screaming please no more.
daddy do not you understand the damage you have done.
for you its just a memory but for me it still lives on.

chorus.
bruises fade father but the pain remains the same.
and i still remember how you kept me so, so afraid.
strength is my mother for all the love she gave.
every morning that i wake i look back on yesterday.

its not so easy to forget, all the marks you left along her neck.
when i was thrown against cold stairs.
and everyday afraid to come home in fear of what i might see, next.

chorus.
bruises fade father but the pain remains the same.
and i still remember how you kept me so afraid.
strength is my mother for all the love you gave.
and every morning that i wake, i look back on yesterday.
and i am ok.
