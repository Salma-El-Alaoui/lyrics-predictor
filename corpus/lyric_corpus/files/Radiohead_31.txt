you can force it but it will not come.
you can taste it but it will not form.
you can crush it but its always here.
you can crush it but its always near.
chasing you home.
saying everything is broken.
everyone is broken.

you can force it but it will stay stone.
you can crush it as dry as a bone.
you can walk it home straight from school.
you can kiss it you can break all the rules.
but still everything is broken.
everyone is broken.
why can not you forget?
