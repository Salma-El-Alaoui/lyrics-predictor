ohh. ohh.

moving, again.
comfort of the chase.
now and again.
this my saving grace.

chorus.
dead on the inside i have got nothing to prove.
keep me alive and give me something to lose.
goodbye, this time.
leaving you.
i have been gone so long, so, gone so long.
but i will come back.
i will come back x7.
for you.

changes, changing.
back and forth again.
trading faces.
strangers in the end.

chorus.
for you x2.

i will come back x8.
for you.
i will come back x5.
