i am buried up to my neck in.
contradictorary flies.
i will take pride as the king of literature.
i am very ape.
and very nice.

if you ever need anything.
please do not.

i am to busy acting like i am not naive.
i have seen it all.
i was here first.

out of the ground.
into the sky.
out of the sky.
into the dirt.
