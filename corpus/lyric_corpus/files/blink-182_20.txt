mom and dad they quite do not.
understand it.
all the kids they laugh as if they planned it.
why do girls want to pierce their nose.
and walk around in torn pantyhose.
oh yeah.

i like the ones who say they listen.
to the punk rock.
i like the kids who fight against how.
they were brought up.
they hate the trends and think its.
fucked to care.
its cool when they piss people off with.
what they wear, oh yeah.

so give me one good reason.
why we need to be like them.
kids will have fun and offend.
they do not want to and do not fit in.

hate the jocks, the preps, the.
hippie fucking scumbags.
heavy metalers with their awful.
pussy hair bands.
counting seconds until we can get away.
ditching school almost every single day.
oh yeah.

so give me one good reason.
why we need to be like them.
kids will have fun and offend.
they do not want to and do not fit in.
