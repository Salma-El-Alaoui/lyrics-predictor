you only see what your eyes want to see.
how can life be what you want it to be.
you are frozen... when your hearts not open.

you are so consumed with how much you get.
you waste your time with hate and regret.
you are broken... when your hearts not open.

mmm... mmm... mmm... if i could melt your heart.
mmm... mmm... mmm... wed never be apart.
mmm... mmm... mmm... give yourself to me.
mmm... mmm... mmm... you... hold... the key.

now theres no point in placing the blame.
and you should know id suffer the same.
if i lose you... my heart will be broken.

love is a bird... she needs to fly.
let all the hurt inside of you die.
you are frozen... when your hearts not open.

mmm... mmm... mmm... if i could melt your heart.
mmm... mmm... mmm... wed never be apart.
mmm... mmm... mmm... give yourself to me.
mmm... mmm... mmm... you... hold... the key.

you only see what your eyes want to see.
how can life be what you want it to be.
you are frozen... when your hearts not open.

mmm... mmm... mmm... if i could melt your heart.
mmm... mmm... mmm... wed never be apart.
mmm... mmm... mmm... give yourself to me.
mmm... mmm... mmm... you... hold... the key.
if i could melt your heart.
mmm... mmm... mmm... wed never be apart.
mmm... mmm... mmm... give yourself to me.
mmm... mmm... mmm... you... hold... the key.
if i could melt your heart.
