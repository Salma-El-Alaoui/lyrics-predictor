do not know much about your life.
do not know much about your world, but.
do not want to be alone tonight.
on this planet they call earth.

you do not know about my past, and.
i do not have a future figured out.
and maybe this is going too fast.
and maybe its not meant to last.

but what do you say to taking chances.
what do you say to jumping off the edge?
never knowing if theres solid ground below.
or hand to hold, or hell to pay.
what do you say.
what do you say?

i just want to start again.
and maybe you could show me how to try.
and maybe you could take me in.
somewhere underneath your skin?

what do you say to taking chances.
what do you say to jumping off the edge?

never knowing if theres solid ground below.
or hand to hold, or hell to pay.
what do you say.
what do you say?

and i had my heart beaten down.
but i always come back for more, yeah.
theres nothing like love to pull you up.
when you are laying down on the floor there.
so talk to me, talk to me.
like lovers do.
yeah, walk with me, walk with me.
like lovers do.
like lovers do.

what do you say to taking chances.
what do you say to jumping off the edge?
never knowing if theres solid ground below.
or hand to hold, or hell to pay.
what do you say.
what do you say?

do not know much about your life.
and i do not know much about your world..
