hell is gone and heavens here.
theres nothing left for you to fear.

little bo peep has lost his sheep.
he popped a pill and fell asleep.
the dew is wet but the grass is sweet my dear.

your mind gets burned.
with the habits you have learned.
but we are the generation thats got to be heard.
you are tired of your teachers and your schools a drag.

so come on let me entertain you.
