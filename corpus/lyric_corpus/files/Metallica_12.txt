 solo .

life it seems, will fade away.
drifting further, everyday.
getting lost, within myself.
nothing matters, no one else.
i have lost the will to live.
simply nothing more to give.
there is nothing more for me.
need the end to set me free.

 solo .

things not what they used to be.
missing one inside of me.
deathly loss, this can not be real.
i cannot stand this hell i feel.
emptiness is filling me.
to the point of agony.
growing darkness, taking dawn.
i was me, but now hes gone.

no one but me.
can save myself.
but its too late.
now i can not think.
think why i should even try.

yesterday seems as though.
it never existed.
death greets me warm.
now i will just say goodbye.
bye.........
