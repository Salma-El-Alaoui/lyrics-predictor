save me from drowning in the sea.
pick me up on the beach.
what a lovely holiday, theres nothing funny left to say.

this sombre song will not drain the sun.
but it will not shine until its sung.
no water running in the stream, the saddest place we have ever seen.

everything i touched was gold.
everything i loved got broken.
on the road to mandalay.

every mistake i have ever made.
has been rehashed and replayed.
as i got lost along the way.

bom bom bom ba da dup bom bom.
bom bom bom ba da dup bom bom.
bom bom bom ba da dup bom bom.
bom badom.

theres nothing left for you to give.
the truth is all that you are left with.
twenty paces then at dawn, we will die and be reborn.

i like to sleep beneath the trees.
have the universe at one with me.
look down the barrel of a gun and feel the moon replace the sun.

everything we have ever stolen.
has been lost, returned or broken.
no more dragons left to slay.

every mistake i have ever made.
has been rehashed and then replayed.
as i got lost along the way.

3x.
bom bom bom ba da dup bom bom.
bom bom bom ba da dup bom bom.
bom bom bom ba da dup bom bom.
bom badom.

save me from drowning in the sea.
pick me up on the beach.
what a lovely holiday, theres nothing funny left to say.
