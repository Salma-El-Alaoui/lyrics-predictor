remember when i dove into the crowd.
and i got a bloody knee under my skin, a mark from wiping out.
it brings back the memories.
every bones been broken.
and my heart is still wide open.

i can not stop.
do not care if i lose.
baby you are the weapon i choose.
these wounds are self inflicted.
i am going down in flames for you.
baby you are the weapon i choose.
these wounds are self inflicted.
one more thing i am addicted too.

with each scar theres a map that tells a story.
what a souvenir of young loves like jumping out.
an airplane riding a tidal wave on an ocean of emotion.
my heart rips me wide open.

i can not stop.
do not care if i lose.
baby you are the weapon i choose.
these wounds are self inflicted.
i am going down in flames for you.
baby you are the weapon i choose.
these wounds are self inflicted.
one more thing i am addicted too.

and i cover up these scars.
we will make it we will make it but we break it.
and i can not stop seeing stars.
lets hope not die.
whenever you are around.
around.

i can not stop.
do not care if i lose.
baby you are the weapon i choose.
these wounds are self inflicted.
i am going down in flames for you.
oohhh you are the weapon i choose.
these wounds are self inflicted.
one more thing i am addicted to.

i can not stop no i can not stop.
no i can not stop.
ohh i am going out in flames.
ohh i am going down in flames.
ohhhh.
baby you are the weapon i choose.
baby you are the weapon i choose....
