i can not imagine how hard it must be to be you.
adopting all your history, its hard being me too.
are your secrets where you left them?
cause now your ghosts are mine as well.
i think its time i met them and i think its time you tell.

and you should have told me when you met me.
all these things i should know.
i should have asked, we should have talked.
about this so long ago.

its not fair, its not fair.
and do not leave me here.
hows this happening to me.
it feels so lonely here.

we are in a mess, a danger zone.
what will happen next, you never know.
we are in a mess, a danger zone.
what will happen next, you never know.

now we share the closet, now you have let me come inside.
and now you are finally undressing, and i feel like i might die.
the damage is infectious, the confession is too late.
and how can i accept this.
how is this happening to me.

its not fair, its not fair.
help me come up for air.
and hows this happening to me.
it feels so lonely here.

we are in a mess, a danger zone.
what will happen next, you never know.
we are in a mess, a danger zone.
what will happen next, you never know.

you never know.
you never know.

all your secrets.
all your lies.
all of it.

we are in a mess, a danger zone.
what will happen next, you never know i am completely paralysed.
we are in a mess, a danger zone i have crashed a thousand times.
what will happen next, you never know its the last haunt.

we are in a mess, a danger zone how do i deserve this.
what will happen next, you never know i do not know whats gonna happen.
we are in a mess, a danger zone how could you do this.
what will happen next, you never know how could this be happening to me.
