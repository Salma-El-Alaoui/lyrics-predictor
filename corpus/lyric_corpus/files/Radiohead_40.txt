where do we go from here?
the words are coming out all weird.
where are you now when i need you?
alone on an aeroplane.
falling asleep against the window pane.
my blood will thicken.

i need to wash myself again.
to hide all the dirt and pain.
cause id be scared.
that theres nothing underneath.
and who are my real friends?
have they all got the bends?
am i really sinking this low?

my babys got the bends.
we do not have any real friends.
i am just lying in a bar with my drip feed on.
talking to my girlfriend waiting for something to happen.
and i wish it was the sixties.
i wish i could be happy.
i wish.
i wish.
i wish that something would happen ...

where do we go from here?
the planet is a gunboat in a sea of fear.
and where are you?
they brought in the cia.
the tanks and the whole marines.
to blow me away.
to blow me sky high.

my babys got the bends.
we do not have any real friends.
i am just lying in a bar with my drip feed on.
talking to my girlfriend waiting for something to happen.
and i wish it was the sixties.
i wish i could be happy.
i wish.
i wish.
i wish that something would happen.

i want to live and breathe.
i want to be part of the human race.
i want to live and breathe.
i want to be part of the human race, race, race.

where do we go from here.
the words are coming out all weird.
where are you now, when i need you.
