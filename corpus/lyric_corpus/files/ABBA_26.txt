you think you are gonna make me softer with your fancy car.
but i can tell you all your tricks aingt gonna get you far.
they say that moneys got a magic touch.
but not to me, it does not mean that much.
you will not have me tonight.
all right, all right, all right, all right.

so long, see you honey.
you can not buy me with your money.
tracy, daisy, they may be crazy.
but i will never be your girl.
so long, see you honey.
you can not buy me with your money.
you know its not worth trying.
so long, so long, so long.

you did not have to send me flowers like you did today.
i would not keep a thing from you, i gave them all away.
the girls might fall for everything you have got.
but i am not one of them, you know i am not.
you will not have me tonight.
all right, all right, all right, all right.

so long, see you honey.
you can not buy me with your money.
tracy, daisy, they may be crazy.
but i will never be your girl.
so long, see you honey.
you can not buy me with your money.
you know its not worth trying.
so long, so long, so long.

so long, see you honey.
you can not buy me with your money.
you know its not worth trying.
so long, so long, so long.
so long, so long, so long.
so long, so long, so long.
