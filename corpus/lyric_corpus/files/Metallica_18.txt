i gotta see you moving fast.
see you come my way.
see the dreams, i hope they last.
never fade away.

gotta see the lights above.
make it loud tonight.
gotta set it all a fire.
set it all a light.

see the flashing lights.
hear the thunder roar.
i am gonna set you all a light.
gotta make it man.
i aingt got a choice.
gotta fill this hall tonight.

helpless.
helpless.
helpless.
helpless.

i do not know what i am gonna do.
maybe not tonight.
gotta set you all a fire.
gotta treat you right.

i can see the flashing lights.
lit before your love.
gotta hear the thunder roar.
coming from above.

see the flashing lights.
hear the thunder roar.
i am gonna set you all a light.
gotta make it man.
i aingt got a choice.
gotta fill this hall tonight.

helpless.
helpless.
helpless.
helpless.

i can see the stars.
but, i can not see whats going on.
every night alone.
i sing my song just for fun.

only time will tell.
if i will make it myself someday.
this stage is mine.
music is my destiny.

cannot squeeze the life from me!
