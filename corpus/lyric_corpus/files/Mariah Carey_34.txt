no i can not forget this evening.
or your face as you were leaving.
but i guess thats just the way the story goes.
you always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows.
yes it shows.

no i can not forget tomorrow.
when i think of all my sorrow.
when i had you there but then i let you go.
and now its only fair that i should let you know.
what you should know.

i can not live.
if living is without you.
i can not live.
i can not give anymore.
i can not live.
if living is without you.
i can not give.
i can not give anymore.

well i can not forget this evening.
nor your face as you were leaving.
but i guess thats just the way the story goes.
you always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows.
yes it shows.

i can not live.
if living is without you.
i can not live.
i can not give anymore.
i can not live.
if living is without you.
i can not live.
i can not give anymore.
no i cant live.
no i cant live.
i cant live.
no i cant live.
no i cant live.
if living is without you.
i cant live without you.
