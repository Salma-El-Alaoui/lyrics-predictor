look at me i am falling.
off a cliff now.
i can still hear my mama yelling no no no.
but the words mean nothing.
ca not catch up to me now.
and the view is so beautiful.
all the way down.
when i was a little boy.
sucking juice from a bottle.
believeing my perceptions were oh so real.
but i did not know nothing.
still know nothing.
was just enough for me to know the way i feel.

this is life.
what a fucked up thing we do.
what a nightmare come true.
or a playground if we choose.
and i choose.

look at me i am swollen.
like a bananafish now.
i am never gonna make it out of my hole.
but i keep on laughing.
does not really matter.
theres dozens of reasons for explaining my soul.
when i was a teenager.
sucking booze with the vatos.
discussing who was gonna live to be 21.
they said they would not make it.
they did not make it.
we are all naked when the day is said and done.

this is life.
what a fucked up thing we do.
what a nightmare come true.
or a playground if we choose.
and i choose.

do not know who made this all come true.
but know while you are here.
you just gotta do what you gotta do.

now if i was not such a weenie.
do you think youd still love me.
prending i am an airplane on the living room floor.
but like a lovely generator.
you stand right by me.
and if words were wisdom id be talking even more.
so i keep on falling.
as i am looking back above me.
watching as my mama just becomes a little dot.
now i am like deniro.
i am amarillo.
and i will never know when i hit the ground.

this is life.
what a fucked up thing we do.
what a nightmare come true.
or a playground if we choose.
and i choose.
