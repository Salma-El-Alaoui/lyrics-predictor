shes taking me places i should never have been.
shes showing me faces i should never have seen.
well these are strange days we are living in today.
cest la vie i say.

i hope i am old before i die.
i hope i live to relive the days gone by.
i hope i am old before i die.
but tonight i am gonna live for today.
so come along for the ride.
i hope i am old before i die.

shes not feeling stable, shes unable to breathe.
her hearts beating faster so i will ask her to leave.
these are strange days we are living in today.
am i straight or gay ?

i hope i am old before i die.
i hope i live to see the day the pope gets high.
i hope i am old before i die.
well tonight i am gonna live for today.
so come along for the ride.
i hope i am old before i die.

well these are strange days we are living in today.
cest la vie i say, i say. i say.

i hope i am old before i die.
i hope i live to relive the days gone by.
i hope i am old before i die.
but tonight i am gonna live for today.
so come along for the ride.
i hope i am old before i die.
i hope i am old before i die.
old before i die.
old before, old before i die and die and die and die.
old before i die.
old before i die.
