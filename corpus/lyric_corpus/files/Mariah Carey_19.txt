i got myself a lover.
who knows what i like.
when he invites me over.
i come every time.
and when my sugar daddy.
takes me for a ride.
whatever way we go its.
delirium time.
hes all mine.
and his loving makes me high.
like a taste of ecstasy.
all i need is him to be my loverboy.
loverboy cmon and love me.
give me more, touch me and touch me.
i enjoy the way you rock me.
all night long.
loverboy cmon and take me.
only you know how to make me.
shudder with anticipation.
all night long.
i got myself a lover.
and hes so sublime.
its quite a bit of heaven.
to feel him inside.
cause when my sugar daddy.
takes me for a ride.
whatever way we go.
its delirium time.
i get weak.
when his candy kisses sweetly.
caress my whole body.
all i need is him to be.
my loverboy.
chorus.
repeat.
