ooh baby.

any time my world gets crazy.

all i have to do to calm it.

is just think of you.



chorus.

its when i think of you, baby.

nothing else seems to matter.

its when i think of you, baby.

all i think about, is our love.



i just get more attatched to you.

when you hold me in your arms.

and squeeze me.

and you leave me making me blue.



repeat chorus.



so in love so in love.

ooh so in love.

with you so in love.

baby so in love.

ooh so in love.

so in love.

with you so in love.



when i think of you when i think of you.

when i think of you when i think of you.



i am so in love.

i just think of you.

when you are not around, i  .

when i think of you.
