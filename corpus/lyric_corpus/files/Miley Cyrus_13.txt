every move i make feels.
lost with no direction.
my faith is shaking.

but i gotta keep trying.
gotta keep my head held high.

always gonna be a uphill battle.
sometimes i am gonna have to lose.

aingt about how fast i get there.
aingt about whats waiting on the other side.
its the climb.

the struggles i am facing.
the chances i am taking.
sometimes might knock me down.
but no, i am not breaking.

i may not know it.

and i, i got to be strong.
just keep pushing on.
