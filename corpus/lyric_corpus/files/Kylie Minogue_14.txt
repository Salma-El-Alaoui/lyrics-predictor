put your hand on your heart and tell me.
that we are through, ooh.
oh, put your hand on your heart.
hand on your heart.

well its one thing to fall in love.
but another to make it last.
i thought that we were just begining.
and now you say we are in the past.
oh, look me in the eye.
and tell me we are really through.

you know its one thing to say you love me.
but another to mean it from the heart.
and if you do not intend to see it through.
why did we ever start.
oh, i wanna hear you tell me.
you do not want my love.

chorus.
put your hand on your heart and tell me.
its all over.
i will not believe it till you.
put your hand on your heart and tell me.
that we are through, ooh.

oh, put your hand on your heart.
hand on your heart.

they like to talk about forever.
but most people never get the chance.
do you wanna lose our love together.
do you find a new romance.
oh, i wanna hear you tell me.
you do not want my love.

chorus x 2.

oh, put your hand on your heart.
hand on your heart.

hand on your heart.
hand on your heart.
hand on your heart.
hand on your heart.

oh, look me in the eye.
and tell me we are really through.

chorus.
repeat  fade.
