deep inside of a parallel.
universe.
its getting harder and harder.
to tell what came first.

under water where thoughts can breathe.
easily.
far away you were made in a sea.
just like me.

christ i am a sidewinder, i am a.
california king.
i swear its everywhere.
its everything.

staring straight up into the sky.
oh my my.
a solar system that fits in your eye.
microcosm.

you could die but you are never dead.
spider web.
take a look at the stars in your head.
fields of space kid.

christ i am a sidewinder, i am a.
california king.
i swear its everywhere.
its everything.

christ i am a sidewinder, i am a.
california king.
i swear its everywhere.
its everything.

psychic changes are born in your heart.
entertain.
a nervous breakthrough that makes us the same.
bless your heart, girl.

kill the pressure its raining on.
salty cheeks.
when you hear the beloved song.
i am with you.

christ i am a sidewinder, i am a.
california king.
i swear its everywhere.
its everything.

christ i am a sidewinder, i am a.
california king.
i swear its everywhere.
its everything.
