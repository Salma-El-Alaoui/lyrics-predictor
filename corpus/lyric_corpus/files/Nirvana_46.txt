we passed upon the stair.
we spoke of was and when.
although i was not there.
he said i was his friend.
which came as a surprise.
i spoke into his eyes.
i thought you died alone.
a long long time ago.

oh no, not me.
we never lost control.
you are face to face.
with the man who sold the world.

i laughed and shook his hand.
and made my way back home.
i searched for form and land.
for years and years i roamed.
i gazed a gazeless stare.
we walked a million hills.
i must have died alone.
a long, long time ago.

who knows?
not me.
i never lost control.
you are face to face.
with the man who sold the world.

who knows?
not me.
we never lost control.
you are face to face.
with the man who sold the world.
