when i was younger i thought the world circled around me.
but in time i realized i was wrong.
my immortal thoughts turned into just dreams of a dead future.
it was a tragic case of my reality.

do you think you are indestructible.
and no one can touch you.
well i think you are disposable.
and its time you knew the truth.
cause its just one of my lies!

why does my life have to be so small?
yet death is forever.
and does forever have a life to call its own?

do not give me an answer cause you.
only know as much as i know.
unless you are been there once.
well i hardly think so.

i used to pray all night.
before i lay myself down.
my mother said it was right.
her mother said it too...
why?
