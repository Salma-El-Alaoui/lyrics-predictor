the whispers in the morning.
of lovers sleeping tight.
are rolling like thunder now.
as i look in your eyes.

i hold on to your body.
and feel each move you make.
your voice is warm and tender.
a love that i could not forsake.

cause i am your lady.
and you are my man.
whenever you reach for me.
i will do all that i can.

lost is how i am feeling lying in your arms.
when the world outsides too.
much to take.
that all ends when i am with you.

even though there may be times.
it seems i am far away.
never wonder where i am.
cause i am always by your side.

cause i am your lady.
and you are my man.
whenever you reach for me.
i will do all that i can.

we are heading for something.
somewhere i have never been.
sometimes i am frightened.
but i am ready to learn.
of the power of love.

the sound of your heart beating.
made it clear.
suddenly the feeling that i can not go on.
is light years away.

cause i am your lady.
and you are my man.
whenever you reach for me.
i am gonna do all that i can.

we are heading for something.
somewhere i have never been.
sometimes i am frightened.
but i am ready to learn.
of the power of love.
the power of love, the power of love.

sometimes i am frightened.
but i am ready to learn.
of the power of love.
the power of love.
ooh, ooh, ooh.
cause i am ready to learn.
of the power of love.
