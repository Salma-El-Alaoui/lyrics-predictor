daniel is travelling tonight on a plane.
i can see the red tail lights heading for spain.
oh and i can see daniel waving goodbye.
god, it looks like daniel, must be the clouds in my eyes.

they say spain is pretty, though i have never been.
well, daniel says its the best place that hes ever seen.
oh, and he should know, hes been there enough.
lord, i miss daniel, oh i miss him so much.

oh, daniel my brother.
you are older than me.
do you still feel the pain.
of the scars that will not heal.
your eyes have died.
but you see more than i.
daniel you are a star.
in the face of the sky.
