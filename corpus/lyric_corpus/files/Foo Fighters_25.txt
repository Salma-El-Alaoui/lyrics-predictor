run and tell all of the angels.
this could take all night.
think i need a devil to help me get things right.
hook me up a new revolution.
cause this one is a lie.
i sat around laughing and watched the last one die.

i am looking to the sky to save me.
looking for a sign of life.
looking for something to help me burn out bright.
i am looking for complication.
looking cause i am tired of lying.
make my way back home when i learn to fly.

i think i am done nursing patience.
it can wait one night.
give it all away if you give me one last try.
we will live happily ever trapped if you just save my life.
run and tell the angels that everythings all right.

i am looking to the sky to save me.
looking for a sign of life.
looking for something to help me burn out bright.
i am looking for a complication.
looking cause i am tired of trying.
make my way back home when i learn to fly.
make my way back home when i learn to.

fly along with me, i can not quite make it alone.
try to make this life my own.
fly along with me, i can not quite make it alone.
