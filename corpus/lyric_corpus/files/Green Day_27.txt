now i rest my head from.
such an endless dreary time.
a time of hopes  happiness.
that had you on my mind.
those days are gone  now it seems.
as if i will get some rest.
but now  then i will see you again.
and if it puts my heart to the test.

so when are all my troubles going to end?
i am understanding now that.
we are only friends.
to this day i am asking why.
i still think about you.

as the days go on i wonder.
will this ever end?
i find it hard to keep control.
when you are with your boyfriend.
i do not mind if all i am is.
just a friend to you.
but all i want to know right now.
is if you think about me too...
