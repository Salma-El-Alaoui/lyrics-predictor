monday morning.
eighteen years dawning.
i said how long.
say how long.

it was one dull morning.
i woke the world with bawling.
i was so sad.
they were so glad.

i had the feeling it was out of control.
i was of the opinion it was out of control.

boys and girls to school.
and girls they make children.
not like this one.

i had the feeling it was out of control.
i was of the opinion it was out of control.

i was of the feeling it was out of control.
i had the opinion it was out of control.

i fought fate.
theres blood at the garden gate.
the man said childhood.
its in his childhood.

one day i will die.
the choice will not be mine.
will it be too late?
you can not fight fate.

i had the feeling it was out of control.
i was of the opinion it was out of control..
