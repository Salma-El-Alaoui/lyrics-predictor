will not you come into my room.
i wanna show you all my wares.
want to see your blood.
want to stand and stare.
see the blood begin to flow.
as it pours upon the floor.
iron maiden can not be fought.
iron maiden can not be sought.

chorus.

oh well, wherever.
wherever you are.
iron maidens gonna get you.
no matter how far.
see the blood flow watching it shed.
up above my head.
iron maiden wants you for dead.

will not you come into my room.
i wanna show you all my wares.
want to see your blood.
want to stand and stare.
see the blood begin to flow.
as it pours upon the floor.
iron maiden can not be fought.
iron maiden can not be sought..
