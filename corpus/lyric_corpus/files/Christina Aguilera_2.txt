do not look at me.
mm, mm.
yeah, eah, oh, ooh.

everyday is so wonderful, and suddenly, its hard to breathe.
now and then i get insecure, from all the pain.
feel so ashamed.

i am beautiful no matter what they say.
words can not bring me down.
i am beautiful in every single way.
yes words can not bring me down, oh no.
so do not you bring me down today.

to all your friends you are delirious.
so consumed in all your doom.
trying hard to fill the emptiness, the piece is gone.
left the puzzle undone, aingt that the way it is?

you are beautiful no matter what they say.
words can not bring you down, no, no.
cause you are beautiful in every single way.
yes words can not bring you down. oh, no.
so do not you bring me down today.

no matter what we do, no matter what we do.
no matter what we say, no matter what we say.
we are the song thats out of tune, yeah full of beautiful mistakes oh yeah.
and everywhere we go, and everywhere we go.
the sun will always shine.
the sun will always, always, shine.
but tomorrow we might awake on the other side.

cause we are beautiful no matter what they say.
yes words will not bring us down, no.
we are beautiful in every single way.
yes words can not bring us down, oh, no.
so do not you bring me down today.

mm, yeah, do not you bring me down today.
yeah, yeah, ooh.
do not you bring me down, ooh, today.
