i walk the lonely streets i watch the people passing by.
i used to smile and say hello. guess i was just a happy guy.
then you happened,girl, this feeling that posessses me.
i just can not move myself. i guess it all just had to be.

chorus.
i can not see nobody...no, i can not see nobody.
mine eyes can only look at you...you.

i used to have a brain i used to think of many things.
i watched the falling rain and listened to the sweet birds sing.
do not ask me why, little girl. i love you and thats all i can say.
you are evry ,evry breath i take.you are my nights my night and day.

chorus...

every single word you hear...is coming from this heart of mine.
i never felt like this before...a love like yours so young and fine.
and now as i try to forget you...it does not work out any way.
i loved you such a long time ago...but in my eyes you will always be.
every single word you hear...is coming from this heart of mine.
i loved you such a long time ago...do not know why...
and i do not know why...baby...

chorus...
