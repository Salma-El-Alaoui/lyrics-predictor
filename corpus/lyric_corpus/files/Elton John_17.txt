levon wears his war wound like a crown.
he calls his child jesus.
cause he likes the name.
and he sends him to the finest school in town.

levon, levon likes his money.
he makes a lot, they say.
spends his days counting.
in the garage by the motorway.

he was born a pauper to a pawn on a christmas day.
when the new york times said god is dead.
and the wars begun.
alvin tostig has a son today.

and he shall be levon.
and he shall be a good man.
and he shall be levon.
in tradition with the family plan.
and he shall be levon.
and he shall be a good man.
he shall be levon.

levon sells cartoon balloons in town.
his family business thrives.
jesus blows up balloons all day.
sits on the porch swing watching them fly.

and jesus, he wants to go to venus.
leaving levon far behind.
take a balloon and go sailing.
while levon, levon slowly dies.

he was born a pauper to a pawn on a christmas day.
when the new york times said god is dead.
and the wars begun.
alvin tostig has a son today.

and he shall be levon.
and he shall be a good man.
and he shall be levon.
in tradition with the family plan, whoo.
and he shall be levon.
and he shall be a good man.
he shall be levon.

and he shall be levon.
and he shall be a good man.
and he shall be levon.
in tradition with the family plan, whoo.
and he shall be levon.
and he shall be a good man.
he shall be levon.
