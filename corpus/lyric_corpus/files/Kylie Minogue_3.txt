down to the disco.
everything stops.
walking in solo.
everyone drops.

hey summer madness.
totally cool.
my heart starts racing.
when i see you.

chorus.
i am burning up baby.
i am burning up.
i am burning up baby.
i am burning up.
i am burning up baby.
i am burning up yeah.
i am burning up baby.
i am burning up yeah.
i am burning up baby.
can you feel it burning me.
i am burning up baby.
can you feel it burning me.
i am burning up baby.
i am burning up yeah.
i am burning up baby.
i am burning up yeah.
i am burning up baby.
can you feel it burning me.
i am burning up baby.
can you feel it burning me.

my pulse is pumping.
my heart may burst.
if you drink me up i am.
gonna quench your thirst.

you are not that honest.
no you are not that nice.
but if i kiss you once i am.
gonna kiss you twice.

chorus.

down to the disco.
everything stops.
walking in solo.
everyone drops.

hey summer madness.
totally cool.
my heart starts racing.
when i see you.
