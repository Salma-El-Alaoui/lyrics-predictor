this song is for lovers out there.
and the little light in the trees.
and all the flowers have gingivitus.
and the birds fly happily.

we are together once again my love.
i need you back, oh baby baby.

i can not explain just why we lost it from the start.
living without you girl, you will only break my heart...

i can feel it, i can hold it.
i can bend it i can shape it, i can mold it.
i can cut it, i can taste it.
i can spank it, beat it, masturbate it.

i been looking for day glo.
always hearing the same ol.
say you want to be faithful.
i can make it do things you would not think it ever could.
