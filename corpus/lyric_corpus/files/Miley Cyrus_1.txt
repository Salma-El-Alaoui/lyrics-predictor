sha, sha, sha, sha.

i probably should not say this.
but at times i get so scared.
when i think about the previous.
relationship we shared.

it was awesome, but we lost it.
its not possible for me, not to care.
and now we are standing in the rain.
but nothings ever gonna change until you hear, my dear.

the 7 things i hate about you.
the 7 things i hate about you, oh you.
you are vain, your games, you are insecure.
you love me, you like her.
you make me laugh, you make me cry.
i do not know which side to buy.
your friends, they are jerks.
when you act like them, just know it hurts.
i wanna be with the one i know.
and the 7th thing i hate the most that you do.
you make me love you.

its awkward and its silent.
as i wait for you to say.
what i need to hear now.
your sincere apology.
when you mean it, i will believe it.
if you text it, i will delete it.
let us be clear.
oh i am not coming back.
you are taking 7 steps here.

the 7 things i hate about you.
you are vain, your games, you are insecure.
you love me, you like her.
you make me laugh, you make me cry.
i do not know which side to buy.
your friends, they are jerks.
when you act like them, just know it hurts.
i wanna be with the one i know.
and the 7th thing i hate the most that you do.
you make me love you.

and compared to all the great things.
that would take too long to write.
i probably should mention.
the 7 that i like.

the 7 things i like about you.
your hair, your eyes, your old levis.
when we kiss i am hypnotized.
you make me laugh, you make me cry.
but i guess thats both i will have to buy.
your hands in mine.
when we are intertwined, everythings alright.
i wanna be with the one i know.
and the 7th thing i like the most that you do.
you make me love you.
you do.
oh
