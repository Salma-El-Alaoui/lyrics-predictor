comparisons are easily done.
once you have had a taste of perfection.
like an apple hanging from a tree.
i picked the ripest one, i still got the seed.

you said move on, where do i go?
i guess second best is all i will know.

cause when i am with him i am thinking of you.
thinking of you, thinking of you.
thinking of you, what you would do.
if you were the one who was spending the night.
spending the night, spending the night.
oh, i wish that i was looking into your eyes.

you are like an indian summer in the middle of winter.
like a hard candy with a surprise center.
how do i get better once i have had the best?
you said theres tons of fish in the water, so the waters i will test.

he kissed my lips, i taste your mouth, oh!
taste your mouth.
he pulled me in, i was disgusted with myself.

cause when i am with him i am thinking of you.
thinking of you, thinking of you.
thinking of you, what you would do.
if you were the one who was spending the night.
spending the night, spending the night.
oh, i wish that i was looking into.

you are the best, and yes, i do regret.
how i could let myself let you go.
now, now the lessons learned.
i touched it, i was burned.
oh, i think you should know!

cause when i am with him i am thinking of you.
thinking of you, thinking of you.
thinking of you, what you would do.
if you were the one who was spending the night.
spending the night, spending the night.
oh, i wish that i was looking into your, your eyes.
looking into your eyes, looking into your eyes.

oh, will not you walk through?
and bust in the door and take me away?
oh, no more mistakes.
cause in your eyes id like to stay, stay...
