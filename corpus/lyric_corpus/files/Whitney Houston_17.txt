how could i throw away a miracle.
how could i face another day.
its all of my doing.
i made a choice.
and today i pay.
my heart is full of pain.
how could you understand.
the way i feel.
how could you relate to so much pain.
seems as though nothing can comfort me.
so today i pray.
that someone should listen for.

chorus.
nothing should matter.
not when love grows inside you.
the choice is yours.
theres a miracle in store.
nothing should matter.
not when love grows inside you.
a voice of love is crying out.
do not throw love away.
theres a miracle in store.

how could i let go of a miracle.
nothing could ever take its place.
thought i was looking.
out for myself.
now it seems the pain.
is all that i have gained.
i wonder if i could be your miracle.
i wonder if i could spare you pain.
seems as though nothing will comfort me.
less today i pray.
that you should come listen for.

chorus.
nothing should matter.
not when love grows inside you.
the choice is yours.
theres a miracle in store.
nothing should matter.
not when love grows inside you.
a voice of love is crying out.
do not throw love away.
theres a miracle in store.

do not ever throw away your miracle.
do not let it slip away.
nothing should matter for.

chorus.
nothing should matter.
not when love grows inside you.
the choice is yours.
theres a miracle in store.
nothing should matter.
not when love grows inside you.
a voice of love is crying out.
do not throw love away.
theres a miracle in store for you.
