pressure.
pushing down on me.
pressing down on you.
no man ask for.
under pressure.
that burns a building down.
splits a family in two.
puts people on streets.

um ba ba be.
um ba ba be.
de day da.
ee day da   thats ok.

its the terror of knowing.
what this world is about.
watching some good friends.
screaming let me out.
pray tomorrow takes me higher.
pressure on people.
people on streets.

day day de mm hm.

chipping around.
kick my brains around the floor.
these are the days it never rains but it pours.

people on streets   ee da de da de.
people on streets   ee da de da de da de da.

its the terror of knowing.
what this world is about.
watching some good friends.
screaming let me out.
pray tomorrow takes me high and high and high.
pressure on people, people on streets.

turned away from it all, like a blind man.
sat on a fence but it do not work.
keep coming up with love.
but its so slashed and torn.
why why why?love love love love.

insanity laughs, under pressure we are cracking.
ca not we give ourselves one more chance.
why can not we give love that one more chance.
why can not we give love, give love, give love, give love, give love, give love, give love, give love.

cause loves such an old fashioned word.
and love dares you to care.
for the people on the edge of the night.
and love dares you to change our way of.
caring about ourselves.

this is our last dance.
this is our last dance.
this is ourselves.
under pressure.
under pressure.
pressure.
