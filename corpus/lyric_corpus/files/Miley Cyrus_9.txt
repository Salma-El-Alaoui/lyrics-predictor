the weekends almost done.
the moon is low in the sky.
i feel like going out.
before the night passes by.
i will not just sit around.
when life becomes a drag...
i dance.

i like the bass.
turn it up, turn it up, turn it up.
i like boom.
turn it up, turn it up, turn it up.
i need guitar.
turn it up, turn it up, turn it up.
i like that drum...
when it goes.

what the weekend.
what the night is all about.
let us dance.
