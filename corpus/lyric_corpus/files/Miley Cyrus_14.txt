everybody needs inspiration.
everybody needs a song.
a beautiful melody.
when the nights are long.

cause there is no guarantee.
that this life is easy.

yea when my world is falling apart.
when theres no light.
to break up the dark.
thats when i.
i look at you.

when the waves are flooding the shore.
and i can not find my way home any more.
thats when i.
i look at you.

when i look at you.
i see forgiveness.
i see the truth.
you love me for who i am.
like the stars hold the moon.
right there where they belong.
and i know i am not alone.

yeah when my world is falling apart.
when theres no light.
to break up the dark.
thats when i.
i look at you.

when the waves are flooding the shore.
and i can not find my way home any more.
thats when i.
i look at you.

you appear just like a dream to me.
just like kaleidoscope colors that cover me.
all i need.
every breath that i breathe.
do not you know you are beautiful.
yeah yeah.

when the waves are flooding the shore.
and i can not find my way home any more.
thats when i.
i look at you.

i look at you.
