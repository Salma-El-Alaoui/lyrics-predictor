what do i do to ignore them behind me?
do i follow my instincts blindly?
do i hide my pride from these bad dreams?
and give in to sad thoughts that are maddening?
do i sit here and try to stand it.
or do i try to catch them red handed?
do i trust some and get fooled by phoniness?
or do i trust none and live life in loneliness?
because i can not hold on when i am stretched so thin.
i make the right moves, but i am lost within.
i put on my daily facade, but then.
i just end up getting hurt again by myself, myself.
i ask why but in my mind, i find.
i can not rely on myself, myself.
i ask why but in my mind, i find.
i can not rely on myself.

i can not hold on to what i want when i am stretched so thin.
its all too much to take in.
i can not hold on to anything, watching everything spin.
with thoughts of failure sinking in.

if i turn my back, i am defenseless.
and to go blindly seems senseless.
if i hide my pride and let it all go on.
then they will take from me until everything is gone.
if i let them go, i will be outdone.
but if i try to catch them, i will be outrun.
if i am killed by the questions like a cancer.
then i will be buried in the silence of the answer by myself, myself.
i ask why but in my mind, i find.
i can not rely on myself, myself.

how do you think i have lost so much?
i am so afraid, i am out of touch.
how do you expect i will know what to do?
when all i know is what you tell me to.

do not you know?
i can not tell you how to make it go.
no matter what i do, how hard i try.
i can not seem to convince myself why.
i am stuck on the outside.
