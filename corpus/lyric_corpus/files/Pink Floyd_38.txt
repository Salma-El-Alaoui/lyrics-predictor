spoken eins, zwei, drei, alle!

ooooh, you cannot reach me now.
ooooh, no matter how you try.
goodbye, cruel world, its over.
walk on by.

sitting in a bunker here behind my wall.
waiting for the worms to come.
in perfect isolation here behind my wall.
waiting for the worms to come.

we are waiting to succeed and going to convene outside brixton.
town hall where we are going to be...

waiting to cut out the deadwood.
waiting to clean up the city.
waiting to follow the worms.
waiting to put on a black shirt.
waiting to weed out the weaklings.
waiting to smash in their windows.
and kick in their doors.
waiting for the final solution.
to strengthen the strain.
waiting to follow the worms.
waiting to turn on the showers.
and fire the ovens.
waiting for the queens and the coons.
and the reds and the jews.
waiting to follow the worms.

would you like to see britannia.
rule again, my friend?
all you have to do is follow the worms.
would you like to send our colored cousins.
home again, my friend?

all you need to do is follow the worms.
