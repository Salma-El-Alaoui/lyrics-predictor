i can not take this situation.
its making me feel so blue.
one moment you walked into my life.
and now you are saying that we are through.

i hear that you are in love now.
babe, i do not know what to say.
i can not believe that i still feel this way.
i hear that you are in love now.
babe, i do not know what to say.
before you decide you will not be mine.
put yourself in my place.

the circle will come around.
you are gonna put yourself.
put yourself.
in my place.
when your lovers bring you down.
and theres no one else around.
you are gonna put yourself.
put yourself.
in my place.

theres no rhyme or reason.
that keeps me playing along.
i guess that i will just keep on believing.
inside you love will know right from wrong.

i hear that you are in love now.
