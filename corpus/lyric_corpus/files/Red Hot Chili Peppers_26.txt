i have got myself.
in a masochistic hold.
why do not you let go.
shake it off.
just to redirect my flow.
come on let us go.

sit up straight.
i am on a double date.
i have got to find my way.
into the light heavy middle weight.
we do not stop rock around the clock.
motor mouthing off.
in front of every other road block.

come again and tell me.
what you are going through.
like a girl who only knew.
her child was due.

memories of everything.
of lemon trees on mercury.
come to me with remedies.
from five or six of seven seas.
you always took me with a smile.
when i was down.
memories of everything.
that blew through.

looking up into.
a reverse vertigo.
what an undertow.
give it up.
another stubborn scorpio.
come on, let us go.

sit up straight.
i am on a double date.
i have got to find my way.
into the light heavy middle weight.
we do not stop rock around the clock.
motor mouthing off.
in front of every other road block.

come again and tell me.
what you are going through.
like a girl who only knew.
her child was due.

to the moon she gave.
another good review.
turn around and look at me.
its really really you.

memories of everything.
of lemon trees on mercury.
come to me with remedies.
from five or six of seven seas.
you always took me with a smile.
when i was down.
memories of everything.
