i do not wanna talk.
about the things we have gone through.
though its hurting me.
now its history.
i have played all my cards.
and thats what you have done too.
nothing more to say.
no more ace to play.

the winner takes it all.
the loser standing small.
beside the victory.
thats her destiny.

i was in your arms.
thinking i belonged there.
i figured it made sense.
building me a fence.
building me a home.
thinking id be strong there.
but i was a fool.
playing by the rules.

the gods may throw a dice.
their minds as cold as ice.
and someone way down here.
loses someone dear.
the winner takes it all.
the loser has to fall.
its simple and its plain.
why should i complain.

but tell me does she kiss.
like i used to kiss you.
does it feel the same.
when she calls your name.
somewhere deep inside.
you must know i miss you.
but what can i say.
rules must be obeyed.

the judges will decide.
the likes of me abide.
spectators of the show.
always staying low.
the game is on again.
a lover or a friend.
a big thing or a small.
the winner takes it all.

i do not wanna talk.
if it makes you feel sad.
and i understand.
you have come to shake my hand.
i apologise.
if it makes you feel bad.
seeing me so tense.
no self confidence.

but you see.
the winner takes it all.
