silence, here i am.
here i am, silent.
bright and clear, its what i am.
i have died.

mother.
mother.
mother.
mother.

death with violence.
excitement right here.
died, go to hell.
here i am right here.

no mas.
no mas.
no mas.
no mas.

death is what i am.
go to hell, go to jail.
in back of that crime.
here i am, take a chance.

dead!
die!
