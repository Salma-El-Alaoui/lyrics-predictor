i have seen your face a thousand times.
have all your stories memorized.
i have kissed your lips a million ways.
but i still love to have you around.

i have held you too many times to count.
i think i know you inside out.
and we are together most days.
but i still love to have you around.

and you are the one i want and its not just a phase.
and you are the one i trust, our love is the real thing.

do not go away.
my love my love.
i want you to stay.
in my life.
do not go away.
my lover my love.
i am happiest when we spend time.

you are a salty water, ocean wave.
you knock me down, you kiss my face.
i know the storms will always come.
but i still love to have you around.

and heaven knows what will come next.
so emotional, you are so complex.
a rollercoaster, built to crash.
but i still love to have you around.

you are the one i want and its not just a phase.
and you are the one i trust, our love is the real thing.

do not go away.
my love my love.
i want you to stay.
in my life.
do not go away.
my lover my love.
i am happiest when we spend time its only you and i.
