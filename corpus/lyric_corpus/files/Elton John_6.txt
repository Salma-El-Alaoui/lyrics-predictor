from the day we arrive on the planet.
and blinking, step into the sun.
theres more to be seen than can ever be seen.
more to do than can ever be done.

some say eat or be eaten.
some say live and let live.
but all are agreed as they join the stampede.
you should never take more than you give.

in the circle of life.
its the wheel of fortune.
its the leap of faith.
its the band of hope.
till we find our place.
on the path unwinding.
in the circle, the circle of life.

some of us fall by the wayside.
and some of us soar to the stars.
and some of us sail through our troubles.
and some have to live with the scars.

theres far too much to take in here.
more to find than can ever be found.
but the sun rolling high through the sapphire sky.
keeps great and small on the endless round.

in the circle of life.
its the wheel of fortune.
its the leap of faith.
its the band of hope.
till we find our place.
on the path unwinding.
in the circle, the circle of life.

its the wheel of fortune.
its the leap of faith.
its the band of hope.
till we find our place.
on the path unwinding.
in the circle, the circle of life.

on the path unwinding.
in the circle, the circle of life.
