so long sad times.
go long bad times.
we are rid of you at last.
howdy gay times.
cloudy gray times.
you are now a thing of the past.

happy days are here again.
the skies above are clear again.
so let us sing a song of cheer again.
happy days are here again.

altogether shout it now.
theres no one.
who can doubt it now.


so let us tell the world about it now.
happy days are here again.

your cares and troubles are gone.
there will be no more from now on.
from now on...

happy days are here again.
the skies above are here again.
so, let us sing a song of cheer again.
happy times.
happy nights.
happy days.
are here again!
