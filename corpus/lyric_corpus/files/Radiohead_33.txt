i can not afford to breathe in this town.
nowhere to sit without a gun in my hand.
hooked back up to the cathode ray.
i am better off dead.
i am better off dead.
i am better off.

prove yourself.
prove yourself.
prove yourself.

i want to breathe, i want to grow.
id say i want it but i do not know how.
i work, i bleed, i beg, i pray.
but i am better off dead.
i am better off dead.
i am better off.

prove yourself.
prove yourself.
prove yourself.

i am better off dead.
i am better off dead.
i am better off.

prove yourself.
prove yourself.
prove yourself.
prove yourself.

woah.
