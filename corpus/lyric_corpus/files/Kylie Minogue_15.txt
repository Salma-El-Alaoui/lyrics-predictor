i do not believe you know me.
though you know my name.
i do not believe the faults i have.
are only mine to blame.
i do not believe that magic.
is only in the mind.
i do not believe id love somebody.
just to pass the time.

but i believe in you.
and i believe in you.

i do not believe that beauty.
will ever be replaced.
i do not believe a masterpiece.
could ever match your face.
the jokers always smiling.
in every hand thats dealt.
i do not believe that when you die.
your presence is not felt.

but i believe in you.
and i believe in you.
but i believe in you.
and i believe in you.

and if you ever had to go away.
nothing in my world could ever be the same.
nothing lasts for ever, but together til the end.
i will give you everything i have again and again.

cause i believe in you, i believe in.
i believe in you, i believe in.
i believe in you, i believe in.
i believe in you, i believe in.

cause i believe in you.
and i believe in you.
but i believe in you.
and i believe in you.

i believe in you, i believe in.
i believe in you, i believe in.
i believe in you, i believe in.
i believe in you, i believe in.

i believe, i believe, i believe in you.....
