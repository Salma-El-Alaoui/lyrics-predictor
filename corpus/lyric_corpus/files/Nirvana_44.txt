monkey see, monkey do   i do not know why.
rather be dead than cool   i do not know why.
every line ends in rhyme   i do not know why.
less is more, love is blind   i do not know why.

stay, stay away.
stay away.
stay away.

give an inch, take a smile   i do not know why.
fashion shits, fashion style   i do not know why.
throw it out and keep it in   i do not know why.
have to have poison skin     i do not know why.

stay, stay away.
stay away.
stay away.
i do not know why, i do not know why.

stay, stay away.
stay away.
stay away.
