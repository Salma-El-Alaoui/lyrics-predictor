i am in the sky tonight.
there i can keep by your side.
watching the wide world riot and hiding out.
i will be coming home next year.

into the sun we climb.
climbing our wings will burn white.
everyone strapped in tight.
we will ride it out.
i will be coming home next year.

come on get on get on.
take it till life runs out.
no one can find us now.
living with our heads underground.

into the night we shine.
lighting the way we glide by.
catch me if i get too high.
when i come down.
i will be coming home next year.

i am in the sky tonight.
there i can keep by your side.
watching the whole world wind around and round.
i will be coming home next year.

come on get on get on.
take it till life runs out.
no one can find us now.
living with our heads underground.

i will be coming home next year.
i will be coming home next year.
everythings alright up here.
if i come down.
i will be coming home next year.

say goodbye, say goodbye, say goodbye, say goodbye.
i will be coming home next year.
i will be coming home next year.
everythings alright up here.
if i come down.
i will be coming home next year.
i will be coming home next year....
