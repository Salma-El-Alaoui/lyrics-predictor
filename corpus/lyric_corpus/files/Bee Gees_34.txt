chorus.
now, i found, that the world is round.
and of course it rains everyday.

living tomorrow, where in the world will i be tomorrow?
how far am i able to see?
or am i needed here?

chorus...

if i remember all of the things i have done.
id remember all of the times i have gone wrong.
why do they keep me here?

chorus...
and chorus...
and chorus...
and chorus....
