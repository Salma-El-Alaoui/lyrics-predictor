laugh and cry.
live and die.
life is a dream we are dreaming.

day by day.
i find my way.
look for the song and the meaning.

then you look at me.
and i always see.
what i have been searching for.
i am lost as can be.
then you look at me.
and i am not lost anymore.

people run.
sun to sun.
caught in their lives ever flowing.
once begun.
life goes till its gone.
we have to go where its going.

chorus.

and you say you see.
when you look at me.
the reason you love life so.
though lost i have been.
i find love again.
and life just keeps on running.
and life just keeps on running.
you look at me and life comes from you.
from...you.
