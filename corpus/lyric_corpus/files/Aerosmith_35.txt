going under rats in the cellar.
going under skings turning yellow.
nose is runny losing my connection.
losing money getting no affection.

new york city blues.
east side west side blues.
throw me in the slam.
catch me if you can.
believe.
that you are wearing.
tearing me apart.

safe complaining cause everythings rotten.
go insaning and aingt a thing forgotten.
feeling cozy rats in the cellar.
cheeks are rosy skings turning yellow.
loose and soggy looking rather lazy.
see my body pushing up the daisies.

new york citys dues.
east side west side news.
throw me in the slam.
a catch me if you can.
believe.
that you are wearing.
tearing me apart.

new york city blues.
east side west side blues.
throw me in the slam.
a catch me if you can.
believe.
that you are wearing.
tearing me apart.
