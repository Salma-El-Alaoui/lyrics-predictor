lying beside you.
here in the dark.
feeling your heartbeat with mine.
softly you whisper.
youre so sincere.
how could our love be so blind?

we sailed on together.
we drifted apart.
and here you are by my side.

so now i come to you.
with open arms.
nothing to hide.
believe what i say.
so here i am.
with open arms.
hoping you will see what your love means to me.
open arms...

living without you.
living alone.
this empty house seems so cold.
wanting to hold you.
wanting you near.
how much i wanted you home.

but now that youve come back.
turned night into day.
i need you to stay.

so now i come to you.
with open arms.
nothing to hide.
believe what i say.
so here i am.
with open arms.
hoping you will see what your love means to me.
open arms....
