do not let your eyes tell the brain.
you should feel ashamed.
everyone needs it baby.
and i feel the same.
did not quite catch your name.
hush, hush, hush.
do not say a thing.
let us see what the night will bring.
it might be everything.

oh it hurts.
when you are too blind to see.
please do not read my mind.
i tell the truth to me.

sin sin sin.
look where we have been.
and where we are tonight.
hate the sin not the sinner.
i am just after a glimmer.
of love and light.
deep inside.

hush hush hush.
to speak is a sin.
and neither of us.
need rescuing.
just relax.
its what jesus would do.
we are made in his image baby.
let us ride this thing through.

oh it hurts.
when you are to blind to see.
what about us.
well it was just for me.

sin sin sin.
look where we have been.
and where we are tonight.
hate the sin not the sinner.
i am just after a glimmer.
of love and light.
deep inside.

i will not sing of amore.
it do not sound sincere.
love is a cliche.
but it fits not here.
i will disappear.

sin sin sin.
look where we have been.
and where we are tonight.
hate the sin not the sinner.
i am just after a glimmer.
of love and light.
deep inside.
deep inside.

its love.
clean sex joy.
i love you.
you love my.
hate how it it feels inside.
feels inside.
feels inside.
