when i pretend everything is what i want it to be.
i look exactly like what you had always wanted to see.
when i pretend i can forget about the criminal i am.
stealing second after second just because i know i can.
but i can not pretend this is the way it will stay.
i am just trying to bend the truth.
i can not pretend i am who you want me to be.
so i am lying my way from you.

no, no turning back now.
i want to be pushed aside, so let me go.
no, no turning back now.
let me take back my life, id rather be all alone.
no, no turning back now.
anywhere on my own because i can see.
no, no turning back now.
the very worst part of you is me.

i remember what they taught to me.
remember condescending talk of who i ought to be.
remember listening to all of that and this again.
so i pretended up a person who was fitting in.
and now you think this person really is me.
and i am trying to bend the truth.
but the more i push, the more i am pulling away.
because i am lying my way from you.

no, no turning back now.
i want to be pushed aside, so let me go.
no, no turning back now.
let me take back my life, id rather be all alone.
no, no turning back now.
anywhere on my own because i can see.
no, no turning back now.
the very worst part of you.
the very worst part of you is me.

this is not what i wanted to be.
i never thought that what i said would have you running from me.
like this.
