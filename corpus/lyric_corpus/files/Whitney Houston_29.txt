i found out what i have been missing.
always on the run.
i have been looking for someone.

now you are here like you have been before.
and you know just what i need.
it took some time for me to see.

chorus.
that you give good love to me baby.
so good, take this heart mine into your hands.
you give good love to me.
never too much.
baby you give good love.

never stopping, i was always searching.
for that perfect love.
the kind that girls like me dream of.

now you are here like you have been before.
and you know just what i need.
it took some time for me to see.

chorus.

now i, i can not stop looking around.
its not, what this loves all about.
our love is here to stay, stay.

chorus.
