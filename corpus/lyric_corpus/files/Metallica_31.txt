sound is ripping through your ears.
the deafening sound of metal nears.
your bodies waiting for his whips.
the taste of leather on your lips.

hear the cry of war.
louder than before.
with his sword in hand.
to control the land.
crushing metal strikes.
on this frightening night.
fall onto your knees.
for the phantom lord.

victims falling under chains.
you hear them crying death pains.
the fists of terrors breaking through.
now theres nothing you can do.

hear the cry of war.
louder than before.
with his sword in ha o.
to control the land.
crushing metal strikes.
on this frightening night.
fall onto your knees.
for the phantom lord.

the leather armies have prevailed.
the phantom lord has never failed.
smoke is lifting from the ground.
the rising volume metal sound.

hear the cry of war.
louder than before.
with his sword in hand.
to control the land.
crushing metal strikes.
on this frightening night.
fall onto your knees.
for the phantom lord.

fall to your knees.
and bow to the phantom lord.
