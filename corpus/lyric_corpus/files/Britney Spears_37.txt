my loneliness aingt killing me no more.

here i go, on my own now.
i do not need nobody, not anybody.

stronger than yesterday.
its nothing but my way.
my loneliness aingt killing me no more.
i am stronger than yesterday.
now its nothing but my way.
my loneliness aingt killing me no more.
but now i am.

stronger than yesterday.
now its nothing but my way.
my loneliness aingt killing me no more.
i am stronger.
