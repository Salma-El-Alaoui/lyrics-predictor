seems like it was yesterday when i saw your face.
you told me how proud you were but i walked away.
if only i knew what i know today.

i would hold you in my arms.
i would take the pain away.
thank you for all you have done.
forgive all your mistakes.
theres nothing i would not do.
to hear your voice again.
sometimes i want to call you.
but i know you will not be there.

i am sorry for blaming you.
for everything i just could not do.
and i have hurt myself by hurting you.

some days i feel broke inside but i will not admit.
sometimes i just want to hide cause its you i miss.
and its so hard to say goodbye when it comes to this.

would you tell me i was wrong?
would you help me understand?
are you looking down upon me?
are you proud of who i am?
theres nothing i would not do.
to have just one more chance.
to look into your eyes.
and see you looking back.

i am sorry for blaming you.
for everything i just could not do.
and i have hurt myself.

if i had just one more day.
i would tell you how much that i have missed you since you have been away.
oh, its dangerous.
its so i am afraid to try to turn back time.

i am sorry for blaming you for everything i just could not do.
and i have hurt myself.
by hurting you.
