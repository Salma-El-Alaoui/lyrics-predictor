if you start me up.

if you start me up.
if you start me up i will never stop.
i have been running hot.

if you start me up.
if you start me up i will never stop, never stop, never stop, never stop.

you make a grown man cry.
you make a grown man cry.
you make a grown man cry.
spread out the oil, the gasoline.
i walk in smooth, ride in a mean, mean machine.
start it up.

if you start it up.
kick on the starter give it all you got, you got, you got.
i can not compete with the riders in the other heats.
if you rough it up.
if you like it you can slide it up, slide it up, slide it up, slide it up.

do not make a grown man cry.
do not make a grown man cry.
do not make a grown man cry.
my eyes dilate, my lips go green.
my hands are greasy.

slide it up.

you make a grown man cry.
you make a grown man cry.
you make a grown man cry.
ride like the wind at double speed.
i will take you places that you have never, never seen.

start it up.
love the day when we will never stop, never stop.
never, never, never stop.
tough me up.
never stop, never stop.

you, you, you make a grown man cry.
you, you make a dead man cum.
you, you, you make a dead man cum.
