1, 2, 1, 2, 3.

there is a park that is known.
4 the face it attracts.
colorful people whose hair.
on 1 side is swept back.
the smile on their faces.
it speaks of profound inner peace.
ask where they are going.
they will tell u nowhere.
they have taken a lifetime lease.
on paisley park.

chorus.
the girl on the seesaw is laughing.
4 love is the color.
this place imparts paisley park.
admission is easy, just say u.
believe and come 2 this.
place in your heart.
paisley park is in your heart.

there is a woman who sits.
all alone by the pier.
her husband was naughty.
and caused his wife so many tears.
he died without knowing forgiveness.
and now she is sad, so sad.
maybe she will come 2 the park.
and forgive him.
and life will not be so bad.
in paisley park.

chorus.

see the man cry as the city.
condemns where he lives.
memories die but taxes.
he will still have 2 give.
who whoever said that elephants.
were stronger than mules?
come 2 the park.
and play with us.
there are not any rules.
in paisley park.

chorus repeated 2 times.

your heart, your heart.
paisley park.
your heart, your heart, your heart sing, sing it.
paisley park.
paisley park.
paisley park.
