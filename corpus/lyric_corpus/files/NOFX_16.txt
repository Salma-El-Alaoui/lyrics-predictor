lori meyers used to live upstairs.
our parents had been friends for years.
almost every afternoon wed play forbidden games.
at nine years old theres no such thing as shame.
it was not recognition of her face, what.
brought me back was a familiar mark.
as it flashed across the screen. i.
bought some magazines, some video taped scenes.
incriminating act i felt that i could save her.
who are you to tell me how to live my life?
you think i sell my body, i merely sell my time.
i aingt no cinderella, i aingt waiting for no prince.
to save me in fact until just now i was doing just fine.
and on and on.
i know what degradation feels like.
i felt it on the floor at the factory.
where i worked long before, i took control.
now i answer to me.
the 50k i make this year will go anywhere i please.
wheres the problem?
