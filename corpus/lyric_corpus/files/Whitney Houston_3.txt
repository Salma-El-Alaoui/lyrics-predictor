remember when we held on in the rain.
the nights we almost lost it once again.
we can take the night into tomorrow.
living on feelings.
touching you i feel it all again.

did not we almost have it all.
when love was all we had worth giving.
the ride with you was worth the fall my friend.
loving you makes life worth living.
did not we almost have it all.
the nights we held on till the morning.
you know you will never love that way again.
did not we almost have it all.

the way you used to touch me felt so fine.
we kept our hearts together down the line.
a moment in the soul can last forever.
comfort and keep us.
help me bring the feeling back again.

did not we almost have it all.
when love was all we had worth giving.
the ride with you was worth the fall my friend.
loving you makes life worth living.
did not we almost have it all.
the nights we held on till the morning.
you know you will never love that way again.
did not we almost have it all.

did not we have the best of times.
when love was young and new.
could not we reach inside and find.
the world of me and you.
we will never lose it again.
cause once you know what love is.
you will never let it end.

did not we almost have it all.
when love was all we had worth giving.
the ride with you was worth the fall my friend.
loving you makes life worth living.
did not we almost have it all.
the nights we held on till the morning.
you know you will never love that way again.
did not we almost have it all.

did not we almost have it all.
