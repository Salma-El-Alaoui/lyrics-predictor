verse.
zephyr in the sky at night i wonder.
do my tears of mourning sink beneath the sun.
shes got herself a universe gone quickly.
for the call of thunder threatens everyone.

chorus.

and i feel like i just got home.
and i feel.
and i feel like i just got home.
and i feel.

faster than the speeding light shes flying.
trying to remember where it all began.
shes got herself a little piece of heaven.
waiting for the time when earth shall be as one.

chorus.

quicker than a ray of light.
quicker than a ray of light.
quicker than a ray of light.

verse.

and i feel.
quicker than a ray of light.
then gone for.
someone else shall be there.
through the endless years.

shes got herself a universe.
shes got herself a universe.
shes got herself a universe.

and i feel.
and i feel.
and i feel like i just got home.
and i feel.

quicker than a ray of light shes flying.
quicker than a ray of light i am flying.
