where does your garden grow?
tell me the secrets that you know.
another time, another place.
where are the holy ones?
selling the secret to the sun.
welcome to the universe.

cross the line.
redefine.
lose your mind.
come crawl inside.

hey, hey.
what have you got?
does not matter to me cause i do not want them.
i am not the only one.

the unified divide.
among and then deny.
now could you kindly cut to the chase?
its like some other song.
pretty but somethings always wrong.
show me the secret ancient sign.

cross the line.
redefine.
lose your mind.
come crawl inside.

hey, hey.
what have you got?
does not matter to me cause i do not want them.
i am not the only one.

hey, hey.
what have you got?
does not matter to me cause i do not want them.
i am not the only one.

see.
its in your eyes.
come break me down.
come break me.

hey, hey.
what have you got?
does not matter to me cause i do not want them.
i am not the only one.

hey, hey.
what have you got?
does not matter to me cause i do not want them.
i am not the only one.

hey.
