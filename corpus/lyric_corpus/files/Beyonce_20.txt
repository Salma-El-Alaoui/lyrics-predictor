i wish i could believe you,then id be alright.
but now everything you told me really do not apply.
to the way i feel inside,loving you was easy once upon a time.
but now my suspicions of you have multiplied.
and its all because you lied,i only give you a hard time, cause i cant go on and pretend like, i have not tried to forget this.
but i am much too full of resentment.
just can not seem to get over the way you hurt me i dont know how you gave another who did not mean a thing the very thing you gave to me i thought i could forgive you and i know you have changed as much as i wanna trust you i know it aingt the same and its all because you lied i only give you a hard time, cause i cant go on and pretend like, i have not tried to forget this.
but i am much too full of resentment.
i will always remember feeling like i was no good like i could do it for you like no mistress could and its all because you lied i only give you a hard time, cause i cant go on and pretend like, i have not tried to forget this.
but i am too damn full of resentment.
i know she was attractive but i was here first.
i been riding with you for 6 years.
why did i deserve to be treated this way by you i know you prolly thinking.
whats up wit b i been crying too long what did you do to me i use to be so strong now you took my soul and i am crying can not stop crying can not stop crying.
you could have told me you was not happy i know you did not wanna hurt me but look what you done , done to me now.
i gotta look at her in her eyes and see shes had half of me.
how could you lie.
