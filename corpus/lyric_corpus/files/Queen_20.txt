fear me, you lords and lady preachers.
i descend upon your earth from the skies.
i command your very souls, you unbelievers.
bring before me what is mine.
the seven seas of rhye.

can you hear me, you peers and privy councilors.
i stand before you naked to the eyes.
i will destroy any man who dares abuse my trust.
i swear that you will be mine.
the seven seas of rhye.

sister i live and lie for you.
mister do and i will die.
you are mine, i possess you.
belong to you forever ever, ever, ahh.

storm the master marathon i will fly through.
by flash and thunder fire i will survive.
i will survive, i will survive then i will defy the laws of nature.
and come out alive.
then i will get you.

begone with you you shod and shady senators.
give out the good, leave out the bad evil cries.
i challenge the mighty titan and his troubadours.
and with a smile.
i will take you to the seven seas of rhye.

id like to be beside the seaside.
id like to be beside the sea.
where the brass drums play.
id like to be beside the seaside.
id like to be beside the sea.
