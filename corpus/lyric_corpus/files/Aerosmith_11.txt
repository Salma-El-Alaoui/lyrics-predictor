checkmate honey, beat you at your own damn game.
no dice honey, i am living on the astral plane.
feets on the ground, and your heads going down the drain.
oh, heads i win, tails you lose, to the never mind.
where to draw the line.

an indian summer, carrie was all over the floor.
she was a wet net winner, and rarely ever left the store.
shed sing and dance all night, and wrong all the right out of me.
oh, pass me the vile and cross your fingers, it do not take time.
nowhere to draw the line.

hi ho silver, we were singing all your cowboy songs.
oh, you told carrie, and promised her you would not be long.
heads i win, tails you lose, lord its such a crime.
no dice honey, you the salt, you are the queen of the brine.
checkmate honey, you are the only one whos got to choose.
where to draw the line.

checkmate.
do not be late.
take another pull.
thats right.
impossible.
when you got to be yourself.
you are the boss.
the toss.
the dice.
the price.
grab yourself a slice.
nowhere to draw the line.
