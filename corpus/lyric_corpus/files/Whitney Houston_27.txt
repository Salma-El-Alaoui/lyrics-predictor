mommies and daddies, always believe.
that their little angels are special indeed.
and you could grow up to be anything.
but who would imagine a king.

a sheperd or teacher, is what you could be.
or maybe a fisherman out on the sea.
or maybe a carpenter, building things.
but who would imagine a king.

it was so clear, when the wisemen arrived.
and the angels were singing your name.
that the world would be different.
cause you were alive.
thats why heaven stood still to proclaim.

one day an angel, said quietly.
that soon he would bring something special to me.
and of all of the wonderful gifts he could bring.
who would imagine, who could imagine, who would imagine a king.

ooooooooooooo.
mommy.
