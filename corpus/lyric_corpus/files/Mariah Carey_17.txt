once again we sit in silence.
after all is said and done.
only emptiness inside us.
baby, look what we have become.
we can make a million promises.
but we still will not change.
it is not right to stay together.
when we only bring each other pain.

chorus.
i do not wanna cry.
do not wanna cry.
nothing in the world.
could take us back.
to where we used to be.
though i have given you my heart and soul.
i must find a way of letting go.
cause baby, i do not wanna cry.

too far apart to bridge the distance.
but something keeps us hanging on and on.
pretending not to know the difference.
denying what we had is gone.
every moment we are together.
its just breaking me down.
i know we swore it was forever.
but it hurts too much to stay around.

chorus.

all the magics gone.
theres just a shadow of a memory.
something just went wrong.
we can not go on make believing.

chorus.
