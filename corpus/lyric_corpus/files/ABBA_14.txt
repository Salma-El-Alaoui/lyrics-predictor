i have a dream.
a song to sing.
to help me cope.
with anything.
if you see the wonder.
of a fairy tale.
you can take the future.
even if you fail.

i believe in angels.
something good in everything i see.
i believe in angels.
when i know the time is right for me.
i will cross the stream.
i have a dream.

i have a dream.
a fantasy.
to help me through.
reality.
and my destination.
makes it worth the while.
pushing through the darkness.
still another mile.

i believe in angels.
something good in everything i see.
i believe in angels.
when i know the time is right for me.
i will cross the stream.
i have a dream.

i will cross the stream.
i have a dream.
