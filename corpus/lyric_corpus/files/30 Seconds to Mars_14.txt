into the night.
desperate and broken.
the sound of a fight.
father has spoken.

we were the kings and queens of promise.
we were the victims of ourselves.
maybe the children of a lesser god.
between heaven and hell, heaven and hell.

into your eyes.
hopeless and taken.
we stole our new lives.
through blood an pain.
in defense of our dreams.
in defense of our dreams.

we were the kings and queens of promise.
we were the victims of ourselves.
maybe the children of a lesser god.
between heaven and hell, heaven and hell.

the age of man is over.
the darkness comes and all.
these lessons that we have learned here.
have only just begun.

we were the kings and queens of promise.
we were the victims of ourselves.
maybe the children of a lesser god.
between heaven and hell.

we are the kings.
we are the queens.
we are the kings.
we are the queens.
