i used to be a rolling stone.
you know if the cause was right.
id leave to find the answer on the road.
i used to be a heart beating for someone.
but the times have changed.
the less i say the more my work gets done.

cause i live and breathe this philadelphia freedom.
from the day that i was born i have waved the flag.
philadelphia freedom took me knee high to a man.
gave me peace of mind my daddy never had.

oh philadelphia freedom shine on me, i love you.
shine a light through the eyes of the ones left behind.
shine a light shine a light.
shine a light will not you shine a light.
philadelphia freedom i love you, yes i do.

if you choose to you can live your life alone.
some people choose the city.
some other choose the good old family home.
i like living easy without family ties.
till the whipporwill of freedom zapped me.
right between the eyes.

cause i live and breathe this philadelphia freedom.
from the day that i was born i have waved the flag.
philadelphia freedom took me knee high to a man.
gave me peace of mind my daddy never had.

oh philadelphia freedom shine on me, i love you.
shine a light through the eyes of the ones left behind.
shine a light shine a light.
shine a light will not you shine a light.
philadelphia freedom i love you, yes i do.
