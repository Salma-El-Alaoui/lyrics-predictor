here now, do not make a sound.
say, have you heard the news today?
one flag was taken down.
to raise another in its place.

a heavy cross you bear.
a stubborn heart remains unchanged.
no harm, no life, no love.
no stranger singing in your name.

but maybe the season.
the colors change in the valley skies.
dear god, i have sealed my fate.
running through hell, heaven can wait.

long road to ruin there in your eyes.
under the cold streetlights.
no tomorrow, no dead end in sight.

let us say we take this town.
no king or queen of any state.
get up to shut it down.
open the streets and raise the gates.

i know a wall to scale.
i know a field without a name.
head on without a care.
before its way too late.

maybe the season.
the colors change in the valley skies.
oh god, i have sealed my fate.
running through hell, heaven can wait.

long road to ruin there in your eyes.
under the cold streetlights.
no tomorrow, no dead end.

long road to ruin there in your eyes.
under the cold streetlights.
no tomorrow, no dead end in sight.

for every piece to fall in place.
forever gone without a trace.
your horizon takes its shape.
no turning back, do not turn that page.

come now, i am leaving here tonight.
come now, let us leave it all behind.
is that the price you pay.
running through hell, heaven can wait.

long road to ruin there in your eyes.
under the cold streetlights.
no tomorrow, no dead ends.

long road to ruin there in your eyes.
under the cold streetlights.
no tomorrow, no dead ends.

long road to ruin there in your eyes.
under the cold streetlights.
no tomorrow, no dead end in sight.
