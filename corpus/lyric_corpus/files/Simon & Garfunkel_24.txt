gee but its great to be back home.
home is where i want to be.
i have been on the road so long my friend.
and if you came along.
i know you could not disagree.

chorus.
its the same old story.
everywhere i go.
i get slandered.
libeled.
i hear words i never heard.
in the bible.
and i am one step ahead of the shoe shine.
two steps away from the county line.
just trying to keep my customers satisfied.
satisfied.

deputy sheriff said to me.
tell me what you come here for, boy.
you better get your bags and flee.
you are in trouble boy.
and now you are heading into more.

chorus.
