we are living in repetition.
content in the same old shtick again.
now the routines turning to contention.
like a production line going over and over and over.
roller coaster.

now i cannot speak, i lost my voice.
i am speechless and redundant.
cause i love you is not enough.
i am lost for words.

choreographed and lack of passion.
prototypes of what we were.
went full circle til i am nauseous.
taken for granted now.
now i waste it, i faked it, i ate it, now i hate it.

cause i cannot speak, i lost my voice.
i am speechless and redundant.
cause i love you is not enough.
i am lost for words, now i cannot speak.

now i cannot speak, i lost my voice.
i am speechless and redundant.
cause i love you is not enough.
i am lost for words.

now i cannot speak, i lost my voice.
i am speechless and redundant.
cause i love you is not enough.
i am lost for words.
