i have been in this town so long that back in the city.
i have been taken for lost and gone.
and unknown for a long long time.

fell in love years ago.
with an innocent girl.
from the spanish and indian home.
home of the heroes and villains.

once at night catillian squared the fight.
and she was right in the rain of the bullets that eventually brought her down.
but shes still dancing in the night.
unafraid of what a dude will do in a town full of heroes and villains.

heroes and villains.
just see what you have done.

heroes and villains.
just see what you have done.

stand or fall i know there.
shall be peace in the valley.
and its all an affair.
of my life with the heroes and villains.

my children were raised.
you know they suddenly rise.
they started slow long ago.
head to toe healthy weathy and wise.

i have been in this town so long.
so long to the city.
i am fit with the stuff.
to ride in the rough.
and sunny down snuff i am alright.
by the heroes and.

heroes and villains.
just see what you have done.

heroes and villains.
just see what you have done.
