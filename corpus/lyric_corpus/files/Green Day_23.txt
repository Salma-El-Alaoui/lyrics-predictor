i sit around and watch the tube, but nothings on.
i change the channels for an hour or two.
twiddle my thumbs just for a bit.
i am sick of all the same old shit.
in a house with unlocked doors.
and i am fucking lazy.

bite my lip and close my eyes.
take me away to paradise.
i am so damn bored i am going blind.
and i smell like shit.

peel me off this velcro seat and get me moving.
i sure as hell can not do it by myself.
i am feeling like a dog in heat.
barred indoors from the summer street.
i locked the door to my own cell.
and i lost the key.

bite my lip and close my eyes.
take me away to paradise.
i am so damn bored i am going blind.
and i smell like shit.

i got no motiviation.
where is my motiviation?
no time for no motiviation.
smoking my inspiration.

sit around and watch the phone, but no ones calling.
call me pathetic, call me what you will.
my mother says to get a job.
but she do not like the one shes got.
when masturbations lost its fun.
you are fucking lonely.

bite my lip and close my eyes.
take me away to paradise.
i am so damn bored.
i am going blind.
and loneliness has to suffice.
bite my lip and close my eyes.
i am slipping away to paradise.
some say, quit or i will go blind.
but its just a myth.
