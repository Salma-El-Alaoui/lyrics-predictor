spanish songs in andalucia.
the shooting sites in the days of 39.
oh please leave the ventana open.
federico lorca is dead and gone.
bullet holes in the cemetery walls.
the black cars of guardia civil.
spanish bombs on the costa rica.
i am flying in on a dc 10 tonight.

spanish bombs, yo te quiero a finito.
yo te quiero, oh mi corazn.
spanish bombs, yo te quiero a finito.
yo te quiero, oh mi corazn.

spanish weeks in my disco casino.
the freedom fighters died up on the hill.
they sang the red flag.
they wore the black one.
after they died it was mockingbird hill.
back home the buses went up in flashes.
the irish tomb drenched in blood.
spanish bombs shatter the hotels.
my seoritas rose was nipped in the bud.

spanish bombs, yo te quiero a finito.
yo te quiero, oh mi corazn.
spanish bombs, yo te quiero a finito.
yo te quiero, oh mi corazn.

the hillsides ring with free the people.
or can i hear the echoes from the days of 39.
trenches full of poets, a ragged army.
fixing bayonets to fight the other line.
spanish bombs rock the province.
i am hearing music from another time.
spanish bombs, costa brava.
i am flying in on a dc 10 tonight.

spanish bombs, yo te quiero a finito.
yo te quiero, oh mi corazn.
spanish bombs, yo te quiero a finito.
yo te quiero, oh mi corazn.
oh mi corazn.
oh mi corazn.

spanish songs in andaluca, mandolina.
oh mi corazn.
spanish songs in granada.
oh mi corazn.
oh mi corazn.
oh mi corazn.
