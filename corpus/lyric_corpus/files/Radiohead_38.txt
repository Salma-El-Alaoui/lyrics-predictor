the breath of the morning.
i keep forgetting.
the smell of the warm summer air.

i live in a town.
where you can not smell a thing.
you watch your feet.
for cracks in the pavement.

up above.
aliens hover.
making home movies.
for the folks back home.

of all these weird creatures.
who lock up their spirits.
drill holes in themselves.
and live for their secrets.

they are all uptight.
uptight ...
uptight ...
uptight ...
uptight ...
uptight ...
uptight ...
uptight ...

i wish that theyd swoop down in a country lane.
late at night when i am driving.
take me on board their beautiful ship.
show me the world as id love to see it.

id tell all my friends.
but theyd never believe me.
theyd think that id finally lost it completely.

id show them the stars.
and the meaning of life.
theyd shut me away.
but id be all right.
all right.
i am all right.

i am just uptight.
uptight ...
uptight ...
uptight ...
uptight ...
uptight ...
uptight ...
uptight ....
