the only place where you can dream.
living here is not what it seems.
ship of white light in the sky.
nobody there to reason why.

here i am, i am not really there.
smiling faces ever so rare.
let us walk in deepest space.
living here just is not the place.

repeat.

leaves of green grasses twine.
girls driking plasma wine.
look at love and dream unfolds.
living here you will never grow old.

stalks of light grow from the ground.
when i cry there is not a sound.
all my feelings cannot be held.
i am happy in my new strange world.
