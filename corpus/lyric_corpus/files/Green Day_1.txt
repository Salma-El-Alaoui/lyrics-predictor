i sit alone in my bedroom.
staring at the walls.
i have been up all damn night long.
my pulse is speeding.
my love is yearning.

i hold my breath and close my eyes.
and dream about her.
cause shes 2000 light years away.
she holds my malakite so tight so..
never let go.
cause shes 2000 light years away.

i sit outside and watch the sunrise.
look out as far as i can.
i can not see her, but in the distance.
i hear some laughter.
we laugh together.

then i hold my breath and close my eyes.
and dream about her.
cause shes 2000 light years away..
