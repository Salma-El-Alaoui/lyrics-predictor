i know i am pathetic, i knew when she said it.
a loser, a bums what she called me when i drove her home.
theres no more waiting and sure no more wasting.
i have done all i can but she still wants to be left alone.

you got, you got, you got to help me out.
and i will try not to argue.
no one, no one, no one likes a drop out.
mistakes are hard to undo.

do not pull me down, this is where i belong.
i think i am different, but i am the same and i am wrong.
do not pull me down, this is where i belong.
i think i am different, this is where i belong.

i think its disgusting, believing and trusting.
if i gave a fuck there would be nothing for me to prove.
although its amusing, its slightly confusing.
i have done all i can but her ego is still hard to move.
