its another lonely evening.
and another lonely town.
but i aingt too young to worry.
and i aingt too old to cry.
when a woman gets me down.
got another empty bottle.
and another empty bed.
aingt too young to admit it.
and i am not too old to lie.
i am just another empty head.

thats why i am lonely.
i am so lonely.
but i know what i am gonna do  .

i am gonna ride on ride on.
ride on, standing on the edge of the road.
ride on, thumb in the air.
ride on, one of these days i am gonna.
ride on, change my evil ways.
till then i will just keep riding on.

broke another promise.
and i broke another heart.
but i aingt too young to realize.
that i aingt too old to try.
try to get back to the start.
and its another red light nightmare.
another red light street.
and i aingt too old to hurry.
cause i aingt too old to die.
but i sure am hard to beat.

but i am lonely.
lord i am lonely.
what am i gonna do  .

ride on.
ride on, got myself a one way ticket.
ride on.
ride on, going the wrong way.
ride on, gonna change my evil ways.
ride on, one of these days.
one of these days.

ride on.
ride on.
i am gonna ride on.
ride on, looking for a truck.
ride on.
ride on, keep on riding.
riding on and on and on.
