hey lady.
you got the love i need.
maybe more than enough.
oh, darling, darling, darling.
walk a while with me.
ohh, you have got so much.
so much.
so much.

many have i loved.
many times been bitten.
many times i have gazed along the open road.

many times i have lied.
and many times i have listened.
many times i have wondered how much there is to know.

many dreams come true.
and some have silver linings.
i live for my dream and a pocketful of gold.

mellow is the man.
who knows what hes been missing.
many many men can not see the open road.

many is a word that only leaves you guessing.
guessing bout a thing you really ought to know, ohh ohh ohh ohh.
really ought to know, ohh ohh.
i really ought to know.
