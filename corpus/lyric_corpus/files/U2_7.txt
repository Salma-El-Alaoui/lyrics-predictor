in the howling wind.
comes a stinging rain.
see it driving nails.
into the souls on the tree of pain.

from the firefly.
a red orange glow.
see the face of fear.
running scared in the valley below.

bullet the blue sky.
bullet the blue sky.
bullet the blue.
bullet the blue.

in the locust wind.
comes a rattle and hum.
jacob wrestled the angel.
and the angel was overcome.

you plant a demon seed.
you raise a flower of fire.
we see them burning crosses.
see the flames, higher and higher.

woh, woh, bullet the blue sky.
bullet the blue sky.
bullet the blue.
bullet the blue.

suit and tie comes up to me.
his face red like a rose on a thorn bush.
like all the colours of a royal flush.
and hes peeling off those dollar bills.
slapping em down.
one hundred, two hundred.

and i can see those fighter planes.
and i can see those fighter planes.
across the tin huts as children sleep.
through the alleys of a quiet city street.
up the staircase to the first floor.
we turn the key and slowly unlock the door.
as a man breathes into his saxophone.
and through the walls you hear the city groan.
outside, is america.
outside, is america.
america.

see across the field.
see the sky ripped open.
see the rain coming through the gaping wound.
howling the women and children.
who run into the arms.
of america..
