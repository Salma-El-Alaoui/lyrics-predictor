this is a sound.
the here and the now.
you have got to talk to talk to talk to talk.
to get it all out.
i listen, i listen, i listen.
but you are out of tune.
you are so out of tune!

this is the last song this is the last song.
this is the last song that i will dedicate to you.

something i found.
yeah, while i am still around.
you got to walk to walk to walk to walk.
to make any ground.
you will push in, you will push in, you will push in.
but there aingt no room.
no, there aingt no room!

this is the last song this is the last song.
this is the last song this is the last song.
that i will dedicate to you.
made my peace and now i am through.
this is the last song that i will dedicate to you.

and yours is a name.
i will never, name again.
i will never name again.
we pretend.
it does not matter.
we pretend it all away, we pretend it all away.
we pretend, we pretend, we pretend.
but it aingt no use.

this is the last song this is the last song.
this is the last song this is the last song.
that i will dedicate to you.
made my peace and now i am through.
this is the last song that i will dedicate to you.
..to you, to you..
