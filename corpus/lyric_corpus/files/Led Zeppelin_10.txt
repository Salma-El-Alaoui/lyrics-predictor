let me take you to the movies. can i take you to the show.
let me be yours ever truly. can i make your garden grow.

from the houses of the holy, we can watch the white doves go.
from the door comes satans daughter, and it only goes to show. you know.

theres an angel on my shoulder, in my hand a sword of gold.
let me wander in your garden. and the seeds of love i will sow. you know.

so the world is spinning faster. are you dizzy when you are stoned.
let the music be your master. will you heed the masters call.
oh... satan and man.

said there aingt no use in crying. cause it will only, only drive you mad.
does it hurt to hear them lying? was this the only world you had? oh oh.

so let me take you, take you to the movie. can i take you, baby, to the show.
why do not you let me be yours ever truly. can i make your garden grow.
you know..
