lately i am getting better.
wish i could stay sick with you.
but theres too many egos left to bruise.
call it sin, you can call it whatever.
eating deep inside of you.
well if it were me its all id ever do.
steal me now and forever.
i will steal something good for you.
the criminal in me is no one new.
till you find something better.
when theres nothing left to use.
and everything starts going down on you.
i am the generator, firing whenever you quit.
yeah whatever it is, you go out and its on.
yeah can not you hear my motored heart.
you are the one that started it.
send me out on a tether.
swing it round i will spin your noose.
you let it down.
i will hang around with you, till you find someone better.
when theres no one left to use, and everyone keeps going down.
