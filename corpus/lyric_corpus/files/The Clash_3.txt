my daddy was a bankrobber.
but he never hurt nobody.
he just loved to live that way.
and he loved to steal your money.

some is rich, and some is poor.
thats the way the world is.
but i do not believe in lying back.
saying how bad your luck is.

so we came to jazz it up.
we never loved a shovel.
break your back to earn your pay.
an do not forget to grovel.

the old man spoke up in a bar.
said i never been in prison.
a lifetime serving one machine.
is ten times worse than prison.

imagine if all the boys in jail.
could get out now together.
whadda you think theyd want to say to us?
while we was being clever.

someday you will meet your rocking chair.
cos thats where we are spinning.
theres no point to wanna comb your hair.
when its grey and thinning.

run rabbit run.
strike out boys, for the hills.
i can find that hole in the wall.
and i know that they never will.
