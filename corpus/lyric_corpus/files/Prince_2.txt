its only been a hour since you left me.
but it feels like a million days.
if i had a magic wand i could turn back time.
id never let you go away.

i did not have the heart to say i am sorry.
now i have not got a heart at all.
i could tolerate the pain if i could talk to my best friend.
but you will not even call.
you wont even call, oh yeah, did not call me baby.

i am contemplating pulling out my suitcase.
and packing everything i own.
i did not back then but i do know now.
wherever you are is home.
i will crawl on my belly and beg you.
but your so far away.
you have only been gone for an hour.
but it seems like a million days a million days, a million days.

its only been a hour since you left me.
i wish i had somebody to blame.
but your the perfect picture of what love should look like.
and i wanna be your frame.
its only been a hour but it feels like a million days.

a million days.
one hundred thousand million days.
come home, come home baby.
i can not take this no more.
well, come home baby oh yeah.
baby, i know i should not put my faith in heroes.
but i can not see you any other way.
its only been a hour since you left me girl.
feels like a million, feels like a million days.

come on home baby..
