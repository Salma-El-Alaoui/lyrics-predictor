you gotta keep em separated.

like the latest fashion.
like a spreading disease.
the kids are strapping on their way to the classroom.
getting weapons with the greatest of ease.
the gangs stake their own campus locale.
and if they catch you slipping then its all over pal.
if one guys colors and the others do not mix.
they are gonna bash it up, bash it up, bash it up, bash it up.

hey   man you talking back to me?
take him out.
you gotta keep em separated.
hey   man you disrespecting me?
take him out.
you gotta keep em separated.
hey they do not pay no mind.
if you are under 18 you will not be doing any time.
hey come out and play.

by the time you hear the siren.
its already too late.
one goes to the morgue and the other to jail.
one guys wasted and the others a waste.
it goes down the same as the thousand before.
no ones getting smarter.
no ones learning the score.
your never ending spree of death and violence and hate.
is gonna tie your own rope, tie your own rope, tie your own.

hey   man you disrespecting me?
