do unto others as they have done to you.
but what the hell is this world coming to?

blow the universe into nothingness.
nuclear warfare shall lay us to rest.

fight fire with fire.
ending is near.
fight fire with fire.
bursting with fear.

we all shall die.

time is like a fuse, short and burning fast.
armageddons here, like said in the past.

fight fire with fire.
ending is near.
fight fire with fire.
bursting with fear.

soon to fill our lungs the hot winds of death.
the gods are laughing, so take your last breath.

fight fire with fire.
ending is near.
fight fire with fire.
bursting with fear.
