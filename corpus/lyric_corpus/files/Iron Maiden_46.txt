born into a scene.
of angriness and greed.
of dominance and persecution.

my mother was a queen.
my dad i have never seen.
i was never meant to be.

now i spend my time.
looking all around.
for a man thats nowhere.
to be found.
until i find him.
i am never gonna stop searching.
i am going to find my man.
gonna travel round.

so long wrathchild.
yeah i am a wrathchild.
hello wrathchild.
coming to get you.
oooh yeaheyeah.

some say it should not matter.
aingt nothing gonna alter.
the course of my destination.

but i know i have gotta find.
some seriaus peace of mind.
or i know i will just go crazy.

now i spend my time.
looking all around.
for a man thats nowhere.
to be found.
until i find him.
i am never gonna stop searching.
i am going to find my man.
gonna travel round.

so long wrathchild.

yeah wrathchild.
