when johnny comes marching home again.
hurah, tudah.
hes coming by bus or underground.
hurah, tudah.
a womans eye will shed a tear.
to see his face so beaten in fear.
an it was just around the corner in the english civil war.

it was still at the stage of clubs and fists.
hurah, tudah.
when that well known face got beaten to bits.
hurah, tudah.
your face was blue in the light of the screen.
as we watched the speech of an animal scream.
the new party army was marching right over our heads.

alright.

there you are, ha ha, i told you so.
tudah, hyurah.
says everybody that we know.
hurah, tudah.
but who hid a radio under the stairs.
an who got caught out on their unawares.
new party army came marching right up the stairs.

when johnny comes marching home again.
hurah, tudah.
nobody understands it can happen again.
hurah, tudah.
the sun is shining an the kids are shouting loud.
but you gotta know its shining through a crack in the cloud.
and the shadows keep on falling.
when johnny comes marching home.

alright.

oka.......ay.

all the towns go.
o.... o.
o. o............
