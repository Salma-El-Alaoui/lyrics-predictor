it is the springtime of my loving.
the second season i am to know.
you are the sunlight in my growing.
so little warmth i have felt before.
it is not hard to feel me glowing.
i watched the fire that grew so low.

it is the summer of my smiles.
flee from me keepers of the gloom.
speak to me only with your eyes.
it is to you i give this tune.
aingt so hard to recognize.
these things are clear to all from time to time.

talk talk talk talk.
i have felt the coldness of my winter.
i never thought it would ever go.
i cursed the gloom that set upon us, pon us, pon us.
but i know that i love you so.
but i know that i love you so.

these are the seasons of emotion.
and like the winds, they rise and fall.
this is the wonder of devotion.
i see the torch we all must hold.
this is the mystery of the quotient.
upon us, upon us all a little rain must fall.
just a little rain.
