i was riding shotgun with my hair undone in the front seat of his car.
hes got a one hand feel on the steering wheel.
the other on my heart.
i look around, turn the radio down.
he says baby is something wrong?
i say nothing i was just thinking how we do not have a song.
and he says...


our song is the slamming screen door.
sneaking out late, tapping on your window.
when we are on the phone and you talk real slow.
cause its late and your mama do not know.
our song is the way you laugh.
the first date man, i did not kiss her, and i should have.
and when i got home ... before i said amen.
asking god if he could play it again.

i was walking up the front porch steps after everything that day.
had gone all wrong or been trampled on.
and lost and thrown away.
got to the hallway, well on my way to my loving bed.
i almost did not notice all the roses.
and the note that said...

our song is the slamming screen door.
sneaking out late, tapping on your window.
when we are on the phone and you talk real slow.
cause its late and your mama do not know.
our song is the way you laugh.
the first date man, i did not kiss her, and i should have.
and when i got home ... before i said amen.
asking god if he could play it again.

i have heard every album, listened to the radio.
waited for something to come along.
that was as good as our song...

cause our song is the slamming screen door.
sneaking out late, tapping on his window.
when we are on the phone and he talks real slow.
cause its late and his mama do not know.
our song is the way he laughs.
the first date man, i did not kiss him, and i could have.
and when i got home, before i said amen.
asking god if he could play it again.

i was riding shotgun with my hair undone.
in the front seat of his car.
i grabbed a pen and an old napkin.
and i... wrote down our song.
