you walk through the subway.
his eyes burn a hole in your back.
a footstep behind you.
he lunges prepared for attack.

scream for mercy.
he laughs as hes watching you bleed.
killer behind you.
his blood lust defies all his needs.

my innocent victims.
are slaughtered with wrath and despise.
the mocking religion of hatred.
that burns in the night.

i have no one.
am bound to destroy.
all this greed.
a voice inside me.
compelling to satisfy me.

i can see.
what a lifes meant to be.
you will never know.
how i came to foresee.

my faith in believing is stronger.
than lifelines and ties.
with the glimmer of metal.
my moment is ready to strike.

the death call arises.
a scream breaks the still of the night.
another tomorrow.
remember to walk in the light.

i have found you.
and now there is no place to run.
excitement shakes me.
oh god help me what have i done.


yeah i have done it again!

he walks through the subway.
his eyes burn a hole through your back.
a footstep behind you.
he lunges prepared for attack.

scream for mercy.
he laughs as hes watching you bleed.
killer behind you.
his blood lust defies all his needs.

look out i am coming for you!
