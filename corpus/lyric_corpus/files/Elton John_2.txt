the spotlights hitting something.
thats been known to change the weather.

so stick around.
you are gonna hear electric music.
solid walls of sound.

ooh, but they are so spaced out.
bennie and the jets.
oh, but they are weird and they are wonderful.
oh, bennie shes really keen.
shes got electric boots.
a mohair suit.

bennie and the jets.

hey kids, plug into the faithless.
maybe they are blinded.
but bennie makes them ageless.
we shall survive.
let us take ourselves along.
where we fight our parents out in the streets.
to find whos right and whos wrong.

oh, candy and ronnie, have you seen them yet.
oh, but they are so spaced out.
