i am getting edgy.
all the time.
theres someone around me.
just a step behind.
its kinda scary.
the shape i am in.
the walls are shaking.
and they are closing in.
too fast or.
a bit too slow.
i am paranoid of people.
and its starting to show.
theres one guy that.
i can not shake.
over my shoulder.
is a big mistake.

sitting on the bed.
or lying wide awake.
theres demons in my head.
and its more than i can take.
i think i am on a roll.
but i think its kinda weak.
saying all i know is.
i gotta get away from me.

i tell you something.
just aingt right.
my head is on loose.
but my shoes are tight.
avoiding friends cause.
they all bug.
life is like a riddle.
and i am really stumped.
if you reason.
do not you know.
your own preoccupation.
is where you will go.
i think i am being followed.
i look around.
its only my shadow.
creeping on the ground.

sitting on the bed.
or lying wide awake.
theres demons in my head.
and its more than i can take.
i think i am on a roll.
but i think its kinda weak.
saying all i know is.
i gotta get away from me.
gotta get away from me.
gotta get away from me.

whoa oah oah, whoa oah oah.
whoa oah oah, whoa oah oah.

sitting on the bed.
or lying wide awake.
theres demons in my head.
and its more than i can take.
i think i am on a roll.
but i think its kinda weak.
saying all i know is.
i gotta get away from me.
gotta get away from me.
gotta get away from me.
gotta get away from me.
