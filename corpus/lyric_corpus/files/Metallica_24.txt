living and dying laughing and crying.
once you have seen it you will never be the same.
life in the fast lane is just how it seems.
hard and it is heavy and dirty and mean.

motorbreath.
its how i live my life.
i can not take it any other way.
motorbreath.
the sign of living fast.
it is going to take.
your breath away.

do not stop for nothing its full speed or nothing.
i am taking down you know whatever is in my way.
getting your kicks as you are shooting the line.
sending the shivers up and down my spine.

motorbreath.
its how i live my life.
i can not take it any other way.
motorbreath.
the sign of living fast.
it is going to take.
your breath away.

those people who tell you not to take chances.
they are all missing on what life is about.
you only live once so take hold of the chance.
do not end up like others the same song and dance.

motorbreath.
its how i live my life.
i can not take it any other way.
motorbreath.
the sign of living fast.
it is going to take.
your breath away.
