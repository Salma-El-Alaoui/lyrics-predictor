say goodnight.
she waits for me to turn out the light.
really still.
she waits to break my will.

yes, and i know the truth about you.
she cat.

and in the daylight.
a blackbird makes a violent sight.
and when she is done.
she sleeps beside the one.

yes, and i know the truth about you.
she cat.

yes, and i know the truth about you.
she cat.
