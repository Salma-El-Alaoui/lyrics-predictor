i do not want to be your friend.
i just want to be your lover.
no matter how it ends.
no matter how it starts.

forget about your house of cards.
and i will do mine.
forget about your house of cards.
and i will do mine.

fall off the table.
get swept under.
denial, denial.

the infrastructure will collapse.
voltage spikes.
throw your keys in the bowl.
kiss your husband goodnight.

forget about your house of cards.
and i will do mine.
forget about your house of cards.
and i will do mine.

fall off the table.
and get swept under.

denial, denial.
denial, denial.
your ears should be burning.
denial, denial.
your ears should be burning.
denial, denial.
