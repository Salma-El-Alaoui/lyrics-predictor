we have been friends now for so many years.
we have been together through the good times and the tears.
turned each other on to the good things that life has to give.

we drift apart for a little bit of a spell.
one night i get a call and i know that you are well.
and days i was down you would help me get out of my hole.

ohhhhhhhh.

let us be friends.
let us be friends.
let us be friends.

you told me when my girl was untrue.
i loaned you money when the funds were not too cool.
i talked your folks out of making you cut off your hair.

we have been friends now for so many years.
we have been together through the good times and the tears.
dim dipple ee dim dipple ay dim dipple oo dim dee aye oh.
