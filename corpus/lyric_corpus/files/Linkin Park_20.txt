it starts with one thing, i do not know why.
it does not even matter how hard you try.
keep that in mind, i designed this rhyme.
to explain in due time all i know.
time is a valuable thing.
watch it fly by as the pendulum swings.
watch it count down to the end of the day.
the clock ticks life away, its so unreal.
did not look out below.
watched the time go right out the window.
tried to hold on, but did not even know.
i wasted it all just to watch you go.
i kept everything inside.
and even though i tried, it all fell apart.
what it meant to me will eventually be.
a memory of a time when.

i tried so hard.
and got so far.
but in the end.
it does not even matter.
i had to fall.
to lose it all.
but in the end.
it does not even matter.

one thing, i do not know why.
it does not even matter how hard you try.
keep that in mind, i designed this rhyme.
to remind myself how i tried so hard.
in spite of the way you were mocking me.
acting like i was part of your property.
remembering all the times you fought with me.
i am surprised that it got so far.
things are not the way they were before.
you would not even recognize me anymore.
not that you knew me back then.
but it all comes back to me in the end.
i kept everything inside.
and even though i tried, it all fell apart.
what it meant to me will eventually be.
a memory of a time when.

i tried so hard.
and got so far.
but in the end.
it does not even matter.
i had to fall.
to lose it all.
but in the end.
it does not even matter.

i put my trust in you.
pushed as far as i can go.
for all this.
theres only one thing you should know.
