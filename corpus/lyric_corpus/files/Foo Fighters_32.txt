have you found your way around the down and out?
i know it must seem long, so long.
i am still trying to keep this time from running out.
head down, always moving on and on and on.

i never heard this warning.
another early morning takes me, wakes me into.
if you could manage me.
i will try to manage you.
but lately its all i ever do.

chorus.
i felt like this on my way home.
i am not scared.
i pass the boats and the kingdome.
i am not scared.

i will never tell you the secrets i am holding.
i know these things must bore you.
but i can not find another way.
i will never tell you the secrets i am holding.
i love this leash that holds me.
when i try to run away.

repeat chorus 8x.

i am not scared.
