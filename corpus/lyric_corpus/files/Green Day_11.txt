 seventeen and strung out on confusion.
trapped inside a roll of disillusion.
i found out what it takes to be a man.
mom and dad will never understand.

secrets collecting dust but never forget.
skeletons come to life in my closet.

i found out what it takes to be a man.
mom and dad will never understand.
whats happening to me.

seventeen and coming clean for the first time.
i finally figured out myself for the first time.
i found out what it takes to be a man.
mom and dad will never understand.
whats happening to me.
