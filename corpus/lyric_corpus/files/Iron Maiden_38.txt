love is a razor and i walked the line on that silver blade.
slept in the dust with his daughter, her eyes red with.
the slaughter of innocence.
and i will pray for her.
i will call her name out loud.
i would bleed for her.
if i could only see her now.

living on a razors edge.
balancing on a ledge.
living on a razors edge, oaah.
balancing on a ledge.
balancing on a ledge.
living on a razors edge.
balancing on a ledge... you know, you know.

the evil that men do lives on and on...
the evil that men do lives on and on...
the evil that men do lives on and on...
the evil that men do lives on and on...
the evil that men do lives on and on...

circle of fire my baptism of joy at an end it seems.
the seventh lamb slain, the book of life opens before me.
and i will pray for her.
some day i may return.
do not you cry for me.
beyond is where i learn.

living on a razors edge.
balancing on a ledge.
living on a razors edge... you know, you know.

the evil that men do lives on and on...
the evil that men do lives on and on...
the evil that men do lives on and on...
the evil that men do lives on and on...

solo.

living on a razors edge.
balancing on a ledge.
living on a razors edge... you know, you know.

the evil that men do lives on and on...
the evil that men do lives on and on...
the evil that men do lives on and on...
the evil that men do lives on and on...

the evil.
the evil.
the evil that men do.
the evil.
the evil.
the evil that men do, oaah, oaah.
