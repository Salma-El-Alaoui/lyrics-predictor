she packed my bags last night, preflight.
zero hour, nine a.m.
and i am gonna be high.
as a kite by then.

i miss the earth so much.
i miss my wife.
its lonely out in space.
on such a timeless flight.

and i think its gonna be a long, long, time.
til touchdown brings me round again to find.
i am not the man they think i am at home.
ah, no no no...
i am a rocket man.
rocket man.
burning out his fuse.
up here alone.

and i think its gonna be a long, long, time.
til touchdown brings me round again to find.
i am not the man they think i am at home.
ah, no no no...
i am a rocket man.
rocket man.
burning out his fuse.
up here alone.

mars aingt the kind of place.
to raise your kids.
in fact, its cold as hell.
and theres no one there to raise them.
if you did.

and all this science.
i do not understand.
its just my job.
five days a week.
a rocket man.
rocket man.

and i think its gonna be a long, long, time.
til touchdown brings me round again to find.
i am not the man they think i am at home.
ah, no no no...
i am a rocket man.
rocket man.
burning out his fuse.
up here alone.

and i think its gonna be a long, long, time.
