i have been looking so long for you now you will not get away from my grasp.
you have been living so long in hiding in hiding behind that false mask.
and you know and i know that you aingt got long now to last.
your looks and your feelings are just the remains of your past.
you are standing in the wings, there you wait for the curtain to fall.
knowing the terror and holding you have on us all.
yeah, i know that you are gonna scratch me, maim me and maul.
you know i am helpless from your mesmerising cat call.
keep your distance, walk away, do not take his bait.
do not you stray, do not fade away.
watch your step, hes out to get you, come what may.
do not you stray, from the narrow way.
i am running and hiding in my dreams you are always there.
you are the phantom of the opera, you are the devil, you are just out to scare.
you damaged my mind and my soul it just floats through the air.
haunt me, you taunt me, you torture me back at your lair..
