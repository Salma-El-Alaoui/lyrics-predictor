clock strikes upon the hour.
and the sun begins to fade.
still enough time to figure out.
how to chase my blues away.
i have done alright up to now.
its the light of day that shows me how.
and when the night falls, loneliness calls.

oh, i wanna dance with somebody.
i wanna feel the heat with somebody.
yeah, i wanna dance with somebody.
with somebody who loves me.
oh, i wanna dance with somebody.
i wanna feel the heat with somebody.
yeah, i wanna dance with somebody.
with somebody who loves me.

i have been in love and lost my senses.
spinning through the town.
sooner or later, the fever ends.
and i wind up feeling down.
i need a man who will take a chance.
on a love that burns hot enough to last.
so when the night falls.
my lonely heart calls.

oh, i wanna dance with somebody.
i wanna feel the heat with somebody.
yeah, i wanna dance with somebody.
with somebody who loves me.
