i remember when rock was young.
me and suzie had so much fun.
holding hands and skimming stones.
had an old gold chevy and a place of my own.
but the biggest kick i ever got.
was doing a thing called the crocodile rock.
while the other kids were rocking round the clock.
we were hopping and bopping to the crocodile rock.

well croc rocking is something shocking.
when your feet just can not keep still.
i never knew me a better time and i guess i never will.
ow! lordie mama those friday nights.
when suzie wore her dresses tight and.
crocodile rocking was out of sight...
la... la la la la la...
la la la la la... la la la la la...

but the years went by, and the rock just died.
suzie went and left me for some foreign guy.
long nights crying by the record machine.
dreaming of my chevy and my old blue jeans.
but they will never kill the thrills we have got.
burning up to the crocodile rock.
learning fast as the weeks went past.
we really thought the crocodile rock would last.

well crocodile rocking is something shocking.
when your feet just can not keep still.
i never knew me a better time and i guess i never will.
ow! lordie mama those friday nights.
when suzie wore her dresses tight and.
crocodile rocking was out of sight.
