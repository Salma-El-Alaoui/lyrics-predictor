the rain is here and you, my dear, are still my friend.
its true, the two of us are back as one again.

chorus.
i was the one who left you.
always coming back.
i cannot forget you, girl.
now i am up in arms again.

repeat all.

together now i do not know how this love could end.
my lonely heart, it falls apart for you to mend.

chorus 3x.
