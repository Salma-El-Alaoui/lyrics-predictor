when you refuse me.
you confuse me.
what makes you think i will let you in again.
think again my friend.
go on misuse me and abuse me.
i will come out stronger in the end.

and does it make you sad.
to find yourself alone.
and does it make you mad.
to find that i have grown.
i will bet it hurts so bad.
to see the strength that i have shown.

when you answer the door pick up the phone.
you wont find me cause i am not coming home.

you do not know how much this hurts me.
to say these things that i do not want to say.
but have to say them anyway.
i would do anything to end your suffering.
but you would rather walk away.
