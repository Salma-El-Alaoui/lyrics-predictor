i was mixed up when you came to me.
too broke to fix said daddy what you gone, i am missing my baby.
still missing my baby.

i was stitched up by the hands of fate.
said how you gonna make it on your own if luck is a lady?
maybe luck is a lady.

i was going down for the third time.
my heart was broken, i was not open to your suggestions.
i had so many questions.
that you just kissed away.

tell me, i guess that cupid was in disguise.
the day you walked in and changed my life.
i think its amazing.
the way that love can you set you free.

so now i walk in the midday sun.
i never thought that my saviour would come.
i think its amazing.
i think its amazing.

i think you are amazing.

you tried to save me from myself.
said darling, kiss as many as you want!
my loves still available.
and i now you are insatiable.

we are like victims of the same disease.
look at your big bad daddy and your mom.
and your mom... was always acting crazy.

i was going down for the third time.
my heart was broken, i though that loving you was out of the.

question.
then i say my reflection.
saying please do not let this go.

tell me, i guess that cupid was in disguise.
the day you walked in and changed my life.
i think its amazing.
the way that love can you set you free.

so now i walk in the midday sun.
i never thought that my saviour would come.
i think its amazing.
i think you are amazing.

celebrate the love of the one you are with.

celebrate, this life with you baby.
i think you should celebrate yeah.
do not put your love in chains baby.
no no, walk in the midday sun.
i thought i was dreaming.
i think its amazing.
i think you are amazing.

i said celebrate the love of the one you are with.

as this life gets colder.
and the devil inside.
tells you to give up.
