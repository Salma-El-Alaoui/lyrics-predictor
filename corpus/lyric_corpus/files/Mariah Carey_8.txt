they can say anything they want to say.
try to bring me down.
but i will not allow anyone to succeed.
hanging clouds over me.
and they can try hard to make me feel that i.
do not matter at all.
but i refuse to falter in what i believe.
or lose faith in my dreams.
cause there, theres a light in me.
that shines brightly.
they can try but they cant take that away from me.

oh, they, they can do.
anything they want to you.
if you let them in.
but they wont ever win.
if you cling to your pride.
and just push them aside.
see i, i have learned.
theres an inner peace i own.
something in my soul that they cannot possess.
so i wont be afraid and the darkness will fade.

cause there, theres a light in me.
that shines brightly, yes.
they can try but they cant take that away from me.

no, they cant take this precious love i will always have inside me.
certainly the lord will guide me.
where i need to go.

oh, they can say anything they want to say.
try to bring me down.
but i wont face the ground.
i will rise steadily sailing out of their reach.
oh, lord, they do try.
hard to make me feel that i dont matter at all.
but i refuse to falter in what i believe or lose faith in my dreams.
cause theres a light in me.
that shines brightly, yes.
they can try but they cant take that away from me.
