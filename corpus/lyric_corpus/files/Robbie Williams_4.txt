send someone to love me.
i need to rest in arms.
keep me safe from harm.
in pouring rain.

give me endless summer.
lord i fear the cold.
feel i am getting old.
before my time.

as my soul heals the shame.
i will grow through this pain.
lord i am doing all i can.
to be a better man.

go easy on my conscience.
cause its not my fault.
i know i have been taught.
to take the blame.

rest assured my angels.
who catch my tears.
walk me out of here.
i am in pain.

as my soul heals the shame.
i will grow through this pain.
lord i am doing all i can.
to be a better man.

once you have found that lover.
you are homeward bound.
love is all around.
love is all around.

i know some have fallen.
on stony ground.
but love is all around.

send someone to love me.
i need to rest in arms.
keep me safe from harm.
in pouring rain.

give me endless summer.
lord i fear the cold.
feel i am getting old.
before my time.

as my soul heals the shame.
i will grow through this pain.
lord i am doing all i can.
to be a better man.
