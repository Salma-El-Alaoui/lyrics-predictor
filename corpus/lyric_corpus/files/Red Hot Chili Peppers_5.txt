i am a man.
cut from the know.
rarely do friends.
come and then go.
she was a girl.
soft but estranged.
we were the two.
our lives rearranged.
feeling so good that day.
a feeling of love that day.

twisting and turning.
your feelings are burning.
you are breaking the girl.
she meant you no harm.
think you are so clever.
but now you must sever.
you are breaking the girl.
he loves no one else.

raised by my dad.
girl of the day.
he was my man.
that was the way.
she was the girl.
left alone.
feeling the need.
to make me her home.
i do not know what when or why.
the twilight of love had arrived.

twisting and turning.
your feelings are burning.
you are breaking the girl.
she meant you no harm.
think you are so clever.
but now you must sever.
you are breaking the girl.
he loves no one else.
