you take me away, take it from me, yeah!

beautiful prisoner, left here for dead.
promises made and sentences read.
voices and visions are locked in my head.
like a saint full of sorrow.
all of the words that we dared never speak.
all of our ghosts and the secrets we keep.
gather them all and we will bury them deep.
like a saint full of sorrow.

free me right now.
you take me away, take it from me.
free me right now.
you take me away, take it from me, hey!

one for forever.
one in the name.
once to remember.
we are one and the same.
one to forget but it always remains.
like a saint full of sorrow.
