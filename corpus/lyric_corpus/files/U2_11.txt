calling, calling the sun is burning black.
calling, calling, its beating on my back.
with a fire.
with a fire.

calling, calling, the moon is running red.
calling, calling, its pulling me instead.
with a fire, fire.

but theres a fire inside.
and i am falling over.
theres a fire in me.
when i call out.
you built a fire, fire.
i am going home.

calling, calling, the stars are falling down.
calling, calling, they knock me to the ground.
with a fire, fire.

but theres a fire inside.
and i am falling over.
theres a fire inside.
when i call out.
theres a fire inside.
when i am falling over.
you built a fire, fire.
i am going home..
