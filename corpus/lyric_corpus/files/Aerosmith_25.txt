finders keepers, losers weep.
down on 42nd street.
aw barefoot children crying, my oh my.

while other men were having you.
i think that you should let your caged bird fly.

and kiss your past goodbye.
kiss your past goodbye, yeah.
kiss your past goodbye, yayah.

i have been so lost i must confess.
i had my share of loneliness.
but yeah, its hard to keep a good man down.

the loves you lost were all in vain.
the past is all inside your brain.
i do not think you need those memories hanging round.

and kiss your past goodbye.

your broken heart on needs a fix.
your feeding off a high that will not last.
