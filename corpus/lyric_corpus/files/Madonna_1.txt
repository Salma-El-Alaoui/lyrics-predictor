you took a pretty picture.
and you smashed it into bits.
sank me into blackness.
and you sealed it with a kiss.

if only i could let you go.
why do i need you so.

chorus.

its amazing what a boy can do.
i cannot stop myself.
wish i did not want you like i do.
want you and no one else.

you took a poison arrow.
and you aimed it at my heart.
its heavy and its bitter.
and its tearing me apart.

if only i could set you free.
you worked your way inside of me.

chorus.

chorus 2.

its amazing what a boy can say.
i cannot stop myself.
seems i love you more than yesterday.
love you and no one else.

oh, its amazing.

chorus.
chorus2.

its amazing.
oh, its amazing.

i cannot stop myself.
wish i did not.
love you and no one else.
