i did not know.
what i would find.
when i went lookin for a reason.
i know.
i did not read between the lines.
and baby i have got nowhere to go.
i tried to take the road less traveled by.
but nothing seems to work the first few times.
am i right.


so how can i ever, try to be better.
nobody ever, let us me in.
and i can still see you.
this aingt the best view.
on the outside looking in.
i have been alot of lonely places.
i have never been on the outside.


you saw me there, but never knew.
that i would give it all just to be.
a part of this.
a part of you.
and now its all too late so you see.
you could have helped if you had wanted to.
but no one notices until its too late to do anything.
