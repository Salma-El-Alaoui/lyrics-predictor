one day in your life.
you will remember a place.
someone touching your face.
you will come back and you will look around, you will . . .

one day in your life.
you will remember the love you found here.
you will remember me somehow.
though you do not need me now.
i will stay in your heart.
and when things fall apart.
you will remember one day . . .

one day in your life.
when you find that you are always waiting.
for a love we used to share.
just call my name, and i will be there.

you will remember me somehow.
though you do not need me now.
i will stay in your heart.
and when things fall apart.
you will remember one day . . .

one day in your life.
when you find that you are always lonely.
for a love we used to share.
just call my name, and i will be there.
