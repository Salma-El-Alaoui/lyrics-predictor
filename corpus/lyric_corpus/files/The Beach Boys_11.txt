well its been building up inside of me.
for oh i do not know how long.
i do not know why but i keep thinking.
somethings bound to go wrong.

but she looks in my eyes.
and makes me realize.
and she says do not worry baby.
do not worry baby.
do not worry baby.
everything will turn out alright.

do not worry baby.
do not worry baby.
do not worry baby.

i guess i should have kept my mouth shut.
when i started to brag about my car.
but i can not back down now because.
i pushed the other guys too far.

she makes me come alive.
and makes me wanna drive.
when she says do not worry baby.
do not worry baby.
do not worry baby.
everything will turn out alright.

do not worry baby.
do not worry baby.
do not worry baby.

she told me baby, when you race today.
just take along my love with you.
and if you knew how much i loved you.
baby nothing could go wrong with you.

oh what she does to me.
when she makes love to me.
and she says do not worry baby.
do not worry baby.
do not worry baby.
everything will turn out alright.

do not worry baby.
do not worry baby.
do not worry baby.
