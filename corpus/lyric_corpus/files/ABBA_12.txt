i have a very good friend.
the kind of girl who likes to follow a trend.
she has a personal style.
some people like it, others tend to go wild.
you hear her voice everywhere.
taking the chair.
shes a leading lady.
and with no trace of hesitation she keeps going.

head over heels.
breaking her way.
pushing through unknown jungles every day.
shes a girl with a taste for the world.
the world is like a playing ground where she goes rushing.
head over heels.
setting the pace.
running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace.
shes extreme, if you know what i mean.

her man is one i admire.
hes so courageous but hes constantly tired.
each time when he speaks his mind.
she pats his head and says, thats all very fine.
exert that will of your own.
when youre alone.
now wed better hurry.
and with no trace of hesitation she keeps going.

head over heels.
breaking her way.
pushing through unknown jungles every day.
shes a girl with a taste for the world.
the world is like a playing ground where she goes rushing.
head over heels.
setting the pace.
running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace.
shes extreme, if you know what i mean.

you hear her voice everywhere.
taking the chair.
shes a leading lady.
and with no trace of hesitation she keeps going.

head over heels.
breaking her way.

shes a girl with a taste for the world.
the world is like a playing ground where she goes rushing.
head over heels.
setting the pace.
running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace.
shes extreme, if you know what i mean.
shes just one of those who always has to do whatever she please.
and she goes.
head over heels.
