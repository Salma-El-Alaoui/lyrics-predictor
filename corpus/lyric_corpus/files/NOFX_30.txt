i am a person just like you.

but i have got better things to do.

than sit around and fuck my head.

hang out with the living dead.

snort white shit up my nose.

pass out at the shows.

i do not even think about speed.

thats something i just do not need.



i have got the straight edge.



i am a person just like you.

but i have got better things to do.

than sit around and smoke dope.

cause i know i can cope.

laugh at the thought of eating ludes.

laugh at the thought of sniffing glue.

always gonna keep in touch.

never want to use a crutch.



i have got the straight edge.
