i am leaving today.
living it.
leaving it.
to change.

slowly drifting.
into a peaceful breeze.
tongue tied and twisted.
are all my memories.
celebrating a fantasy come true.
packing all my bags.
finally on the move.

i am leaving today.
i am living it.
oh i am leaving it.
to change.

as i am driving.
i am captured by the view.
so much beauty.
the road becomes my muse.
the heat is rising.
and my hand surfs through the wind.
cool, calm, collected.
is the child that lies within.

see i am leaving today.
i am living it.
oh i am leaving it.
to change, oh yeah.

see i am leaving today, oh yes i am.
living it.
oh i am leaving it.
to change.

but somehow i miss it.
i think i will really miss it.
one day, ohh.

i turn on the radio.
and i am feeling like i have never felt before.
turn down the memories of.
yesteryears and broken dreams i am free.
finally free, ooh.

slowly drifting.
into a peaceful breeze, oh.
ohh.

ooh yeah.
i am leaving today, oh yes i am.
living it, oh yeah.
leaving it to change.
to change, oh no.

see i am leaving today, oh yes i am.
living it, living it.
leaving it, leaving.
to change.
ohh oh.

i am leaving today.
oh i am living it.
i am leaving it to change.
living it, to change.
leaving it.
to change.
ooh, oh yeah.

living it, leaving it.
said i am living it.
i am leaving it.
living it, leaving it.
to change.
i am leaving it to change.

but somehow i miss it.
i think i will really miss it.
one day, yeah.
