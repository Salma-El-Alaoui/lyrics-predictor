i want to be the minority.
i do not need your authority.
down with the moral majority.
cause i want to be the minority.

i pledge allegiance to the underworld.
one nation under dog.
there of which i stand alone.
a face in the crowd.
unsung, against the mold.
without a doubt.
singled out.
the only way i know cause.

i want to be the minority.
i do not need your authority.
down with the moral majority.
cause i want to be the minority.

stepped out of the line.
like a sheep runs from the herd.
marching out of time.
to my own beat now.
the only way i know.

one light, one mind.
flashing in the dark.
blinded by the silence of a thousand broken hearts.
for crying out loud she screamed unto me.
a free for all.
fuck em all.
you are what you are inside cause.

i want to be the minority.
i do not need your authority.
down with the moral majority.
cause i want to be the minority, hey!

one light, one mind.
flashing in the dark.
blinded by the silence of a thousand broken hearts.
for crying out loud she screamed unto me.
a free for all.
fuck em all.
you are what you are inside cause.

i want to be the minority.
i do not need your authority.
down with the moral majority.
cause i want to be the minority i want to be.

the minority i want to be.
the minority i want to be.
the minority i want to be.
the minority.
