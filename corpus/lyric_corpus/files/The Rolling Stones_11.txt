well i never kept a dollar past sunset.
it always burned a hole in my pants.
never made a school mama happy.
never blew a second chance, oh no.

i need love to keep me happy.
i need love to keep me happy.
baby, baby keep me happy.
baby, baby keep me happy.

always took candy from strangers.
did not wanna get me no trade.
never want to be like papa.
working for the boss every night and day.

i need love to keep me happy.
i need love, baby will not ya keep me happy.
baby, will not ya keep me happy.
baby, please keep me.

i need love to keep me happy.
i need love to keep me happy.
baby, baby keep me happy.

never got a flash out of cocktails.
when i got some flesh off the bone.
never got a lift out of lear jets.
when i can fly way back home.

i need love to keep me happy.
i need love to keep me happy.
baby, baby keep me happy.
baby, baby keep me happy.
