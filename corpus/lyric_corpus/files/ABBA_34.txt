i hear the doorbell ring and suddenly the panic takes me.
the sound so ominously tearing through the silence.
i cannot move, i am standing.
numb and frozen.
among the things i love so dearly.
the books, the paintings and the furniture.
help me.

the signals sounding once again and someone tries the door knob.
none of my friends would be so stupidly impatient.
and they do not dare to come here.
anymore now.
but how i loved our secret meetings.
we talked and talked in quiet voices.
smiling.

now i hear them moving.
muffled noises coming through the door.
i feel i am.
cracking up.
voices growing louder, irritation building.
and i am close to fainting.
cracking up.
they must know by now i am in here trembling.
in a terror evergrowing.
cracking up.
my whole world is falling, going crazy.
there is no escaping now, i am.
cracking up.

these walls have witnessed all the anguish of humiliation.
and seen the hope of freedom glow in shining faces.
and now they have come to take me.
come to break me.
and yet it is not unexpected.
i have been waiting for these visitors.
help me.

now i hear them moving.
muffled noises coming through the door.
i feel i am.
cracking up.
voices growing louder, irritation building.
and i am close to fainting.
cracking up.
they must know by now i am in here trembling.
in a terror evergrowing.
cracking up.
my whole world is falling, going crazy.
there is no escaping now, i am.
cracking up.
