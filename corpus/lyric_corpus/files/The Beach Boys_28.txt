what good is the dawn.
that grows into day.
the sunset at night.
or living this way.

for i have the warmth of the sun.
warmth of the sun.
within me at night.
within me at night.

the love of my life.
she left me one day.
i cried when she said.
ampquoti do not feel the same wayampquot.

still i have the warmth of the sun.
warmth of the sun.
within me tonight.
within me tonight.

i will dreams of her arms.
and though they are not real.
just like shes still there.
the way that i feel.

i loved like the warmth of the sun.
warmth of the sun.
it will not ever die.
it will not ever die.
