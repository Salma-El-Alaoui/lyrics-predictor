6 bottles went down the drain.
one hours a waste of time.
id ask if you feel the same.
still pushin that chance to try.
your breath in this cool room chill.
long hair that blows side to side.
you speak and make time stand still.
and each time you walk right on by.

like violence you have me, forever, and after.
like violence you kill me, forever and after.

ca not count all the eyes that stare.
ca not count all the things they see.
she kills with no life to spare.
just victims are left to bleed.
one drink and the pain goes down.
soft shadows lay by her feet.
lay soft as you slowly drown.
lay still as you fall asleep.
fall asleep.
