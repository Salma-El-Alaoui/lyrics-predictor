when i am feeling tired.
she pushed food through the door.
and i crawl towards the crack of light.
sometimes i can not find my way.
newspapers spread around soaking all that they can.
a cleaning is due again, a good hosing down.

the lady whom i feel maternal love for.
can not look me in the eyes.
but i see hers and they are blue.
and they cock and twitch and masturbate.

i said so.
i said so.
i said so.
nirvana.
nirvana.
nirvana.
nirvana.
nirvana.
nirvana.

black windows of paint i scratched with my nails.
i see others just like me, why do they not try to escape?
they bring out the older ones, they point in my way.
they come with a flash of light and take my family away.

and very later i have learned to.
accept some friends or ridicule.
my whole existence is for your amusement.
and that is why i am here with you.

to take.
me with.
you are right.

nirvana.
nirvana.
nirvana.
nirvana.
nirvana.
nirvana.
nirvana.
nirvana.
