all you slingers and fiends.
hide behind your rocks.
put down your gloves.
i am not here to box.
this is no showdown.
so throw down your guns.
you see it does not matter.
where you come from.
you could be from park ave.
or from a park bench.
you could be a politician.
or a bitchy princess.
but if you are looking for a fist.
and you are looking to unite.
put your knuckleheads together.
make a fist and fight.
not to your death.
and not to your grave.
i am talking bout that freedom.
fight like a brave.

fight like a brave   do not be a slave.
no one can tell you you have got to be afraid.

if you are sick a sick n tired.
of being sick and tired.
if you are sick of all the bullshit.
and you are sick of all the lies.
its better late than never.
to set a set it straight.
you know the lie is dead.
so give yourself a break.
get it through your head.
and get it off your chest.
get it out your arm.
because its time to start fresh.
you want to stop dying.
the life you could be living.
i am here to tell a story.
but i am also here to listen.
no i am not your preacher.
and i am not your physician.
i am just trying to reach you.
i am a rebel with a mission.

fight like a brave   do not be a slave.
no one can tell you you have got to be afraid.
fight like a brave   do not be a slave.
no one can tell you you have got to be afraid.

you say you are running and you are running.
and you are running afraid.
you say you ran across the planet.
but you could not get away.
the fire in your brain.
was driving you insane.
you were looking for a day.
in a life that never came.
so do not tell me that.
i have got to take a number.
cause i have been to that doctor.
and believe me thats a bummer.
hes one of a kind.
convention of the mind.
and do not forget to mention.
that it does not cost a dime.
come as you like.
and leave any time.
and one more thing.
you know it does not have to rhyme.

fight like a brave   do not be a slave.
no one can tell you you have got to be afraid.
fight like a brave   do not be a slave.
no one can tell you you have got to be afraid.
fight like a brave   do not be a slave.
no one can tell you you have got to be afraid.
fight like a brave   do not be a slave.
no one can tell you you have got to be afraid.
