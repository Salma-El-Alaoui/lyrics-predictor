standing in the bog of a west end bar.
guy on the right leaning over too far.
money in my pocket gonna put it in the slot.
open up the pack see what type i got.

chorus.
i did not want to hold you.
i did not want to use you.
protex, protex blue.
all wanna do.

its a fab protective for that type of a girl.
but everybody knows that she uses it well.
its the therapeutic structure i can use at will.
but i do not think it fits my b.d. drill.

sitting in a carriage of a bakerloo.
erotica my pocket got a packet for you.
advert on the escalator on my way home.
i do not need no skin flicks, i wanna be alone.

chorus.

johnny, johnny.
