jennifer lost the war today.
you will find her burned and raped.
through it all.
she must have wondered.
what have i done.
but nobody really cares today.
the worlds a busy place.
guess she must have really sinned.

i guess we are all just soldiers.
she was only six years old.
left to die by strangers.
her family waits.
and if we are all just soldiers.
is it so wrong to be afraid.

phoebe lost the war today.
there must be some mistake.
say it happens all the time.
and its said and done.
and little miss 1565 your soul remains unclaimed.
guess you must have really sinned.

morality will not help her.
when she lies silent in a morgue.
and all our sorrows just do not count at all.
but will the morning headlines.
even say that its a shame.
what are we heading for.

seen it all before.
silent on the ground.
as hes walking away.
and i wonder how many more.
everybody takes it.
like its nothing at all.
jennifer lost the war.
