can we touch the soul of heaven?
can we unite a sacred lesson?
every child creates a skylight...of beauty.
can you hear cathedrals falling.
all the universe is calling.
cry a single cello...from your heart.

since the world has lost her way.
loneliness journey endlessly.
yet the promised chance remains.
gift of what could be.

so let the children remember the sun.
let them dance, let them soar.
for their lives have begun.
let the children engender the rain.
as the river runs through fields.
forever subsiding their pain.
prayer...

every voice along the shoreline.
standing still within time.
spinning unresolved...the walking.
as each season passes.
through wonderland, through looking glasses.
the secret garden shines...beckons you.
gentle flower do not fade away.
sweet innocence still harbors thee.
in the faith of golden dreams.
where one love lives eternally.

let the children remember the sun.
let them dance, let them soar.
for their lives have begun.
let the children engender the rain.
as the river runs through fields.
forever subsiding their pain.
prayer...

prayer...

ohhhhh...
bless the children for they are the light.
they are the truth of spirit in flight.
yes the children engender the rain.
as the river runs through life.
healing their pain.
you can trust with your heart one more time.
sweet angel conceived.
you have forever and always believed...

prayer...prayer...

prayer....
