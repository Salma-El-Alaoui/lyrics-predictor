no mercy for what we are doing.
no thought to even what we have done.
we do not need to feel the sorrow.
no remorse for the helpless one.

war without end.

no remorse no repent.
we do not care what it meant.
another day another death.
another sorrow another breath.
no remorse no repent.
we do not care what it meant.
another day another death.
another sorrow another breath.

blood feeds the war machine.
as it eats its way across the land.
we do not need the feel the sorrow.
no remorse is the one command.

war without end.
no remorse no repent.
we do not care what it meant.
another day another death.
another sorrow another breath.
no remorse no repent.
we do not care what it meant.
another day another death.
another sorrow another breath.

only the strong survive.
no one to save the weaker race.
we are ready to kill all comers.
like a loaded gun right at your face.

war without end.
no remorse no repent.
we do not care what it meant.
another day another death.
another sorrow another breath.
no remorse no repent.
we do not care what it meant.
another day another death.
another sorrow another breath.

attack.
bullets are flying.
people are dying.
with madness surrounding all hells breaking loose.
soldiers are hounding.
bodies are mounting.
cannons are shouting to take their abuse.
with war machines going.
blood starts to flowing.
no mercy given to anyone hear.
the furious fighting.
swords are like lighting.
it all becomes frightening to you.
know death is near.
no remorse.
