i keep looking for a place to fit.
where i can speak my mind.
i have been trying hard to find the people.
that i will not leave behind.

they say i got brains.
but they aingt doing me no good.
i wish they could.

each time things start to happen again.
i think i got something good going for myself.
but what goes wrong.

sometimes i feel very sad.
sometimes i feel very sad.
ca not find nothing i can put my heart and soul into.
sometimes i feel very sad.
ca not find nothing i can put my heart and soul into.

i guess i just was not made for these times.

every time i get the inspiration.
to go change things around.
no one wants to help me look for places.
where new things might be found.

where can i turn when my fair weather friends cop out.
whats it all about.
