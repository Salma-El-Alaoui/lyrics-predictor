i know bobby well.
well enough to tell you.

well enough to tell you.
hes a hell a swell a fella.
well enough to tell you.
that we know each other better.
than we know our selves.
like freaks of a feather.
we rock together.
i know bob well.
but i think he knows me better.

i will be standing by my buddy.
he will be standing by me.
just another half of.
the two headed freak.
but i need him like.
my heart needs to beat.
at this point.
in this friendly verse.
i have gotta sing a little something.
that i have not rehearsed.

because hes guided by.
the invisible force.
he drives a kooky green chrysler.

hes a working class drummer.
hes as strong as a horse.
