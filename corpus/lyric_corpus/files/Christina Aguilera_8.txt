do not make me love you till i am ready.
do not make me give you more than my kisses.
i need you to go slow and steady.
do not make me love you till i am ready, oh.

why you wanna rush into my life?
do not you wanna stop and get to know me better?
we got all the time in the world tonight.
and if we are meant to be we will be together.
stay around just slow down.
till we find out if we got what it takes.

do not make me love you till i am ready.
do not make me give you more than my kisses.
i need you to go slow and steady.
do not make me love you till i am ready.

everything i know about you so far.
makes me believe that you are the one for me.
but theres still a lot thats on my mind.
and i need time before we go further.
do not you see?
so hold me, hold me.
but do not be thinking i do not want you too.

do not make me love you till i am ready.
do not make me give you more than my kisses.
i need you to go slow and steady.
do not make me love you till i am ready.
2x.

its been a little bit of mystery.
let us wait till we have a bit of history.
behind ourselves.
you do not got to be in such a rush.
we can live for that moment if we trust.
we will be right here tomorrow.

do not make me love you, love you.
do not make me give you.
i need you to go.
do not make me love you.

do not make me love you till i am ready.
do not make me give you more than my kisses.
i need you to go slow and steady.
do not make me love you till i am ready.
