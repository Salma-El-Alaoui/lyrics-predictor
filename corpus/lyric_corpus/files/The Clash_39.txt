you say you stand by your man.
tell me something i do not understand.
you said you love me and thats a fact.
and then you left me, said you felt trapped.
well some things you can not explain away.
but the heartaches in me til this day.

you did not stand by me, no, not at all.
you did not stand by me, no way.

all the times when we were close.
i will remember these things the most.
i see all my dreams come tumbling down.
i can not be happy without you around.
so alone i keep the wolves at bay.
and theres only one thing i can say.

you did not stand by me, no, not at all.
you did not stand by me, no way.

you must explain why this must be.
did you lie when you spoke to me?

did you stand by me.
no, not at all.

now i got a job, but it do not pay.
i need new clothes, i need somewhere to stay.
but without all of these things i can do.
but without your love i will not make it through.
but you do not understand my point of view.
i suppose theres nothing i can do.

you did not stand by me, no, not at all.
you did not stand by me, no way.

you must explain why this must be.
did you lie when you spoke to me?

did you stand by me.
did you stand by me.
no, not at all.
did you stand by me.
no way.
did you stand by me.
no, not at all.
did you stand by me.
no way.
