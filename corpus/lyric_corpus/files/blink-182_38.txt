its hard to wake up.
when the shades have been pulled shut.
this house is haunted.
its so pathetic.
it makes no sense at all.
i am ripe with things to say.
the words rot and fall away.
if a stupid poem could fix this home.
id read it everyday.

so heres your holiday.
hope you enjoy it this time.
you gave it all away.
it was mine.
so when you are dead and gone.
will you remember this night, twenty years.
now lost.
its not right.

their anger hurts my ears.
been running strong for seven years.
rather than fix the problems, they never.
solve them.
it makes no sense at all.
i see them everyday.
we get along, so why can not they?
if this is what he wants and its what.
she wants.
then whys there so much pain?

so heres your holiday.
hope you enjoy it this time.
you gave it all away.
it was mine.
so when you are dead and gone.
will you remember this night, twenty years.
now lost.
its not right.
