sick of this life.
not that youd care.
i am not the only one with.
whom these feelings i share.

nobody understands.
quite why we are here.
we are searching for answers.
that never appear.

but maybe if i looked real hard id.
id see your trying too.
to understand this life.
that we are all going through.
then when she said she was gonna like wreck my car...i did not know what to.
do.

sometimes i feel like i am beating a dead horse.
an i do not know why youd be bringing me down.
id like to think that our loves worth a tad more.
it may sound funny but youd think by now.
id be smiling.
i guess some things never change.
never change.

i met an old cowboy.
i saw the look in his eyes.
something tells me hes been here before.
cause experience makes you wise.
i was only a small child.
when the thought first came to me.
that i am a son of a gun and the gun of a son.
that brought back the devil in me.

sometimes i feel like i am beating a dead horse.
an i do not know why youd be bringing me down.
id like to think that our loves worth a tad more.
it may sound funny but youd think by now.
id be smiling.
i guess some things never change.
never change.

i aingt quite what youd call an old soul.
still wet behind the ears.
i been around this track a couple o times.
but now the dust is starting to clear.
oh yeah!!!

sometimes i feel like i am beating a dead horse.
an i do not know why youd be bringing me down.
id like to think that our loves worth a tad more.
it may sound funny but youd think by now.
id be smiling.
ooh yeah, id be smiling.
no way id be smiling.
ooh smiling.
