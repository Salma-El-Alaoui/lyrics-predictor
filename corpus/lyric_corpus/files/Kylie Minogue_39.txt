your disco, your disco, your disco needs you! x2.

desperately seeking someone.
willing to travel.
you are lost in conversation and.
useless at scrabble.
happiness will never last.
darkness comes to kick your ass.

so let us dance through all of this.
war is over for a bit.
the whole world should be moving.
do your part.
cure a lonely heart.

your disco, your disco, your disco needs you! x2.

we are sold on vanity.
but thats so see through.
take your body to the floor.
your disco needs you.
from soho to singapore.
from the mainland to the shore.

so let us dance through all of this.
war is over for a bit.
you are a slave to the rhythm.
do your part.
cure a lonely heart.

french version.
vous netes jamais seuls.
vous savez ce quil faut faire.
ne laissez pas tomber votre nation.
la disco a besoin de vous.

german version.
du bist niemals allein.
du weit was du tun mut.
lass dein volk nicht im stich.
deine disko braucht dich.

spanish version.
nunca estas sola.
sabes lo que tienes que hacer.
no falles a tu pueblo.
tu discoteca te necesita.

so let us dance through all of this.
war is over for a bit.
the whole world should be moving.
do your part.
cure a lonely heart.

your disco, your disco, your disco needs you! repeat.
