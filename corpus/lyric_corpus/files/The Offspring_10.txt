hey, come inside.
while i stand here acting bold.
ca not stand to feel this way.
clear out the cobwebs in my soul.

this time i turn around.
and things have changed.
now i do not feel the same.
start a fight.
i can not defend.
one more time.
dammit, i changed again.

now i do not see.
things the way i did before.
ca not stand to feel this way.
things i felt yesterday.
do not matter anymore.
it does not make any sense.
to feel so different day to day.
ca not stand to feel this way.
when nothings changed except for me?

x4.
next time i turned around.
and things have changed.
now i do not feel the same.
start a fight.
i can not defend.
one more time.
dammit, i changed again.

i see it.
