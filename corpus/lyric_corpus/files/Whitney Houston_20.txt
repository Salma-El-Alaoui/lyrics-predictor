i know that when you look at me.
theres so much that you just do not see.
but if you would only take the time.
i know in my heart youd find.
oh, a girl, whos scared sometimes.
who is not always strong.
ca not you see the hurt in me.
i feel so all alone.

i wanna run to you.
i wanna run to you.
will not ya hold me in your arms and keep me safe from harm.
i wanna run to you.
but if i come to you.
tell me will you stay.
or will you run away.

each day, each day i play the role.
of someone always in control.
but at night i come home and turn the key.
theres nobody there, no one cares for me.
oh woah whats the sense of trying hard to find your dreams.
without someone to share them with.
tell me what does it mean.

i wanna run to you.
i wanna run to you.
will not ya hold me in your arms and keep me safe from harm.
i wanna run to you.
but if i come to you.
tell me will you stay.
or will you run away.

run away, no.
i need you here i need you here to wipe away my tears.
to kiss away my fears.
no if you only knew how much i wanna run to you.
ya know i wanna run to you.
will not ya hold me in your arms and keep me safe from harm.
i wanna run to you.
but if i come to you.
tell me will you stay.
or will you run away.
