i left alone, my mind was blank.
i needed time to think to get the memories from my mind.

what did i see, can i believe.
that what i saw that night was real.
and not just fantasy.

just what i saw, in my old dreams.
were they reflections of my warped mind.
staring back at me.

cause in my dreams, its always there.
the evil face that twists my mind and brings.
me to despair.
yeah!!!

the night was black, was no use holding back.
cause i just had to see, was someone.
watching me.
in the mist, dark figures move and twist.
was all this for real, or just some kind of hell.
666 the number of the beast.
hell and fire was spawned to be released.

torches blazed and sacred chants were phrased.
as they start to cry, hands held to the sky.
in the night, the fires burning bright.
the ritual has begun, satans work is done.
666 the number of the beast.
sacrifice is going on tonight.

this can not go on, i must inform the lord.
can this still be real or just some crazy dream.
but i feel drawn towards the chanting hordes.
they seem to mesmerize...ca not avoid their eyes.
666 the number of the beast.
666 the one for you and me.

i am coming back, i will return.
and i will possess your body and i will make you burn.
i have the fire, i have the force.
i have the power to make my evil take its course..
