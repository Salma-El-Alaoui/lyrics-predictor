there are just too many times that people have tried to look inside of me.
wondering what i think of you and i protect you out of courtesy.
too many times that i have held on when i needed to push away.
afraid to say what was on my mind, afraid to say what i need to say.
too many things that you have said about me when i am not around.
you think having the upper hand means you have got to keep putting me down.
but i have had too many stand offs with you, its about as much as i can stand.
so i am waiting until the upper hand is mine.

one minute you are on top, the next you are not, watch it drop.
making your heart stop just before you hit the floor.
one minute you are on top, the next you are not, missed your shot.
making your heart stop, you think you have won and then its all gone.

so many people like me put so much trust in all your lies.
so concerned with what you think to just say what we feel inside.
so many people like me walk on eggshells all day long.
all i know is that all i want is to feel like i am not stepped on.
there are so many things you say that make me feel you crossed the line.
what goes up will surely fall and i am counting down the time.
because i have had so many stand offs with you, its about as much as i can stand.
so i am waiting until the upper hand is mine.

one minute you are on top, the next you are not, watch it drop.
making your heart stop just before you hit the floor.
one minute you are on top, the next you are not, missed your shot.
making your heart stop, you think you have won and then its all gone.
and then its all gone and then its all gone and then its all gone.
now its all gone.

i know i will never trust a single thing you say.
you knew your lies would divide us but you lied anyway.
and all the lies have got you floating up above us all.
but what goes up has got to fall.

one minute you are on top, the next you are not, watch it drop.
making your heart stop just before you hit the floor.
one minute you are on top, the next you are not, missed your shot.
making your heart stop, you think you have won and then its all gone.
and then its all gone and then its all gone and then its all gone.
now its all gone.
