there was me and my monkey.
and with his dungarees and rollerblades.
smoking filter tips.
reclining in the passenger seat of my supercharged jet black chevrolet.
he had the soft top down.
he liked the wind in his face.
he said son, you ever been to vegas?
i said no he said thats where we are gonna go.
you need a change of pace.
and when we hit the strip with all the wedding chapels.
and the neon signs he said.
i left my wallet in el segundo.
and proceeded to take two grand of mine.
we made tracks to the mandalay bay hotel.
asked the bell boy if hed take me and my monkey as well.
he looked in the passenger seat of my car.
and with a smile he said.
if your monkeys got that kind of money sir.
then we have got a monkey bed.

me and my monkey.
with a dream and a gun.
hoping my monkey.
do not point that gun at anyone.
me and my monkey.
like butch and the sundance kid.
trying to understand.
why he did what he did.
why he did what he did.

and at the elevator i hit the 33rd floor.
he had a room up top with a panoramic views.
like nothing you have ever seen before.
he went to sleep in the bidet and when he awoke.
he ran his little monkey fingers through the yellow pages.
called up escort services and ordered some okey doke.
forty minutes later there came a knock at the door.
in walked this big, bad ass baboon into my bedroom.
with 3 monkey whores.
hi, my name is sunshine. these are my girls.
lace my palm with silver baby oh yeah.
and they will rock your world.
so i watched pay per view and polished my shoes and my gun.
was diggin old kurt cobain singing bout lithium.
there came and knocked at the door and in walked sunshine.

your monkey is having too much of a good time.

me and my monkey.
drove in search of the sun.
me and my monkey.
do not point that gun at anyone.
me and my monkey.
like billy the kid.
trying to understand.
why he did what he did.
why he did what he did.

the monkey was high.
said it was a burning ambition to see her before he died.
we left before encores.
he could not sit still.
sheena was a blast baby.
but my monkey was ill.
we went to play black jack.
kept hitting 23.
could not help but notice this mexican just staring at me.
or was it my monkey?
i could not be sure.
its not like you have never seen a monkey in rollerblades.
and dungarees before.
now do not test my patience cause we are not about to run.

i have been chasing you for a long time amigos.
and now your monkey is gonna die.

me and my monkey.
drove in search of the sun.
me and my monkey.
we do not wanna kill no mexican.
but we got ten itchy fingers.
one thing to declare.
when the monkey is high.
