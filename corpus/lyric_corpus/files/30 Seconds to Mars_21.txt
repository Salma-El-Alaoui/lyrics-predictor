i have been thinking of everything.
i used to want to be.
i have been thinking of everything.
of me, of you and me.

this is the story of my life.
these are the lies i have created.

i am in the middle of nothing.
and its where i want to be.
i am at the bottom of everything.
and i finally start to leave.

this is the story of my life.
these are the lies i have created.
i created.

and i swear to god.
i have found myself.
in the end.
in the end.

this is the story of my life.
these are the lies i have created.
