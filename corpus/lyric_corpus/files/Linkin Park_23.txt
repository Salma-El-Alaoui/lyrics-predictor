this is my december.
this is my time of the year.
this is my december.
this is all so clear.

this is my december.
this is my snow covered home.
this is my december.
this is me all alone.

and i.
just wish that i did not feel like there was something i missed.
and i.
take back all the things i said to make you feel like that.

give it all away, just to have somewhere to go to.
give it all away, to have someone to come home to.

this is my december.
