the sweet smell of a great sorrow lies over the land.
plumes of smoke rise and merge into the leaden sky.
a man lies and dreams of green fields and rivers.
but awakes to a morning with no reason for waking.

hes haunted by the memory of a lost paradise.
in his youth or a dream, he can not be precise.
hes chained forever to a world thats departed.
its not enough, its not enough.

his blood has frozen  curdled with fright.
his knees have trembled  given way in the night.
his hand has weakened at the moment of truth.
his step has faltered.

one world, one soul.
time pass, the river rolls.
and he talks to the river of lost love and dedication.
and silent replies that swirl invitation.
flow dark and troubled to an oily sea.
a grim intimation of what is to be.

theres an unceasing wind that blows through this night.
and theres dust in my eyes, that blinds my sight.
and silence that speaks so much louder that words.
of promises broken.
