so tired of broken hearts and losing at this game.
before i start this dance.
i will take a chance in telling you.
i want more than just romance.
you are my destiny.
i can not let go    baby, can not you see?
cupid please take your aim at me.

cherish the thought.
of always having you here by my side.
oh baby i cherish the joy.
you keep bringing it into my life i am always singing it.
cherish your strength.
you got the power to make me feel good.
and baby i perish the thought.
of ever leaving, i never would.

i was never satisfied with casual encounters.
i can not hide my need for two hearts that bleed with burning love.
thats the way its got to be.
romeo and juliet, they never felt this way i bet.
so do not underestimate my point of view.
