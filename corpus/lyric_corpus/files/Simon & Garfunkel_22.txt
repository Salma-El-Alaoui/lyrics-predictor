i am sitting in the railway station.
got a ticket for my destination.
on a tour of one night stands.
my suitcase and guitar in hand.
and every stop is neatly planned.
for a poet and a one man band.

homeward bound.
i wish i was.
homeward bound.
home, where my thoughts escaping.
home, where my musics playing.
home, where my love lies waiting.
silently for me.

everydays an endless stream.
of cigarettes and magazines.
and each town looks the same to me.
the movies and the factories.
and every strangers face i see.
reminds me that i long to be.

homeward bound.
i wish i was.
homeward bound.
home, where my thoughts escaping.
home, where my musics playing.
home, where my love lies waiting.
silently for me.

tonight i will sing my songs again.
i will play the game and pretend.
but all my words come back to me.
in shades of mediocrity.
like emptiness in harmony.
i need someone to comfort me.

homeward bound.
i wish i was.
homeward bound.
home, where my thoughts escaping.
home, where my musics playing.
home, where my love lies waiting.
silently for me.
silently for me.
silently for me.
