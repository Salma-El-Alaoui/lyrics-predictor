uh, yeah.

why does it feel like night today?
something in heres not right today.
why am i so uptight today?
paranoias all i got left.
i dont know what stressed me first.
or how the pressure was fed.
but i know just what it feels like.
to have a voice in the back of my head.
its like a face that i hold inside.
a face that awakes when i close my eyes.
a face that watches everytime i lie.
a face that laughs everytime i fall.
and watches everything.
so, know that when its time to sink or swim.
that the face inside is hearing me.
right underneath my skin.

its like im paranoid looking over my back.
its like a whirlwind inside of my head.
its like i cant stop what im hearing within.
its like a face inside thats right beneath my skin.

hey, yo.
here we go again with the pain i feel isnt real.
but in my mind, i find myself in places with names but not faces.
my memory races at speeds.
hundred degrees.
my sould bleeds, devil mustve planted the seed.
now it feels like my backs against the wall.
im taking the fall.
whenever i call nobodys responding at all.
but i dont know who i can trust.
the screaming my name.
i need somebody to help me out of the frame.
all im trying to do is just master me.
all i want to do is smoke a blast to beat.
but something keeps talking to me.
consciously, responsibly, keeps haunting me from dusk til dawn.
everything has something for you.
that voice inside of your head got you projecting paranoia.
cold sweat shining on your face.
exposing your purpose.
and if i ripped off your skin id probably find another person.
theres nothing worse than trying to bring yourself on back from the dead.
so i advise you listen to that voice in the back of your head.

its like im paranoid looking over my back.
its like a whirlwind inside of my head.
its like i cant stop what im hearing within.
its like a face inside thats right beneath my skin.

the face inside is right beneath your skin.
the face inside is right beneath your skin.

the sun goes down.
i feel the light betray me.
the sun goes down.
its like im paranoid.
