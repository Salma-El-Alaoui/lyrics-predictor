no i would not give you false hope.
on this strange and mournful day.
but the mother and child reunion.
is only a motion away, oh, little darling of mine.

i can not for the life of me.
remember a sadder day.
i know they say let it be.
but it just do not work out that way.
and the course of a lifetime runs.
over and over again.

no i would not give you false hope.
on this strange and mournful day.
but the mother and child reunion.
is only a motion away, oh, little darling of mine.

i just can not believe its so.
though it seems strange to say.
i never been laid so low.
in such a mysterious way.
and the course of a lifetime runs.
over and over again.

but i would not give you false hope.
on this strange and mournful day.
when the mother and child reunion.
is only a motion away.

oh the mother and child reunion.
is only a motion away.
oh the mother and child reunion.
is only a moment away.
