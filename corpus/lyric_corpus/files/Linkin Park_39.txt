come on!

i woke up in a dream today.
to the cold of the static.
and put my cold feet on the floor.
forgot all about yesterday.
remembering i am pretending to be where i am not anymore.
a little taste of hypocrisy.
and i am left in the wake of the mistake.
slow to react.
even though you are so close to me.
you are still so distant, and i can not bring you back.

its true, the way i feel.
was promised by your face.
the sound of your voice.
painted on my memories.
even if you are not with me.
i am with you.
you, now i see, keeping everything inside.
with you.
you, now i see, even when i close my eyes.
with you.
you, now i see, keeping everything inside.
with you.
you, now i see, even when i close my eyes.
with you.
ughhhh!

i hit you and you hit me back.
and we fall to the floor.
the rest of the day stands still.
fine line between this and that.
but when things go wrong, i pretend the past is not real.
now i am trapped in this memory.
and i am left in the wake of the mistake.
slow to react.
even though you are close to me.
you are still so distant, and i can not bring you back.

its true, the way i feel.
was promised by your face.
the sound of your voice.
painted on my memories.
even if you are not with me.
i am with you.
you, now i see, keeping everything inside.
with you.
you, now i see, even when i close my eyes.
with you.
you, now i see, keeping everything inside.
with you.
you, now i see, even when i close my eyes.
ughhhh!

no.
i will not let you control my fate while i am holding the weight of.
the world on my concience.
no.
i will not just sit here and wait while you weighin your options.
you are makin a fool of me.
no.
you didnt dare to try and say you dont care.
and solemnly swear not to follow me there.
no.
it aint like me to beg on my knees.
or, please oh baby please.
thats not how i am doin things.
no.
no i am not upset, no i am not angry.
i know love is love and love sometimes, it pains me.
no.
with or without you, i will always be with you.
you will never forget me, i am keeping you with me.
no.
i will not let you take me to the end of my rope.
while you burn it and torture my soul.
no.
no i am not your puppet.
and no, no, no, i will not let you go.

no, no matter how far we have come.
i can not wait to see tomorrow.
no matter how far we have come.
i, i can not wait to see tomorrow.

with you.
you, now i see, keeping everything inside.
with you.
you, now i see, even when i close my eyes.
with you.
you, now i see, keeping everything inside.
with you.
you, now i see, even when i close my eyes.
ughhhhh!
