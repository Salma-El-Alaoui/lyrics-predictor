its cold outside.
it gets so hot in here.
and the boys and girls collide.
to the music in my ear.

hear the children crying.
and i know its time to go.
i hear the children crying.
take me home.

a painted face.
and i know we have not long.
we thought that we had the answers.
it was the questions we had wrong.

hear the children crying.
and i know its time to go.
i hear the children crying.
take me home.

sad song, sad song.
sad song, sad song.

la lah la la, la lah la la.
la lah la.
la lah la la la la.
la lah la la, lah lah la.

la lah la la, la lah la la.
la lah la.
la lah la la la la.
la lah la la, lah lah la.

same song, sad song.
same song, sad song.
oh, same, oh.

call out your name.
call out in shame.
call out your name.
call out.
you better call out.
call, call, call out.
