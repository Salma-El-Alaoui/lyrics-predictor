i swear that i can go on forever again.
please let me know that my one bad day will end.
i will go down as your lover, your friend.
give me your lips and with one kiss we begin.

are you afraid of being alone.
cause i am, i am lost without you.
are you afraid of leaving tonight.
cause i am, i am lost without you.

i will leave my room open till sunrise for you.
i will keep my eyes patiently focused on you.
where are you now i can hear footsteps i am dreaming.
and if you will, keep me from waking to believe this.

are you afraid of being alone.
cause i am, i am lost without you.
are you afraid of leaving tonight.
cause i am, i am lost without you.

are you afraid of being alone.
cause i am, i am lost without you.
are you afraid of leaving tonight.
cause i am, i am lost without you.
are you afraid of being alone.
cause i am, i am lost without you.
are you afraid of leaving tonight.
cause i am, i am lost without you.

i am lost without you.
i am lost without you.
i am lost without you.
i am lost without you.
i am lost without you.
