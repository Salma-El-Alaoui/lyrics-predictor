ooooh........
i know its been sometime.
i have had something on my mind.
you see i have not been the same.
since that cold november day.
we said we needed space.
but all we found was an empty place.
and the only things i have learned.
is that i need you desperately.
so here i am, and can you please tell me....ohh.

chorus.
where do broken hearts go.
can they find their way home.
back to the open arms of a love thats waiting there.
and if somebody loves you.
will not they always love you.
i look in your eyes.
and i know that you still care for me.
oooooooooooh.......

i have been around enough to know.
that dreams do not turn to gold.
and that there is no easy way.
no you just can not run away.
and what we had was so much more.
than we ever had before.
and no matter how i try.
you are always on my mind.
so here i am, and can you please tell me ohh.

chorus.
where do broken hearts go.
can they find their way home.
back to the open arms.
of a love thats waiting there for me.

now that i am here with you.
i will never let you go.
i look into your eyes.
and now i know, now i know ohh.

chorus.
where do broken hearts go.
can they find their way home.
back to the open arms of a love thats waiting there.
and if somebody loves you.
will not they always love you.
i look in your eyes.
and i know that you still care.

where do broken hearts go.
can they find their way home.
back to the open arms of a love thats waiting there.
and if somebody loves you.
will not they always love you.
i look in your eyes.
and i know that you still care for me.
for me..........
you still care..........for me.
