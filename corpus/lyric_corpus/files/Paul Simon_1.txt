the problem is all inside your head.
she said to me.
the answer is easy if you.
take it logically.
id like to help you in your struggle.
to be free.
there must be fifty ways.
to leave your lover.

she said its really not my habit.
to intrude.
furthermore, i hope my meaning.
will not be lost or misconstrued.
but i will repeat myself.
at the risk of being crude.
there must be fifty ways.
to leave your lover.
fifty ways to leave your lover.

chorus.
you just slip out the back, jack.
make a new plan, stan.
you do not need to be coy, roy.
just get yourself free.
hop on the bus, gus.
you do not need to discuss much.
just drop off the key, lee.
and get yourself free.

she said it grieves me so.
to see you in such pain.
i wish there was something i could do.
to make you smile again.
i said i appreciate that.
and would you please explain.
about the fifty ways.

she said why do not we both.
just sleep on it tonight.
and i believe in the morning.
you will begin to see the light.
and then she kissed me.
and i realized she probably was right.
there must be fifty ways.
to leave your lover.
fifty ways to leave your lover.

chorus.
