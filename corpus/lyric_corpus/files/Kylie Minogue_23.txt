i fell in love with you.
the moment that we met.
and till the end of time.
i never will forget.
i lose it every time i am close to you.
under your spell you know theres nothing i can do.

please stay my babe.
who knows when we will dance again.
do not want to know regret.
i will do all that i can just to get you.
to stay my babe.
who knows when we will dance again.
and i do not want to say goodbye.
but who knows where we will be after tonight.

theres nothing stopping us.
you do not have to go.
the night is young for us.
theres more we need to know.
i lose it every time i am close to you.
under your spell you know theres nothing i can do.

please stay my babe.
who knows when we will dance again.
do not want to know regret.
i will do all that i can just to get you.
to stay my babe.
who knows when we will dance again.
and i do not want to say goodbye.
but who knows where we will be after tonight.

i lose it every time i am close to you.
