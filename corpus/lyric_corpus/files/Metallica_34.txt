alright.
we are scanning the scene.
in the city tonight.
we are looking for you.
to start up a fight.
there is an evil feeling.
in our brains.
but it is nothing new.
you know it drives us insane.

running.
on our way.
hiding.
you will pay.
dying.
one thousand deaths.
running.
on our way.
hiding.
you will pay.
dying.
one thousand deaths.
searching.
seek and destroy.
searching.
seek and destroy.
searching.
seek and destroy.
searching.
seek and destroy.

there is no escape.
and that is for sure.
this is the end we will not take any more.
say goodbye.
to the world you live in.
you have always been taking.
but now your giving.

running.
on our way.
hiding.
you will pay.
dying.
one thousand deaths.
running.
on our way.
hiding.
you will pay.
dying.
one thousand deaths.
searching.
seek and destroy.
searching.
seek and destroy.
searching.
seek and destroy.
searching.
seek and destroy.

our brains are on fire.
with the feeling to kill.
and it will not go away.
until our dreams are fulfilled.
there is only one thing.
on our minds.
do not try running away.
cause you are the one we will find.

running.
on our way.
hiding.
you will pay.
dying.
one thousand deaths.
running.
on our way.
hiding.
you will pay.
dying.
one thousand deaths.
searching.
seek and destroy.
searching.
seek and destroy.
searching.
seek and destroy.
searching.
seek and destroy.
