i am sick of picking the pieces.
and second guessing my reasons.
why you do not trust me.
why must we do this to one another?

we are just passionate lovers.
with trouble under the covers.
nothing worse than when.
you know that its over.

i just need a little of your time.
a little of your time.
to say the words i never said.
i just need a little of your time.
a little of your time.
to show you that i am not dead.

please do not leave, stay in bed.
touch my body instead.
gonna make you feel it.
can you still feel it?
gonna make you feel it.
can you still feel it?

well i got nothing to hide.
dip down and come for a ride.
embrace a devil, so sly.
you cannot hear em coming.

cause my defenses are weak.
i have no breath left to speak.
so take the evidence.
and bury it somewhere.

i just need a little of your time.
a little of your time.
to say the words i never said.
i just need a little of your time.
a little of your time.
to show you that i am not dead.

please do not leave, stay in bed.
touch my body instead.
gonna make you feel it.
can you still feel it?
gonna make you feel it.
can you still feel it?

oh my, i do not mind.
being the other guy.
nice try, for these games.
i do not have the time.
if you want me, call me.
come and take a risk.
kiss me somewhere deep below the surface.

i just need a little of your time.
a little of your time.
to say the words i never said.
i just need a little of your time.
a little of your time.
to show you that i am not dead.

please do not leave, stay in bed.
touch my body instead.
gonna make you feel it.
can you still feel it?
gonna make you feel it.
can you still feel it?
gonna make you feel it.
can you still feel it?
gonna make you feel it.
can you still feel it?
