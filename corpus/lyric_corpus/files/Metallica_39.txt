by the last breath of the fourth winds blow.
better raise your ears.
the sound of hooves knocks at your door.
lock up your wife and children now.
its time to wield the blade.
for now you have got some company.

the horsemen are drawing nearer.
on the leather steeds they ride.
they have come to take your life.
on through the dead of night.
with the four horsemen ride.
or choose your fate and die.

you have been dying since the day you were born.
you know it has all been planned.
the quartet of deliverance rides.
a sinner once a sinner twice.
no need for confession now.
cause now you have got the fight of your life.

the horsemen are drawing nearer.
on the leather steeds they ride.
they have come to take your life.
on through the dead of night.
with the four horsemen ride.
or choose your fate and die.

time.
has taken its toll on you.
the lines that crack your face.
famine.
your body it has torn through.
withered in every place.
pestilence.
for what you have had to endure.
and what you have put others through.
death.
deliverance for you for sure.
there is nothing you can do.

so gather round young warriors now.
and saddle up your steeds.
killing scores with demon swords.
now is the death of doers of wrong.
swing the judgment hammer down.
safely inside armor blood guts and sweat.

the horsemen are drawing nearer.
on the leather steeds they ride.
they have come to take your life.
on through the dead of night.
with the four horsemen ride.
or choose your fate and die.
