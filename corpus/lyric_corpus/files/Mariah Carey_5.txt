when you love someone so deep.
that they become your life.
its easy to succumb to overwhelming fears inside.
blindly i imagined i could.
keep you under glass.
now i understand to hold you.
i must open up my hands and watch you rise.

spread you wings and prepare to fly.
for you have become a butterfly oooh.
fly abandonedly into the sun.
if you should return to me.
we truly were meant to be.
so spread your wings and fly.
butterfly.

i have learned that beauty has to flourish in the light.
wild horses run unbridled or their spirit dies.
you have given me the courage to be all that i can.
and i truly feel your heart will.
lead you back to me when you are.
ready to land.

spread you wings and prepare to fly.
for you have become a butterfly oooh.
fly abandonedly into the sun.
if you should return to me.
we truly were meant to be.
so spread your wings and fly.
butterfly.

i can not pretend these tears are not overflowing steadily.
i can not prevent this hurt from almost overtaking me.
but i will stand and say goodbye stand and say goodbye.
for you will never be mine.
until you know the way it feels to fly.

spread your wings and prepare to fly.
for you have become a butterfly oooh.
fly abandonedly into the sun fly to the sun.
if you should return to me i will know you are mine.
we truly were meant to be spread your wings and fly.
so spread your wings and fly.
butterfly my butterfly.

spread your wings and prepare to fly.
for you have become a butterfly.
fly abandonedly into the sun.
if you should return to me.
we truly were meant to be you and i.
so spread your wings and fly spread your wings and fly.
butterfly.

so flutter through the sky.
butterfly.

fly...

spread your wings and fly.
butterfly..
