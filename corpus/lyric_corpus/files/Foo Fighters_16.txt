hanging on.
here until i am gone.
i am right where i belong.
just hanging on.

even though.
watched you come and go.
how was i to know.
youd steal the show?

one day i will have enough to gamble.
i will wait to hear your final call.
bet it all.

hanging on.
here until i am gone.
right where i belong.
just hanging on.

even though.
i pass this time alone.
somewhere so unknown.
it heals the soul.

you ask for walls.
i will build them higher.
we will lie in shadows of them all.
id stand but they are much too tall.
and i fall.

chorus.
february stars.
floating in the dark.
temporary scars.
february stars.

repeat chorus 2x.
