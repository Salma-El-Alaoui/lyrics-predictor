i started a joke.
which started the whole world crying.
but i did not see.
that the joke was on me.
oh no.

i started to cry.
which started the whole world laughing.
oh, if id only seen.
that the joke was on me.

i looked at the skies.
running my hands over my eyes.
and i fell out of bed.
hurting my head from things that id said.

till i finally died.
which started the whole world living.
oh, if id only seen.
that the joke was on me.
