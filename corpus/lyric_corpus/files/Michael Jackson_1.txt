spoken intro .
you ever want something.
that you know you should not have.
the more you know you should not have it.
the more you want it.
and then one day you get it.
its so good too.
but its just like my girl.
when shes around me.
i just feel so good, so good.
but right now i just feel cold, so cold.
right down to my bones.
cause ooh...
aingt no sunshine when shes gone.
its not warm when shes away.
aingt no sunshine when shes gone.
and shes always gone too long.
anytime she goes away.

wonder this time where shes gone.
wonder if shes gone to stay.
aingt no sunshine when shes gone.
and this house just aingt no home.
anytime she goes away.

i know, i know, i know, i know.
i know, know, know, know, know.
i know, i know.
hey i ought to leave.
i ought to leave her alone.
aingt no sunshine when shes gone.

aingt no sunshine when shes gone.
only darkness every day.
aingt no sunshine when shes gone.
and this house just aingt no home.
anytime she goes away.
