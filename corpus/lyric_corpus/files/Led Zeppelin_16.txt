walking in the park just the other day, baby.
what do you, what do you think i saw?
crowds of people sitting on the grass with flowers in their hair said.
hey, boy, do you wanna score?
and you know how it is.
i really do not know what time it was, whoa oh oh.
so i asked them if i could stay awhile.

i did not notice but it had got very dark and i was really.
really out of my mind.
just then a policeman stepped up to me asked us if please, hey, would we care.
to all get in line, get in line.
well you know.
they asked us to stay for tea and have some fun, whoa oh oh.
he said that his friends would all drop by, ooh.

why do not you take a good look at yourself and describe what you see.
and baby, baby, baby, do you like it?
there you sit, sitting spare like a book on a shelf rusting.
ah, not trying to fight it.
you really do not care if they are coming, whoa oh oh.
i know that its all a state of mind, ooh.

if you go down in the streets today, baby, you better.
you better open your eyes, whoa oh yeah.
folk down there really do not care, really do not care, do not care, really do not.
which, which way the pressure lies.
so i have decided what i am gonna do now.
so i am packing my bags for the misty mountains, where the spirits go now.
over the hills where the spirits fly, ooh, ooh.
ooh, ooh.
ooh, ooh.
ooh, ooh.
i really do not know.
i really do not know.
