wendy, wendy what went wrong.
oh so wrong.
we went together for so long.

i never thought a guy could cry.
til you made it with another guy.
oh wendy, wendy left me alone.
hurt so bad.

wendy, wendy do not lose your head.
lose your head.
wendy do not believe a word he says.

i can not picture you with him.
his future looks awful dim.
oh wendy, wendy left me alone.
hurt so bad.

wendy i would not hurt you like that.
no no no.
i thought we had our love down pat.
guess i was wrong.

the farthest thing from my mind.
was the day that id wake up to find.
my wendy.
wendy left me alone.

wendy, wendy left me alone.
hurts so bad.
wendy, wendy left me alone.
hurts so bad.
wendy, wendy left me alone.
hurts so bad.
wendy, wendy....
