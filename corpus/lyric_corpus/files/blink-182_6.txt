home show, mom will not know.
run out the back door.
hes passed out on the floor.

third time, been caught twice.
forgive our neighbour bob.
i think he humped the dog.

but good things come to those who wait.
cause she laid me.
and mom and dad possess the key   instant slavery.
no need explain the plan no need to even bother.
i will pack my bags i swear i will run   wish my friends were 21.

white lies, blood shot eyes.
breath of alcohol, stole it from the mall.
hows chris marked with lipstick.
better call their fathers, sleeping with your daughters.

but good things come to those who wait.
cause she laid me.
and mom and dad possess the key   instant slavery.
no need explain the plan no need to even bother.
i will pack my bags i swear i will run   wish my friends were 21.

you do not belong, you left the kids to carry on.
you planned their fall.
too bad you are wrong, do not need a mom dad slave drive song.
i time bomb.

turn low the radio, i think i hear my dad.
yelling at the band.
