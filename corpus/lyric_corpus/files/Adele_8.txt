who wants to be right as rain.
its better when something is wrong.
you get excitement in your bones.
and everything you dos a game.
when night comes and you are on your own.
you can say quoti chose to be alonequot.
who wants to be right as rain.
its harder when you are on top.

cause when hard work do not pay off.
and i am tired there aingt no room in my bed.
as far as i am concerned.
so wipe that dirty smile off.
we will not be making up.
i have cried my heart out.
and now i have had enough of love.

who wants to be riding high.
when you will just crumble back on down.
you give up everything you are.
and even then you do not get far.
they make believe that everything.
is exactly what it seems.
but at least when you are at your worst.
you know how to feel things.

see when hard work do not pay off and i am tired.
there aingt no room in my bed.
as far as i am concerned.
so wipe that dirty smile off.
we will not be making up.
i have cried my heart out.
and now i have had enough of love.

go ahead and still my heart.
to make me cry again.
cause it will never hurt.
as much as it did then.
when we were both right.
and no one had blame.
but now i give up.
on this endless game.

cause who wants to be right as rain.
its better when something is wrong.
i get excitement in my bones.
even thought everythings a strain.
when night comes and i am on my own.
you should know i chose to be alone.
who wants to be right as rain.
its harder when you are on top.

cause when hard work do not pay off and i am tired.
there aingt no room in my bed.
as far as i am concerned.
so wipe that dirty smile off.
we will not be making up.
i have cried my heart out.
and now i have had enough of love.
