watch the sunrise.
say your goodbyes.
off we go.
some conversation.
no contemplation.
hit the road.

car overheats.
jump out of my seat.
on the side of the highway, baby.
our road is long.
your hold is strong.
please do not ever let go, oh no.

i know i do not know you.
but i want you so bad.
everyone has a secret.
oh, can they keep it?
oh no, they can not.

i am driving fast now.
do not think i know how to go slow.
where you at now.
i feel around.
there you are.

cool these engines.
calm these jets.
i ask you how hot can it get.
and as you wipe off beads of sweat.
slowly you say, i am not there yet.

i know i do not know you.
but i want you so bad.
everyone has a secret.
oh, can they keep it?
oh no, they can not.

i know i do not know you.
