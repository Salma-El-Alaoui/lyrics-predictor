green light, 7 eleven.
you stop in for a pack of cigarettes.
you do not smoke, do not even want to.
hey now, check your change.
dressed up like a car crash.
the wheels are turning but you are upside down.
you say when he hits you you do not mind.
because when he hurts you you feel alive.
oh now, is that what it is.

red light, grey morning.
you stumble out of a hole in the ground.
a vampire or a victim.
it depends on whos around.
you used to stay up to watch the adverts.
you could lip synch to the talk shows.
and if you look, you look through me.
and when you talk its not to me.
and when i touch you, you do not feel a thing.

if i could stay, then the night would give you up.
stay, and the day would keep its trust.
stay, and the night would be enough.

faraway, so close up with the static and the radio.
with satellite television you can go anywhere.
miami, new orleans, london, belfast and berlin.

and if you listen i can not call.
and if you jump, you just might fall.
and if you shout, i will only hear you.
if i could stay then the night would give you up.
stay then the day would keep its trust.
stay with the demons you drowned.
stay with the spirit i found.
stay and the night would be enough.

three oclock in the morning.
its quiet and theres no one around.
just the bang and the clatter as an angel runs to ground.
just the bang and the clatter as an angel hits the ground.
