first thing i remember, i was lying in my bed.
could not have been no more than one or two.
and i remember there was a radio.
coming from the room next door.
and my mother laughed the way some ladies do.
well its late in the evening.
and the musics seeping through.

the next thing i remember, i am walking down the street.
i am feeling all right, i am with my boys, i am with my troops, yeah.
and down along the avenue some guys are shooting pool.
and i heard the sound of acapella grooves, yeah.
singing late in the evening.
and all the girls out on the stoops, yeah.

then i learned to play some lead guitar.
i was underage in this funky bar.
and i stepped outside and smoked myself a j.
and when i come back to the room everybody just seemed to move.
and i turned my amp up loud and i began to play.
and it was late in the evening.
and i blew that room away.

the first thing i remember when you came into my life.
i said, i am gonna get that girl no matter what i do.
well i guess i have been in love before.
once or twice i have been on the floor.
but i never loved no one the way that i love you.
and it was late in the evening.
and all the music seeping through..
