i have lied to you.
the same way that i always do.
this is the last smile.
that i will fake for the sake of being with you.
everything falls apart, even the people who never frown eventually break down.
the sacrifice of hiding in a lie.
everything has to end, you will soon find we are out of time left to watch it all unwind.
the sacrifice is never knowing.

why i never walked away.
why i played myself this way.
now i see your testing me pushes me away.

i have tried like you.
to do everything you wanted to.
this is the last time.
i will take the blame for the sake of being with you.
everything falls apart, even the people who never frown eventually break down.
