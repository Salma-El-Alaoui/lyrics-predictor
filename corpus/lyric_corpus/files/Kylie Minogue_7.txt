come, come, come into my world.
will not you lift me up, up, high upon your love.

take these arms that were made for loving.
and this heart that will beat for two.
take these eyes that were meant for watching over you.
and i have been such a long time waiting.
for someone i can call my own.
i have been chasing the life i am dreaming.
now i am home.

i need your love.
like night needs morning.

so will not you...
come, come, come into my world.
will not you lift me up, up, high upon your love.
oh baby come, come into my world.
will not you lift me up, up, high upon your love.

take these lips that were made for kissing.
and this heart that will see you through.
and these hands that were made to touch and feel you.

so free your love.
hear me i am calling.

oh will not you...
come, come, come into my world.
will not you lift me up, up, high upon your love.
oh baby.
come, come, come into my world.
will not you lift me up, up, high upon your love.
na, na, na, na....

i need your love.
like night needs morning.

oh will not you...
come, come, come into my world.
will not you lift me up, up, high upon your love.
come, come, come into my world.
will not you lift me up, up, high upon your love.
na, na, na, na.....
