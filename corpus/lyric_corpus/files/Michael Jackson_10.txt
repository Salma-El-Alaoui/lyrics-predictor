all you gotta do is just walk away and pass me by.
do not acknowledge my smile when i try to say hello to you yeah.
and all you gotta do is not answer my calls when.
i am trying to get through.
to keep me wondering why, when all i can do is sigh.
i just wanna touch you.

chorus.
i just wanna touch and kiss and i wish that i could be with you.
tonight cause you give me butterflys inside inside and i.




all i gotta say is that i must be dreaming, can not be real.
you are not here with me, still i can feel you near me.
i caress you, let you taste us, just so blissful listen.
i would give you anything baby, just make my dreams come true.
oh baby you give me butterflies inside.

chorus.


if you would take my hand, baby i would show you.
guide you to the light babe.
if you would be my love, baby i will love you, love you.
til the end of time.


chorus 2x.
