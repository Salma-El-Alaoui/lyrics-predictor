women think i am tasty, but they are always trying to waste me.
and make me burn the candle right down.
but baby, baby, do not need no jewels in my crown.

cause all you women is low down gamblers.
cheating like i do not know how.
but baby, i go crazy, theres fever in the funk house now.

this low down bitching got my poor feet a itching.
you know you know the deuce is still wild.
baby, can not stay.
you got to roll me and call me the tumbling dice.

always in a hurry, i never stop to worry.
do not you see the time flashing by.
honey, got no money, i am all sixes and sevens and nines.

say now, baby, i am the rank outsider.
you can be my partner in crime.
baby, can not stay.
you got to roll me and call me the tumbling.
roll me and call me the tumbling dice.

oh my my my, i am the lone crap shooter.
playing the field every night.
baby, can not stay.
you got to roll me and call me the tumbling.
roll me and call me the tumbling dice.

got to roll me.
got to roll me.
got to roll me.
got to roll me.
got to roll me.
got to roll me.
got to roll me.
keep on rolling.
got to roll me.
keep on rolling.
got to roll me.
keep on rolling.
got to roll me.
got to roll me.
got to roll me.
got to roll me.
got to roll me.
got to roll me.
got to roll me.
got to roll me.
