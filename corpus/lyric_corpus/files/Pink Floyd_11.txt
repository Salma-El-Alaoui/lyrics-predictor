hello.
is there anybody in there?
just nod if you can hear me.
is there anyone home?

come on, now.
i hear you are feeling down.
well i can ease your pain.
get you on your feet again.

relax.
i need some information first.
just the basic facts.
can you show me where it hurts?

there is no pain, you are receding.
a distant ships smoke on the horizon.
you are only coming through in waves.
your lips move but i can not hear what you are saying.
when i was a child i had a fever.
my hands felt just like two balloons.
now i got that feeling once again.
i can not explain, you would not understand.
this is not how i am.
i have become comfortably numb.

ok.
just a little pinprick.
there will be no more   aaaaaahhhhh!
but you may feel a little sick.

can you stand up?
i do believe its working. good.
that will keep you going for the show.
come on its time to go.

there is no pain, you are receding.
a distant ships smoke on the horizon.
you are only coming through in waves.
your lips move but i can not hear what you are saying.
when i was a child i caught a fleeting glimpse.
out of the corner of my eye.
i turned to look but it was gone.
i cannot put my finger on it now.
the child is grown, the dream is gone.
i have become comfortably numb..
