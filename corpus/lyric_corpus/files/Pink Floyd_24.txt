film if you will just let me know as soon as you can ... mrs bancroft... mrs bancroft ...

film i do not understand ...
are you feeling okay?

day after day, love turns grey.
like the skin on a dying man.
and night after night.
we pretend its all right.
but i have grown older.
and you have grown colder.
and nothing is very much fun anymore.
and i can feel.
one of my turns coming on.
i feel cold as a razor blade.
tight as a tourniquet.
dry as a funeral drum.

run to the bedroom.
in the suitcase on the left.
you will find my favorite axe.
do not look so frightened.
this is just a passing phase.
one of my bad days.
would you like to watch tv?
or get between the sheets?
or contemplate the silent freeway?
would you like something to eat?
would you like to learn to fly?    would you?
would you like to see me try?

would you like to call the cops?
do you think its time i stopped?
why are you running away?
