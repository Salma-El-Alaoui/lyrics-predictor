no more champagne.
and the fireworks are through.
here we are, me and you.
feeling lost and feeling blue.
its the end of the party.
and the morning seems so grey.
so unlike yesterday.
nows the time for us to say.

happy new year.
happy new year.
may we all have a vision now and then.
of a world where every neighbour is a friend.
happy new year.
happy new year.
may we all have our hopes, our will to try.
if we do not we might as well lay down and die.
you and i.

sometimes i see.
how the brave new world arrives.
and i see how it thrives.
in the ashes of our lives.
oh yes, man is a fool.
and he thinks he will be okay.
dragging on, feet of clay.
never knowing hes astray.
keeps on going anyway.

happy new year.
happy new year.
may we all have a vision now and then.
of a world where every neighbour is a friend.
happy new year.
happy new year.
may we all have our hopes, our will to try.
if we do not we might as well lay down and die.
you and i.

seems to me now.
that the dreams we had before.
are all dead, nothing more.
than confetti on the floor.
its the end of a decade.
in another ten years time.
who can say what we will find.
what lies waiting down the line.
in the end of eighty nine.

happy new year.
happy new year.
may we all have a vision now and then.
of a world where every neighbour is a friend.
happy new year.
happy new year.
may we all have our hopes, our will to try.
if we do not we might as well lay down and die.
you and i.
