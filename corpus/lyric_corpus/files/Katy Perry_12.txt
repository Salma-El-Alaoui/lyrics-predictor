verse 1.
i hope you hang yourself with your hampm scarf.
while jacking off listening to mozart.
you bitch and moan about la.
wishing you were in the rain reading hemingway.
you don??t eat meat.
and drive electrical cars.
you??re so indie rock it??s almost an art.
you need spf 45 just to stay alive.

you??re so gay and you don??t even like boys.
no you don??t even like.
no you don??t even like.
no you don??t even like boys.
you??re so gay and you don??t even like boys.
no you don??t even like.
no you don??t even like.
no you don??t even like?

verse 2.
you??re so sad maybe you should buy a happy meal.
you??re so skinny you should really super size the deal.
secretly you??re so amused.
