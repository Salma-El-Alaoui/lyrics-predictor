come in here, dear boy, have a cigar.
you are gonna go far.
you are gonna fly high.
you are never gonna die.
you are gonna make it if you try.
they are gonna love you.
i have always had a deep respect and i mean that most sincere.
the band is just fantastic, that is really what i think.
oh, by the way, which ones pink?

and did we tell you the name of the game, boy?
we call it riding the gravy train.

we are just knocked out.
we heard about the sell out.
you are gonna get an album out.
you owe it to the people.
we are so happy we can hardly count.
everybody else is just green.
have you seen the chart?
its a hell of a start.
it could be made into a monster.
if we all pull together as a team.

and did we tell you the name of the game, boy?
we call it riding the gravy train..
