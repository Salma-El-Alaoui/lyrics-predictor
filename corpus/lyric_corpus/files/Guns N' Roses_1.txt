i try and feel the sunshine.
you bring the rain.
you try and hold me down.
with your complaints.
you cry and moan and complain.
you whine an tear.
up to my neck in sorrow.
the touch you bring.
you just do not step inside to.
14 years.
so hard to keep my own head...
thats what i say.
you know...i have been the beggar...
i have played the thief.
i was the dog...they all tried to beat.

but its been.
14 years of silence.
its been.
14 years of pain.
its been.
14 years that are gone forever.
and i will never have again.

your stupid girlfriends tell you.
that i am to blame.
well they are all used up has beens.
out of the game.
this time i will have the last word.
you hear what i say.
i tried to see it your way.
it will not work today.
you just do not step inside to.
14 years.
so hard to keep my own head...
thats what i say.
you know...i have been the dealer...
hanging on your street.
i was the dog...they all tried to beat.

but its been.
14 years of silence.
its been.
14 years of pain.
its been.
14 years that are gone forever.
and i will never have again.

bullshit and contemplation.
gossips their trade.
if they knew half the real truth.
what would they say.
well i am past the point of concern.
its time to play.
these last 4 years of madness.
sure put me straight.
do not get back 14 years.
in just one day.
so hard to keep my own head.
just go away.
you know...just like a hooker she said.
nothings for free.
oh i tried to see it your way.
i tried to see it your way.
