when i look back.
boy, i must have been green.
bopping in the country.
fishing in a stream.

looking for an answer.
trying to find a sign.
until i saw your city lights.
honey, i was blind.

they said, get back, honky cat.
better get back to the woods.
well, i quit those days and my redneck ways.
and oh, oh, oh, oh, the change is gonna do me good.

you better get back, honky cat.
living in the city aingt where its at.
its like trying to find gold in a silver mine.
its like trying to drink whisky from a bottle of wine.

well i read some books and i read some magazines.
about those high class ladies.
down in new orleans.
and all the folks back home, well, they said i was a fool.
they said, oh, believe in the lord.
is the golden rule.

they said stay at home, boy, you gotta tend the farm.
living in the city, boy.
is gonna break your heart.
but how can you stay when your heart says no?
how can you stop when your feet say go?
