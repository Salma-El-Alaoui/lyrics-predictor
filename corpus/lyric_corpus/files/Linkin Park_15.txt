i do not know who to trust, no surprise.
everyone feels so far away from me.
heavy thoughts sift through dust and the lies.

trying not to break but i am so tired of this deceit.
every time i try to make myself get back upon my feet.
all i ever think about is this, all the tiring time between.
and how trying to put my trust in you just takes so much out of me.

i take everything from the inside.
and throw it all away.
because i swear for the last time.
i will not trust myself with you.

tension is building inside steadily.
everyone feels so far away from me.
heavy thoughts forcing their way out of me.

trying not to break but i am so tired of this deceit.
every time i try to make myself get back upon my feet.
all i ever think about is this, all the tiring time between and how.
trying to put my trust in you just takes so much out of me.

i take everything from the inside.
and throw it all away.
because i swear for the last time.
i will not trust myself with you.

i will not waste myself on you.
i will not waste myself on you.

i will take everything from the inside.
and throw it all away.
because i swear for the last time.
i will not trust myself with you.

everything from the inside.
and just throw it all away.
because i swear for the last time.
