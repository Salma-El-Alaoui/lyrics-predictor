cmon ...

up in the morning and out to school.
the teacher is teaching the golden rule.
american history and practical maths.
you studying hard and you are hoping to pass.
ooh you are working your fingers right down to the bone.
and the guy behind you will not leave you alone.

ring ring goes the bell.
the cook in the kitchen is ready to sell.
but you are lucky if you can find a seat.
you are fortunate if you got time to eat.
well back in the classroom open your books.
ooh the teacher do not know how mean she looks.

hail hail rock n roll, hail hail rock n roll.
hail hail rock n roll, hail hail rock n roll.
hail hail rock n roll, hail hail rock n roooooll.

as soon as 3 oclock goes around.
you finally lay your burden down.
throw down your books and outta your seat.
you go down the hallway into the street.
and you are trying to forget just where you have been.
you find a juke joint, you go in.

you drop the quarter right into the slot.
you gotta hear something thats really hot, like me.
with the one you love you are making romance.
all day long they wanted to dance.
and you are feeling the music from head to toe.
as round and round and round you go.
get over here.

long live rock n roll, long live rock n roll.
long live rock n roll, long live rock n roll.
long live rock n roll, long live rock n roll, hey.

rock, rock, rock n roll, rock, rock, rock n roll.
rock, rock, rock n roll, rock, rock, rock n roll.
rock, rock, rock n roll, rock, rock, rock n roll, cmon.

rock, rock, rock n roll, rock, rock, rock n roll.
rock, rock, rock n roll, rock, rock, rock n roll.
rock, rock, rock n roll, rock, rock, rock n roll.
