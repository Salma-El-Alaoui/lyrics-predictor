i have seen you twice.
in a short time.
only a week since we started.
it seems to be.
for every time.
i am getting more open hearted.

i was an impossible case.
no one ever could reach me.
but i think i can see in your face.
theres a lot you can teach me.
so i wanna know.

whats the name of the game.
does it mean anything to you.
whats the name of the game.
can you feel it the way i do.

tell me please.
cause i have to know.
i am a bashful child.
beginning to grow.

and you make me talk.
and you make me feel.
and you make me show.
what i am trying to conceal.
if i trust in you.
would you let me down.
would you laugh at me.
if i said i cared for you.
could you feel the same way too.
i wanna know.

the name of the game.
your smile and the sound of your voice.
does it mean anything to you.
does not mean any pivotal choice.
but it means a lot.
