yeah.

lover, i am on the street.
gonna go where the bright lights.
and the big city meet.
with a red guitar...on fire.
desire.

shes a candle burning in my room.
yeah i am like the needle, needle and spoon.
over the counter with a shotgun.
pretty soon everybody got one.
and the fever when i am beside her.
desire, desire...

and the fever...getting higher.
desire, desire...burning, burning.

shes the dollars.
shes my protection.
yeah shes a promise.
in the year of election.
oh sister, i can not let you go.
like a preacher stealing hearts.
at a traveling show.
for love or money money money.
money money money money money.
money money money.
and the fever, getting higher.
desire, desire, desire, desire.
desire, desire.
