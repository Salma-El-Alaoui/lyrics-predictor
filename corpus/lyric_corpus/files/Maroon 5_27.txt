if i be so inclined to climb up beside you.
would you tell me that the time just isnt right?
and if i ever find the key you hide so well.
will you tell me that i can spend the night?

leavin your smell on my coat, leavin your taste on my shoulder.
i still fail to understand what it is about this woman.

if i could bottle up the chills that you give me.
i would keep them in a jar next to my bed.
and if i should ever draw a picture of a woman.
it is you that would come flowing from my pen.

leavin your clothes on the floor, making me walk out the door.
and i still fail to understand what it is about this woman.

helplessly melting as i stand next to the sun.
as she burns me, i am screaming out for more.
drink every drop of liquid heat that i have become.
pop me open, spoon me out on to the floor.

leavin your smell on my coat, leavin your taste on my shoulder.
i still fail to understand, fail to understand.
leavin your smell on my coat, leavin your taste on my shoulder.
i still fail to understand what it is about this woman..
