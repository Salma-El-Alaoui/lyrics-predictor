forfeit the game.
before somebody else.
takes you out of the frame.
puts your name to shame.
cover up your face.
you can not run the race.
the pace is too fast.
you just will not last.

you love the way i look at you.
while taking pleasure in the awful things you put me through.
you take away if i give in.
my life, my pride is broken.

you like to think you are never wrong.
you live what you have learned.
you have to act like you are someone.
you live what you have learned.
you want someone to hurt like you.
you live what you have learned.
you want to share what you have been through.
you live what you have learned.

you love the things i say i will do.
the way i will hurt myself again just to get back at you.
you take away when i give in.
my life, my pride is broken.
