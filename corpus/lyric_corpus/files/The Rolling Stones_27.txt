she would never say where she came from.
yesterday do not matter if its gone.
while the sun is bright.
or in the darkest night.
no one knows.
she comes and goes.

goodbye, ruby tuesday.
who could hang a name on you?
when you change with every new day.
still i am gonna miss you.

do not question why she needs to be so free.
she will tell you its the only way to be.
she just can not be chained.
to a life where nothings gained.
and nothings lost.
at such a cost.

goodbye, ruby tuesday.
who could hang a name on you?
when you change with every new day.
still i am gonna miss you.

theres no time to lose, i heard her say.
catch your dreams before they slip away.
dying all the time.
lose your dreams.
and you will lose your mind.
aingt life unkind?

goodbye, ruby tuesday.
who could hang a name on you?
when you change with every new day.
still i am gonna miss you.

goodbye, ruby tuesday.
who could hang a name on you?
when you change with every new day.
still i am gonna miss you.
