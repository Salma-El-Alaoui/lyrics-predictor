this is the first thing i remember.
now its the last thing left on my mind.
afraid of the dark do you hear me whisper.
an empty heart replaced with paranoia.
where do we go lifes temporary.
after we are gone like new years resolutions.
why is this hard do you recognize me.
i know i am wrong but i can not help believing.
i am so lost.
i am barely here.
i wish i could explain myself.
but words escape me.
its too late.
to save me.
you are too late.
you are too late.

you are cold with disappointment.
while i am drowning in the next room.
the last contagious victim of this plague between us.
i am sick with apprehension.
i am crippled from exhaustion.
and i dread the moment when you finally come to kill me.

this is the first thing i remember.
now its the last thing left on my mind.
afraid of the dark do you hear me whisper.
an empty heart replaced with paranoia.
where do we go lifes temporary.
after we are gone like new years resolutions.
why is this hard do you recognize me.
i know i am wrong but i can not help believing.
