chestnuts roasting on an open fire.
jack frost nipping at your nose.
yuletide carols being sung by a choir.
and folks all dressed up like eskimos.
everybody knows that turkey and some mistletoe.
will help to make the season bright.
and tiny tots with their eyes all a glow.
will find it hard to sleep tonight.

they know that santas on his way.
hes loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh.
and every mothers child is gonna spy.
to see if reindeer really know how to fly.
and so i am offering this simple phrase.
to kids from one to ninety two.
although its been said many times, many ways.
merry christmas, merry christmas.

merry christmas.
to you.
