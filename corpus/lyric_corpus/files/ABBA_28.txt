summer night city...
summer night city...

waiting for the sunrise.
soul dancing in the dark.
summer night city.

walking in the moonlight.
love making in the park.
summer night city.

in the sun i feel like sleeping.
i can not take it for too long.
my impatience slowly creeping.
up my spine and growing strong.

i know whats waiting there for me.
tonight i am loose and fancy free.

when the night comes with the action.
i just know its time to go.
ca not resist the strange attraction.
from that giant dynamo.
lots to take and lots to give.
time to breathe and time to live.

waiting for the sunrise.
soul dancing in the dark.
summer night city.

walking in the moonlight.
love making in the park.
summer night city.

its elusive call it glitter.
somehow something turns me on.
some folks only see the litter.
we do not miss them when they are gone.

i love the feeling in the air.
my kind of people everywhere.

when the night comes with the action.
i just know its time to go.
ca not resist the strange attraction.
from that giant dynamo.

and tomorrow, when its dawning.
and the first birds start to sing.
in the pale light of the morning.
nothings worth remembering.

its a dream, its out of reach.
scattered driftwood on the beach.

waiting for the sunrise.
soul dancing in the dark.
summer night city.

walking in the moonlight.
love making in the park.
summer night city repeat 2x and fade.
