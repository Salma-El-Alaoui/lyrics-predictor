you will take my life but i will take yours too.
you will fire your musket but i will run you through.
so when you are waiting for the next attack.
youd better stand theres no turning back.

the bugle sounds and the charge begins.
but on this battlefield no one wins.
the smell of acrid smoke and horses breath.
as i plunge on into certain death.

the horse he sweats with fear we break to run.
the mighty roar of the russian guns.
and as we race towards the human wall.
the screams of pain as my comrades fall.

we hurdle bodies that lay on the ground.
and the russians fire another round.
we get so near yet so far away.
we were meant to fight another day.

we get so close near enough to fight.
when a russian gets me in his sights.
he pulls the trigger and i feel the blow.
a burst of rounds take my horse below.

and as i lay there gazing at the sky.
my bodys numb and my throat is dry.
and as i lay forgotten and alone.
without a tear i draw my parting groan.
