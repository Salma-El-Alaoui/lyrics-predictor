five oclock in the morning you aingt home.
i can not help thinking thats strange.
baby i just want you to know i will not go through this again.
yes, those clouds are closing in.

chorus.
and i will not accept this as a part of my life.
i will not live in fear of what may be.
and the lessons that i learned.
i would rather be alone than watch you spinning that wheel for me.
you have got a thing about danger.
aingt you getting what you want from me.
you have got a thing about strangers.
baby thats what we used to be.
you have got a thing about danger baby.
i guess the hungry just can not see.
one of these days you gonna bring some home to me.

six oclock in the morning you aingt home.
i can not help thinking its strange.
it seems that everybody takes their chances these days.
oh yeah, we are standing in the rain.

chorus.

how can you love me when you are playing with my life.
you say give me time and i will do better i swear.
give me time and i will lead you back to despair.
and i do not want to go back there.
