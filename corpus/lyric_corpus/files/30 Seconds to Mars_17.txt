until you crash.
until you burn.
until you lie.
until you learn.
until you see.
until you believe.

until you fight.
until you fall.
until the end of everything at all.
until you die.
until you are alive.

do not save me, do not save me, cuz i do not care.
do not save me, do not save me, cuz.
i do not care.

until you give.
until you have used.
until you have lost.
until you lose.
until you see, how could you believe?

until you have lived a thousand times.
until you have seen the other side.
this is my chance, this is my chance.

do not save me, do not save me, cuz i do not care.
do not save me, do not save me, cuz.
i do not care.

until the truth becomes a lie.
until you change, until you deny.
until you believe.

this is my chance, this is my chance.
i will take it now because i can.
this is my chance, i want it now.

do not save me, do not save me, cuz i do not care.
do not save me, do not save me, cuz.
i do not care.

save me, save me, save me.
save me, save me, save me.
i do not care.
