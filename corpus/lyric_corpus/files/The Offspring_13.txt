our lives run different ways.
through the rain i see you in the sun.
our star shines anyway.
if you wish upon it we are one.

1,2,3,4.

chorus.
dog eat dog.
every day.
on our fellow man we prey.
dog eat dog.
to get by.
hope you like my genocide.

i find it such a shame.
through the pain i see things as they are.
we are served up on a plate.
the pedestal is high enough to fall.
and if in time.
we can see the errors of our ways.
would anyone change it anyhow?
our time is up......

1,2,3,4.
chorus x2.

i bet youd only run.
if you saw what goes inside our own.
i bet youd lead the way.
if it were up to you to decide.
but its not.

chorus x2.

like a silver flame.
like a suicide.
like killing boy.
1,2,3,4!
