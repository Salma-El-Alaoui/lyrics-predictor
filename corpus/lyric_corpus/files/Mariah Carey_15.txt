theres a hero.
if you look inside your heart.
you do not have to be afraid.
of what you are.
theres an answer.
if you reach into your soul.
and the sorrow that you know.
will melt away.

chorus.
and then a hero comes along.
with the strength to carry on.
and you cast your fears aside.
and you know you can survive.
so when you feel like hope is gone.
look inside you and be strong.
and you will finally see the truth.
that a hero lies in you.

its a long road.
when you face the world alone.
no one reaches out a hand.
for you to hold.
you can find love.
if you search within yourself.
and the emptiness you felt.
will disappear.

 chorus.
and then a hero comes along.
with the strength to carry on.
and you cast your fears aside.
and you know you can survive.
so when you feel like hope is gone.
look inside you and be strong.
and you will finally see the truth.
that a hero lies in you.

lord knows.
dreams are hard to follow.
but do not let anyone.
tear them away.
hold on.
there will be tomorrow.
in time.
you will find the way.
