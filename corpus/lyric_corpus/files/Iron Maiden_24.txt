i remember it as plain as day.
although it happened in the dark of the night.
i was strolling through the streets of paris.
and it was cold it was starting to rain.
and then i heard a piercing scream.
and i rushed to the scene of the crime.
but all i found was the butchered remains.
of two girls lay side by side.

murders in the rue morgue.
someone call the gendarmes.
murders in the rue morgue.
run before the killers go free.

theres some people coming down the street.
at last theres someone heard my call.
i can not understand why they are pointing at me.
i never done nothing at all.
but i must have got some blood on my hands.
because everyones shouting at me.
i can not speak french so i could not explain.
and like a fool i started running away.

i have gotta find my way across the border for sure.
down the south to italy.

well i made it to the border at last.
but i can not erase the scene from my mind.
anytime somebody stares at me, well.
i just start running blind.
well i am moving through the shadows at night.
away from the staring eyes.
any day they will be looking for me.
cause i know i show the signs of...

i am running out of places to hide.
