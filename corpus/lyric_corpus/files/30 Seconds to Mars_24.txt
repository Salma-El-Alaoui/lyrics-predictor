and so the time has come, its here.
the silence ends, a change is near.

you wait in the palid slivered sky.
come into the pantheon.

welcome to the universe.
welcome to the universe.

if theres a past into the clear.
we better take the pace.
erase this face.
in constant search for everything.

you wait in the palid slivered sky.
come into the pantheon.

welcome to the universe.
welcome to the universe.
welcome to the universe.
welcome to the universe.

a new day has begun.
