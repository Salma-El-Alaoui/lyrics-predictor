its so hot in here.

oh, its so hot and i need some air.
and boy, do not stop cause i am halfway there.

its not complicated.
we are too syncopated.
we can read each others minds.
one love invited, two bodies sychronizing.
do not even need to touch me, baby.

just...

  chorus  .
breathe on me.
yeah, oh baby, just.
breathe on me.
we do not need to touch just.
breathe.

oh, yeah.

oh, this is way beyond the physical way beyond the physical.
tonight, my senses do not make sense at all.

our imagination taking us to places.
we have never been before.
take me in, let it out.
do not even need to touch me, baby.

just...

  chorus x2 .

oh.
monogamy is the way to go.
just put your lips together.
and blow.

breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe x4.

  chorus x2  .
