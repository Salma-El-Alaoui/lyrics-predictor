one shot all i need.
i have got rhythm when i bleed.

til death do us part.
break my heart so i can start.

supercalifragilistic.
kiss me in the futuristic.
twisted but i must insist.
its time to get on top of this.

its right on time.
its right on time.
its right on time.
its right on time its right on time its right on time.
its right on time.
lookin fine you are lookin fine get on 1999.
its right on time.

discard to bombard.
calling all you shooting stars.

holy cow bow wow wow.
now i am here i am nowhere now.

joan of arc reincarnated.
maybe we could be related.
so much blood to circulate.
and so much space to decorate.

its right on time.
its right on time.
its right on time.
its right on time its right on time its right on time.
its right on time.
lookin fine you are lookin fine get on 1999.
its right on time.

plain and simple pain.
i want to but i can not complain.

death row let us go.
its time to blow up for show.

all the world reverberated.
coming through we motorcaded.
vibrate when we operated.
turing up in solid stated.

oh lord.
