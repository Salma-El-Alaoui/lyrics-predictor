spoken.
watch out!

i see you on the street and you walk on by.
you make me wanna hang my head down and cry.
if you gave me half a chance youd see.
my desire burning inside of me.
but you choose to look the other way.
i have had to work much harder than this.
for something i want do not try to resist me.

chorus.

open your heart to me, baby.
i hold the lock and you hold the key.
open your heart to me, darling.
i will give you love if you, you turn the key.

i think that you are afraid to look in my eyes.
you look a little sad boy, i wonder why.
i follow you around but you can not see.
you are too wrapped up in yourself to notice.
so you choose to look the other way.
well, i have got something to say.
do not try to run i can keep up with you.
nothing can stop me from trying, you have got to.

chorus.

open your heart with the key.
one is such a lonely number.

ah, ah, ah, ah.
open your heart, i will make you love me.
its not that hard, if you just turn the key.

do not try to run i can keep up with you.
nothing can stop me from trying, you have got to.

chorus.

open your heart with the key.

open your heart, i will make you love me.
its not that hard, if you just turn the key.
repeat and fade.
