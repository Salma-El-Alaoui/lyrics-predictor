wake ... from your sleep.
the drying of your tears.
today ... we escape.
we escape.

pack and get dressed.
before your father hears us.
before ... all hell ... breaks loose.

breathe ... keep breathing.
do not lose ... your nerve.
breathe ... keep breathing.
i can not do this ... alone.

sing us a song.
a song to keep us warm.
theres such a chill.
such a chill.

you can laugh.
a spineless laugh.
we hope your rules and wisdom choke you.
now we are one.
in everlasting peace.

we hope that you choke ... that you choke.
we hope that you choke ... that you choke.
we hope that you choke ... that you choke.
