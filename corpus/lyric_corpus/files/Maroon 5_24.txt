i was so high i did not recognize.
the fire burning in her eyes.
the chaos that controlled my mind.
whispered good bye as she got on a plane.
never to return again but always in my heart.

this love has taken its toll on me.
she said good bye too many times before.
and her heart is breaking in front of me.
i have no choice, cause i will not say goodbye anymore.

i tried my best to feed her appetite.
keep her coming every night.
so hard to keep her satisfied.
kept playing love like it was just a game.
pretending to feel the same.
then turn around and leave again, but uh oh.

this love has taken its toll on me.
she said good bye too many times before.
and her heart is breaking in front of me.
i have no choice, cause i will not say good bye anymore.

i will fix these broken things, repair your broken wings.
and make sure everythings all right.
its all right, its all right.
my pressure on your hips, i am sinking my fingertips.
into every inch of you.
cause i know thats what you want me to do.

this love has taken its toll on me.
she said good bye too many times before.
her heart is breaking in front of me.
i have no choice, cause i will not say good bye anymore.

this love has taken its toll on me.
she said good bye too many times before.
my heart is breaking in front of me.
i have no choice, cause i will not say good bye anymore.

this love has taken its toll on me.
she said goodbye too many times before.
her heart is breaking in front of me.
but i have no choice, cause i will not say goodbye anymore.
