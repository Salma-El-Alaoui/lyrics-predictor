when i was small, and christmas trees were tall.
we used to love while others used to play.
do not ask me why, but time has passed us by.
some one else moved in from far away.

chorus.
now we are tall, and christmas trees are small.
and you do not ask the time of day.
but you and i, our love will never die.
but guess we will cry come first of may.

the apple tree that grew for you and me.
i watched the apples falling one by one.
and i recall the moment of them all.
the day i kissed your cheek and you were mine.

chorus...

when i was small, and christmas trees were tall.
do do do do do do do do do...
do not ask me why, but time has passed us by.
some one else moved in from far away.
