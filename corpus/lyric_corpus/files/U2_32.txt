oh, the citys alight.
with lovers and lies.
and bright blue eyes.

oh, the city is bright.
its brighter than day tonight.

surrender, surrender.
surrender, surrender.

sadie said she could not work out what it was all about.
and so she let go.
now sadies on the street and the people she meets you know.

she tried to be a good girl and a good wife.
raise a good family.
lead a good life.
its not good enough.
she got herself up on the 48th floor.
gotta find out.
find out what shes living for.

surrender, surrender.
surrender, surrender.

oh, the citys a fire.
a passionate flame that knows me by name.
oh, the citys desire to take me for more and more.
its in the street getting under my feet.
its in the air, its everywhere i look for you.
its in the things that i do and say.
and it i wanna live i gotta die to myself someday.

oh, oh, oh, oh...

papa sing my sing my song.
papa sing my sing my song.
papa sing my sing my song.
