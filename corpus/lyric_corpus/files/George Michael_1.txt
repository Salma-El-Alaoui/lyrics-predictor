id say love was a magical flame.
id say love would keep us from pain.
had i been there, had i been there.

i would promise you all of my life.
but to lose you would cut like a knife.
so i do not dare, no i do not dare.

cause i have never come close in all of these years.
you are the only one to stop my tears.
and i am so scared, i am so scared.

take me back in time maybe i can forget.
turn a different corner and we never would have met.
would you care.

i do not understand it, for you its a breeze.
little by little you have brought me to my knees.
do not you care.

no i have never come close in all of these years.
you are the only one to stop my tears.
i am so scared of this love.

and if all that there is, is this fear of being used.
i should go back to being lonely and confused.
if i could, i would, i swear.
