young girl do not cry.
i will be right here when your world starts to fall.
young girl its alright.
your tears will dry, you will soon be free to fly.

when you are safe inside your room you tend to dream.
of a place where nothings harder than it seems.
no one ever wants or bothers to explain.
of the heartache life can bring and what it means.

when theres no one else.
look inside yourself.
like your oldest friend just.
trust the voice within.
then you will find the strength.
that will guide your way.
you will learn to begin to.
trust the voice within, ohh.

young girl do not hide.
you will never change if you just run away, ooh ohh.
young girl just hold tight.
soon you are gonna see your brighter day, ohh.

now in a world where innocence is quickly claimed.
its so hard to stand your ground when you are so afraid.
no one reaches out a hand for you to hold.
when you are lost outside, look inside to your soul.

when theres no one else.
look inside yourself.
like your oldest friend just.
trust the voice within.
then you will find the strength.
that will guide your way.
if you will learn to begin to.
trust the voice within.

ohh yeah, ooh, yeah ohh.

life is a journey.
it can take you anywhere you choose to go.
as long as you are learning.
you will find all you will ever need to know.
be strong.
break it.
hold on.
you will make it.
be strong.
just do not forsake it because.
no one can tell you what you can not do.
no one can stop you.
you know that i am talking to you.

when theres no one else.
look inside yourself.
and like your oldest friend just.
trust the voice within.
then you will find the strength.
that will guide your way.
you will learn to begin to.
trust the voice within, oh yeah.

young girl do not cry.
i will be right here when your world starts to fall, ohh.
