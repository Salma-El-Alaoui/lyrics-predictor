that it would not last.

but it was saturday night, i guess that makes it all right.
and you say   what have i got to lose?

and honey, i say little red corvette.

i guess i should have closed my eyes when you drove me to the place.
where your horses run free.
cause i felt a little ill when i saw all the pictures.
of the jockeys that were there before me.
believe it or not, i started to worry.
i wondered if i had enough class.
but it was saturday night, i guess that makes it all right.
and you say   baby, have you got enough gas?
