starry nights city lights.
coming down over me.
skyscrapers and stargazers.
in my head.

are we we are, are we we are.
the waiting, unknown.
this dirty town was burning down in my dreams.
lost and found city bound in my dreams.

and screaming.
are we we are, are we we are the waiting.
and screaming.
are we we are, are we we are the waiting.

forget me not and second thoughts.
live in isolation.
heads or tails and fairy tales in my mind.
are we we are, are we we are.
the waiting, unknown.

the rage and love, the story of my life.
the jesus of suburbia is a lie.
and screaming.

are we we are, are we we are the waiting, unknown.
are we we are, are we we are the waiting, unknown.
are we we are, are we we are the waiting, unknown.
are we we are, are we we are the waiting, unknown.
are we we are, are we we are the waiting, unknown..
