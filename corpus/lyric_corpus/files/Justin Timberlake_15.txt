beautiful days are long gone.
i can not seem to breathe.
feels like it has not been that long.
since you walked away from me.
now i can try to act real strong.
but you and i both know.
i still think of you that way.
and you should know that...

beautiful lights, the star filled nights.
they do not mean a thing.
cause you are my star.
so it do not seem right.
without you here with me.
now i can try to act real strong.
but you and i both know.
its hard for me to say you were my soul.

chorus.
now i could say that i do not love you no more.
and i could say that i have closed the door... for our love.
and i could tell you i feel its time for us.
to go our separate ways.
but baby i just would not be the same.
cause girl you are love is still on my brain.

now when you are in love it takes time to heal.
when someone has broken your heart it changes how you feel.

but even after all i still think of you that way, yeah.
