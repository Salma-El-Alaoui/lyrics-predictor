why does it feel like night today?
something in here is not right today.
why am i so uptight today?
paranoia is all i got left.
i do not know what stressed me first or.
how the pressure was fed.
but i know just what it feels like to.
have a voice in the back of my head.
its like a face that i hold inside.
a face that awakes when i close my eyes.
a face that watches every time i lie.
a face that laughs every time i fall.
and watches everything.
so i know that when its time to sink or swim.
that the face inside is hearing me.
right underneath my skin.

its like i am paranoid, looking over my back.
its like a whirlwind inside of my head.
its like i can not stop what i am hearing within.
its like the face inside is right beneath my skin.

i know i have got a face in me.
points out all my mistakes to me.
you have got a face on the inside, too and.
and your paranoias probably worse.
i do not know what set me off first.
but i know what i can not stand.
everybody acts like the fact of the matter is.
i can not add up to what you can.
but everybody has a face that they hold inside.
a face that awakes when i close my eyes.
a face that watches every time they lie.
a face that laughs every time they fall.
and watches everything.
so you know that when its time to sink or swim.
that the face inside is watching you, too.
right inside your skin.

the face inside is right beneath your skin.
the face inside is right beneath your skin.
the face inside is right beneath your skin.

the sun goes down.
i feel the light betray me.
