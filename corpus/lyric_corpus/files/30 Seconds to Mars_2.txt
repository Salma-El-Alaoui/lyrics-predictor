lie awake in bed at night.
and think about your life.
do you want to be different?
try to let go of the truth.
the battles of your youth.
cause this is just a game.

its a beautiful lie.
its a perfect denial.
such a beautiful lie to believe in.
so beautiful, beautiful it makes me.

its time to forget about the past.
to wash away what happened last.
hide behind an empty face.
do not ask too much, just say.
cause this is just a game.

its a beautiful lie.
its a perfect denial.
such a beautiful lie to believe in.
so beautiful, beautiful it makes me.

lie....beautiful.

everyones looking at me.
i am running around in circles baby.
a quiet desperations building higher.
i have got to remember this is just a game.

so beautiful, beautiful...

its a beautiful lie.
beautiful, beautiful.
its a beautiful lie.
beautiful, beautiful.
its a beautiful lie.
beautiful, beautiful.

its a beautiful lie.
its a perfect denial.
such a beautiful lie to believe in.
so beautiful, beautiful it makes me.

shoots himself.
