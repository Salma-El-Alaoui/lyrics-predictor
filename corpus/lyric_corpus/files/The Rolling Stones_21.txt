what a drag it is getting old.

kids are different today.
i hear evry mother say.
mother needs something today to calm her down.
and though shes not really ill.
theres a little yellow pill.
she goes running for the shelter of a mothers little helper.
and it helps her on her way, gets her through her busy day.

things are different today.
i hear evry mother say.
cooking fresh food for a husbands just a drag.
so she buys an instant cake and she burns her frozen steak.
and goes running for the shelter of a mothers little helper.
and two help her on her way, get her through her busy day.

doctor please, some more of these.
outside the door, she took four more.
what a drag it is getting old.

men just are not the same today.
i hear evry mother say.
they just do not appreciate that you get tired.
they are so hard to satisfy, you can tranquilize your mind.
so go running for the shelter of a mothers little helper.
and four help you through the night, help to minimize your plight.

doctor please, some more of these.
outside the door, she took four more.
what a drag it is getting old.

lifes just much too hard today.
i hear evry mother say.
the pursuit of happiness just seems a bore.
and if you take more of those, you will get an overdose.
no more running for the shelter of a mothers little helper.
they just helped you on your way, through your busy dying day.
