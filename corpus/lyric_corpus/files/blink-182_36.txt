breathing deeply.
walking backwards.
finding strength to call and ask her.
roller coaster, favorite ride.
let me kiss you one last time.

leave me standing here.
act like i am not around.
the coast will probably never clear.
can i please go home now?

i had that dream about you again.
where i wait outside.
until you let me in.
and there i stayed.

lay beside me.
and listen at the wall.
we will keep on lying.
until the summer comes.

i had that dream about you again.
where you drive my car.
right off a fucking cliff.

and now i am breathing deeply.
walking backwards.
finding strength to call and ask her.
roller coaster, favorite ride.
let me kiss you one last time.

make me promise.
that i will never tell.
all i remember is.
the way her bedroom smelled.

i had that dream about you again.
where i wait outside.
until you let me in.

and now i am breathing deeply.
walking backwards.
finding strength to call and ask her.
roller coaster, favorite ride.
let me kiss you one last time.
goodnight, goodnight.
