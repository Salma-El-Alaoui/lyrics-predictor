tell me a story.
where we all change.
and wed live our lives together.
and not enstranged.

i did not lose my mind it was.
mine to give away.
could not stay to watch me cry.
you did not have the time.
so i softly slip away...

no regrets they do not work.
no regrets they only hurt.
sing me a love song.
drop me a line.
suppose its just a point of view.
but they tell me i am doing fine.

i know from the outside.
some people said.
we looked good for eachother.
felt things were going wrong.
when you did not like my mother.

i do not want to hate.
but thats all you have left me with.
a bitter aftertaste and a fantasy.
of how we all could live.

no regrets they do not work.
no regrets now, they only hurt.
we have been told you stay up late.
i know they are still talking.
you are far too short to carry weight.
the demons in your head.
return the videos they are late.
if i could just stop hating you.
goodbye.
id feel sorry for us instead.

remember the photographs insane.
the ones where we all laugh so lame.
we were having the time of our lives.
well thank you, it was a real blast.

no regrets, they do not work.
no regrets, they only hurt.
we have been told you stay up late.
write me a love song.
you are far too short to carry weight.
drop me a line.
return the videos they are late.
suppose its just a point of view.
goodbye.
but they tell me i am doing fine.

everything i wanted to be.
everytime i walked away.
everytime you told me to leave.
i just wanted to stay.
everytime you looked at me.
and everytime you smiled.
i felt so vacant you treat me like a child.
i loved the way we used to laugh.
i loved the way we used to smile.
often i sit down and think of you for a while.
and then it passes me by.
and i think of someone else instead.
i guess the love we once had.
is officially.
dead!
