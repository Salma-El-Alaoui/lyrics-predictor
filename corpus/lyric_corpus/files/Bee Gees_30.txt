nobody gets too much heaven no more.
its much harder to come by.
i am waiting in line.
nobody gets too much love anymore.
its as high as a mountain.
and harder to climb.

oh you and me girl.
got a lot of love in store.
and it flows through you, and it flows through me.
and i love you so much more.
and my love.
i can see beyond forever.
everything we own will never die.
love is such a beautiful thing.
oh you make my world a summer day.
are you just a dream to fade away.

nobody gets too much heaven no more.
its much harder to come by.
i am waiting in line.
nobody gets too much love anymore.
its as high as a mountain.
and harder to climb.

you and me girl.
got a highway to the sky.
we can turn away from the night to day.
and the tears we had to cry.

you are my life.
i can see a new tomorrow.
everything we own never die.
love is such a beautiful thing.
when you are to me the light above.
made for all to see.
our precious love.

nobody gets too much heaven no more.
its much harder to come by.
i am waiting in line.
nobody gets too much love anymore.
its as high as a mountain.
and harder to climb.

love is such a beautiful thing.
you make my world a summer day.
are you just a dream to fade away.

nobody gets too much heaven no more.
its much harder to come by.
i am waiting in line.
nobody gets too much love anymore.
its as high as a mountain.
and harder to climb.

nobody gets too much love anymore.
its as wide as a river and harder to cross.
