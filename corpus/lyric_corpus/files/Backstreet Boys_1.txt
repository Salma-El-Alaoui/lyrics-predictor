as long as you love me .

although loneliness has always been a friend of mine.
i am leaving my life in your hands.
people say i am crazy and that i am blind.
risking it all in a glance.
and how you got me blind is still a mystery.
i can not get you out of my head.
do not care what is written in your history.
as long as you are here with me.

i do not care who you are.
where you are from.
what you did.
as long as you love me.
who you are.
where you are from.
do not care what you did.
as long as you love me.

every little thing that you have said and done.
feels like its deep within me.
does not really matter if you are on the run.
it seems like we are meant to be.

i do not care who you arewho you are.
where you are fromwhere you are from.
what you did.
as long as you love mei do not know.
who you arewho you are.
where you are fromwhere you are from.
do not care what you did.
as long as you love me.

as long as you love me.

i have tried to hide it so that no one knows.
but i guess it shows.
when you look into my eyes.
what you did and where you are coming from.
i do not care, as long as you love me, baby.

i do not care who you are who you are.
where you are from where you are from.
what you did.
as long as you love me you love me.
repeat to fade.
who you are who you are.
where you are from where you are from.
do not care what you did.
as long as you love me you love me.

who you arewho you are.
where you are from.
what did you did.
as long as you love me.

who you are.
where you are fromwhere you are from.
as long as you love me.

who you are as long as you love me.
what you did i do not care.
as long as you love me.
