making somebody happy is a question of give and take.
you can learn how to show it so come on, give yourself a break.
every smile and every little touch.
do not you know that they mean so much.
sweet sweet kisses so tender.
always will return to sender.

like a bang, a boom a boomerang.
dum be dum dum be dum be dum dum.
oh bang, a boom a boomerang.
love is a tune you hum de hum hum.
so give it away, i think you will learn.
you will get love in return.
so bang, a boom a boomerang is love.
a boom a boomerang is love.

love is always around and you can look for it anywhere.
when you feel that you have found it my advice is to take good care.
never use it as a selfish tool.
never ever be such a fool.
every feeling you are showing.
is a boomerang you are throwing.

yes a bang, a boom a boomerang.
dum be dum dum be dum be dum dum.
oh bang, a boom a boomerang.
love is a tune you hum de hum hum.
so give it away, i think you will learn.
you will get love in return.
so bang, a boom a boomerang is love.

and if you are warm and tender.
i will kiss you, return to sender.
please surrender.

bang, a boom a boomerang.
dum be dum dum be dum be dum dum.
oh bang, a boom a boomerang is love.
a boom a boomerang is love.
