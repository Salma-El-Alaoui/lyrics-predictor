did you get that rush, that feeling, adrenalin.

pumping through your veins?

a lifeless body in the gutter, city streets are stained.

how do you rationalize, what do you see.

in your reflection?

a kid just having fun, a soldiers bloodied.

boot impression.

one for all and all for one, especially when.

its ten on one.

you do not care what you are doing, you know.

it sure is fun.



if it happened to your mother would.

you laugh so hard?

well, that was someones son or brother.

that you kicked so hard.



this time you went too far.

whats the matter, do not you feel alright?

do you feel remorse?

or are the handcuffs on a little too tight?



now that your friends are gone, you have got no.

defense, no protection.

5 or 6 times a day you receive your hot beef injection.

i hope every time you are cornholed.

terror fills your mind.

the one emotion you have inspired one too many.

times..
