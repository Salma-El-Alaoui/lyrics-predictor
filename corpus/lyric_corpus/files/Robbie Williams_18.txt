out of a million seeds.
only the strongest one breathes.
you made a miracle mother.
i will make a man out of me.

daddy wheres the sun gone from the sky?
what did we do wrong, why did it die?
and all the grown ups say sorry kids we got no reply.

if you are willing to change the world.
let love be your energy.
i have got more than i need.
when your love shines down on me.

every tear that you cry.
will be replaced when you die.
why do not you love your brother?
are you out of your mind?

daddy wheres the sun gone from the sky?
what did we do wrong, why did it die?
and if you have got no love for me then i will say goodbye.

if you are willing to change the world.
let love be your energy.
i have got more than i need.
when your love shines down on me.

if you are willing to change the world.
let love be your energy.
i can not contain how i feel.
when your love shines down on me.

well if you want it come and make a stance.
so when its in your hands.
people show me love.
