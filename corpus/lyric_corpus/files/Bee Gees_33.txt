smile an everlasting smile.
a smile can bring you near to me.
do not ever let me find you gone.
cause that could bring a tear to me.

this world has lost its glory.
let us start a brand new story, now my love.
right now there will be no other time.
and i can show you all, my love.

talk in everlasting words.
and dedicate them all to me.
and i will give you all my life.
i am here if you should call to me.

you think that i do not even mean.
a single word i say.
its only words and words are all i have.
to take your heart away.
