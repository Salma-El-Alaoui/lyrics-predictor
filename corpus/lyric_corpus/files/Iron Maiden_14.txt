from here to eternity.

she fell in love with his greasy machine.
she leaned over wiped his head.
kickstart clean.
shed never seen the beast before.
but she left there wanting.
more more more.
but when she was walking on.
down the road.
she heard a sound that made.
her heart explode.
he whispered to her to get on the back.
i will take you on a ride.
from here to eternity.

hell aingt a bad place.
hell is from here to eternity.
hell aingt a bad place.
hell is from here to eternity.

she must be having one of her.
crazy dreams.
shed never sat on a piece so mean.
it made her feel like shes on cloud nine.
she even thought she heard the.
engine sigh.

but like all dreams that come to an end.
they took a tumble at the devils bend.
the beast and charlotte they were.
two of a kind.
theyd always take the line...
from here to eternity.

hell aingt a bad place.
hell is from here to eternity.
hell aingt a bad place.
hell is from here to eternity.
