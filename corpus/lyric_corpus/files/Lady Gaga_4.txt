when your brown eyes, walked away.
and your brown eyes, could not stay.
in your brown eyes, you watch her go.
then turn the record on.
and wonder what went wrong what went wrong.

if everything was everything, but everything is over.
everything could be everything, if only we were older.
guess its just a silly song about you.
and how i lost you.
and your brown eyes.

in your brown eyes, i was feeling low.
cause the brown eyes, and you will never know.
got some brown eyes, but i saw her face.
i knew that it was wrong, so baby.
turn the record on, play that song.

where everything was everything, but everything is over.
everything could be everything, if only we were older.
guess its just a silly song about you.
and how i lost you.
and your brown eyes.

everything was everything, but baby its the last show.
everything could be everything, but its time to say goodbye.
so, get your last fix and your last hit.
grab your old, go with the new trix.

its no surprise that i got lost in your brown eyes.
in your brown eyes.. brown eyes repeat.
