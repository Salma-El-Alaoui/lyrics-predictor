shes a rebel.
shes a saint.
shes the salt of the earth.
and shes dangerous.

shes a rebel.
vigilante.
missing link on the brink.
of destruction.

from chicago to toronto.
shes the one that they.
call old whatsername.

shes the symbol.
of resistance.
and shes holding on my.
heart like a hand grenade.

is she dreaming.
what i am thinking?
is she the mother of all bombs.
gonna detonate?

is she trouble.
like i am trouble?
make it a double.
twist of fate.
or a melody that.

she sings the revolution.
the dawning of our lives.
she brings this liberation.
that i just can not define.
nothing comes to mind.
x2.

shes a rebel.
shes a saint.
shes the salt of the earth.
and shes dangerous.

shes a rebel.
vigilante.
missing link on the brink.
of destruction.
x2.

shes a rebel, shes a rebel, shes a rebel, and shes dangerous.
shes a rebel, shes a rebel, shes a rebel, and shes dangerous.
