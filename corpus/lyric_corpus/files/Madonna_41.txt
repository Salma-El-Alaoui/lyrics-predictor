listen.

i have had other guys.
i have looked into their eyes.
but i never knew love before.
til you walked through my door.
i have had other lips.
i have sailed a thousand ships.
but no matter where i go.

chorus.

true love.
you are the one i am dreaming of.
your heart fits me like a glove.
and i am gonna be true blue baby i love you.

i have heard all the lines.
i have cried oh so many times.
those tear drops they will not fall again.
i am so excited cause you are my best friend.
so if you should ever doubt.
wonder what love is all about.
just think back and remember dear.
those words whispered in your ear, i said.

chorus twice.

the sun is bursting right out of the sky.
i searched the whole world for someone like you.

true love, oh baby, true love, oh baby.
true love, oh baby, true love its.
