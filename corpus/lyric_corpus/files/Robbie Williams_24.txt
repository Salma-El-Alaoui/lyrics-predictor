i have sung some songs that were lame.
i have slept with girls on the game.
i have got my catholic shame.
lord i am in purgatory.
basically, its all come on top for me.

i was not me when we met.
you have not lost my respect.
i am here to serve and protect.
what shade of insanity.
keeps leading you back to me.

so put your hands across the water.
mushroom.
monsoon.

do not wanna piss on your parade.
i am here to make money and get laid.
yeah i am a star but i will fade.
if you aingt sticking your knives in me.
you will be eventually.

to all you sharons and michelles.
with all your tales to sell.
save your meat money well.
i am glad that spending a night with me.
guaranteed you celebrity.

and i can not talk in a crowd.
when i am alone i am too loud.
you have done your daddies proud.
thank you for keeping me company.
you have all been so nice to me.

so put your hands across the water.
mushroom.
monsoon.
come soon.

oh lor, i feel nothing.
i know much smarter men never got this far.

i have got so many regrets.
i smoked too many cigarettes.
i have had more blondes than brunettes.
i am not expecting your sympathy.
but its all been too much for me.

so put your hands across the water.
mushroom.
monsoon.
come soon.
so put your hands across the water.
mushroom.
monsoon.
come soon.
