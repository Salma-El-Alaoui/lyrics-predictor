from the moment the lights went off.
everything had changed.
lie awake in an empty room.
in my head it all feels the same.

like the taste of the day you left.
it still lingers on my breath.
and the dampness of tears that left.
that stain where you had wept.

all alone with the negligee.
that still hangs off of my bed.
i keep meaning to give it away.
but i just leave it there instead.

no need to cry about it.
i cannot live without it.
every time i wind up back at your door.

why do you do this to me?
you penetrate right through me.
every time i wind up back at your door.

3 more days til i see your face.
i am afraid its far too much.
cook a meal and fix up the place.
dial your number, hang it up.

if i took you for granted.
i apologize for acting tough.
you are my reason for living.
and theres no way i am giving up, oh.

no need to cry about it.
i cannot live without it.
every time i wind up back at your door.

why do you do this to me?
you penetrate right through me.
every time i wind up back at your door.

now every evening is a bitter fight.
and i am eating all alone on a friday night.
and i know what your friends say.
hes just wasting your love and time.
i will never let you change your mind.

no need to cry about it.
i cannot live without it.
every time i wind up back at your door.

why do you do this to me?
you penetrate right through me.
every time i wind up back at your door.

no need to cry about it.
i may just die without it.
every time i wind up back at your door.

why do you do this to me?
you penetrate right through me.
every time i wind up back at your door.

every time i wind up back at your door.
every time i wind up back at your door.
