hey fellas, have you heard the news?
you know that annies back in town?
it will not take long, just watch and see.
all the fellas lay their money down.

her style is new, but the face the same.
as it was so long ago.
but from her eyes, a different smile.
like that of one who knows.

well, its been ten years and maybe more.
since i first set eyes on you.
the best years of my life gone by.
here i am alone and blue.

some people cry and some people die.
by the wicked ways of love.
but i will just keep on rolling along.
with the grace of the lord above.

people talking all around.
bout the way you left me flat.
i do not care what the people say.
i know where their jive is at.

one thing i do have on my mind.
if you can clarify, please do.
its the way you call me another guys name.
when i try to make love to you.
i try to make love, but it aingt no use.
give it to me, give it.

work so hard, i can not unwind.
get some money saved.
abuse my love a thousand times.
however hard i tried.

heartbreaker, your time has come.
ca not take your evil ways.
go away, heartbreaker.
heartbreaker, heartbreaker, heart!
