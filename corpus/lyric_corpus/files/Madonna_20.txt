i wanna kiss you in paris.
i wanna hold your hand in rome.
i wanna run naked in a rainstorm.
make love in a train cross country.
you put this in me.
so now what, so now what?

chorus.

wanting, needing, waiting.
for you to justify my love.

hoping, praying.
for you to justify my love.

i want to know you.
not like that.
i do not wanna be your mother.
i do not wanna be your sister either.
i just wanna be your lover.
i wanna be your baby.
kiss me, thats right, kiss me.

chorus.

yearning, burning.
for you to justify my love.

what are you gonna do?
what are you gonna do?
talk to me    tell me your dreams.
am i in them?
tell me your fears.
are you scared?
tell me your stories.
i am not afraid of who you are.
we can fly!

poor is the man.
whose pleasures depend.
on the permission of another.
love me, thats right, love me.
i wanna be your baby.

chorus.

i am open and ready.
for you to justify my love.
to justify my love.
wanting, to justify.
waiting, to justify my love.
praying, to justify.
to justify my love.
i am open, to justify my love.
