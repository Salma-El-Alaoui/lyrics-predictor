the lunatic is on the grass.
the lunatic is on the grass.
remembering games and daisy chains and laughs.
got to keep the loonies on the path.

the lunatic is in the hall.
the lunatics are in my hall.
the paper holds their folded faces to the floor.
and every day the paper boy brings more.

and if the dam breaks open many years too soon.
and if there is no room upon the hill.
and if your head explodes with dark forebodings too.
i will see you on the dark side of the moon.

the lunatic is in my head.
the lunatic is in my head.
you raise the blade, you make the change.
you re arrange me til i am sane.
you lock the door.
and throw away the key.
theres someone in my head but its not me.

and if the cloud bursts, thunder in your ear.
you shout but no one seems to hear.
and if the band you are in starts playing different tunes.
i will see you on the dark side of the moon.

i cannot think of anything to say except, ha, ha, ha, i think its marvelous!
ha, ha, ha!
