somewhere, beyond the sea.
somewhere waiting for me...
my lover stands on golden sands.
and watches the ships that go sailing.

somewhere, beyond the sea.
shes there watching for me.
if i could fly like birds on high.
then straight to her arms.
i will go sailing.

its far, beyond the stars.
its near, beyond the moon.
i know... beyond a doubt.
my heart will lead me there soon...

we will meet, beyond the shore.
we will kiss just like before.
happy we will be beyond the sea.
and never again, i will go sailing.


i know, beyond a doubt...
my heart... will lead me there soon.

we will meet, i know we will meet, beyond the shore.
we will kiss just as before.
happy we will be beyond the sea...
and never again, i will go sailing.

no more sailing.
so long, sailing, sailing.
no more sailing.

goodbye, farewell, my friend.
no more sailing.
so long, sailing.
no more sailing.

no more, farewell.
auf wiedersehen to ya and ya and ya.

no more sailing.
no more oh, no more sailing.

no more, no more.
no more sailing...

no more.
one more time.

no more sailing...

yeah.
