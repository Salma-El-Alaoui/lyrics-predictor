she lays in bed at night and that is when i make my call.
but when she stares at me, she can not see nothing at all.
because, you see, i can not take no shape or form.
its been three long years since i have been gone.

i can not get used to purgatory, you know it really makes me cry.
i will never know the reason why i had to go.
oh, oh, i am crying.
oh, oh, oh, deep inside of me.
oh, oh, oh, can not you see me?
ah can not you see me?

i am looking forward to her spirit coming over to me.
i feel tempted to bring her over to see just what its.
like to be hanging on the other side.
i feel so lonely, its a long time since i died.

i try to show her that shes never gonna be alone.
because my spirit is imprisoned in the twilight zone.
oh, oh, i am crying.
oh, oh, oh, deep inside of me.
oh, oh, oh, can not you see me?
ah can not you see me?
