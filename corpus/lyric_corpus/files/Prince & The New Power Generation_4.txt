this will be the day.
that you will hear me say.
that i will never run away.
i am here for you.
love is meant for two.
now tell me what you are gonna do.

chorus.
if i gave you diamonds and pearls.
would you be a happy boy or a girl.
if i could i would give you the world.
but all i can do is just offer you.
my love.

which one of us is right.
if we always fight.
why can not we just let love decide.
let love decide.
am i the weaker man.
because i understand.
that love must be the master plan.

chorus.

bridge.
d to the i to the a to the m.
o to the n to the d to the pearls of love.
d to the i to the a to the m.
o to the n to the d to the pearls of love.

there will come a time.
thery will come a time.
when you will blow your mind.
your mind.
and everything you look for you will find.
take a look inside.
there will be the time.
thery will be the time.
when everything will shine.
oh yeah.
so bright it makes you color blind.
you will be color blind.

chorus x 2 to fade.
