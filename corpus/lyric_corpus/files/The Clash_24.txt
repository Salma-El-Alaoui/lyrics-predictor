i am all lost in the supermarket.
i can no longer shop happily.
i came in here for that special offer.
a guaranteed personality.

i was not born so much as i fell out.
nobody seemed to notice me.
we had a hedge back home in the suburbs.
over which i never could see.

i heard the people who lived on the ceiling.
scream and fight most scarily.
hearing that noise was my first ever feeling.
thats how its been all around me.

i am all lost in the supermarket.
i can no longer shop happily.
i came in here for that special offer.
a guaranteed personality.

i am all tuned in, i see all the programmes.
i save coupons from packets of tea.
i have got my giant hit discoteque album.
i empty a bottle and i feel a bit free.

the kids in the halls and the pipes in the walls.
make me noises for company.
long distance callers make long distance calls.
and the silence makes me lonely.

i am all lost in the supermarket.
i can no longer shop happily.

and its not hear.
