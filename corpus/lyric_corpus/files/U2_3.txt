it was a cold and wet december day.
when we touched the ground at jfk.
snow was melting on the ground.
on bls i heard the sound.
of an angel.

new york, like a christmas tree.
tonight this city belongs to me.
angel.

soul love...this love will not let me go.
so long...angel of harlem.

birdland on fifty three.
the street sounds like a symphony.
we got john coltrane and a love supreme.
miles, and shes got to be an angel.

lady day got diamond eyes.
she sees the truth behind the lies.
angel.

soul love...this love will not let me go.
so long...angel of harlem.
angel of harlem.

she says its heart...heart and soul...
yeah yeah...yeah.
yeah yeah...right now.

blue light on the avenue.
god knows they got to you.
an empty glass, the lady sings.
eyes swollen like a bee sting.
blinded you lost your way.
through the side streets and the alleyway.
like a star exploding in the night.
falling to the city in broad daylight.
an angel in devils shoes.
salvation in the blues.
you never looked like an angel.
yeah yeah...angel of harlem.

angel...angel of harlem....
