you may push me around.
but you cannot win.
you may throw me down.
but i will rise again.
the more you say.
the more i defy you.
so get out of my face.

chorus.
you cannot stop us.
you cannot bring us down.
never give up.
we go on and on.
you will never break us.
never bring us down.
we are alive!

the wind blows.
i will lean into the wind.
my angle grows.
i will use it to win.
the more you say.
the more i defy you.
so get out of my way.

all my will.
all my strength.
rip it out.
start again.

chorus.

x3.
all my will.
all my strength.
rip it out.
start again.

can you leave it all behind?
cause you can not go back.
you can not go back.

chorus.
we are alive!
