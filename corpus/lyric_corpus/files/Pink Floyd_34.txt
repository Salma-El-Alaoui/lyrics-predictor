the worm.
good morning, the worm, your honour.
the crown will plainly show.
the prisoner who now stands before you.
was caught red handed showing feelings  .
showing feelings of an almost human nature!
this will not do.

call the schoolmaster!

the schoolmaster.
i always said hed come to no good.
in the end your honour.
if theyd let me have my way i could.
have flayed him into shape.
but my hands were tied.
the bleeding hearts and artists.
let him get away with murder.
let me hammer him today.

pink.
crazy.
toys in the attic, i am crazy.
truly gone fishing.

they must have taken my marbles away.

chorus.
crazy.
toys in the attic, he is crazy.

the wife.
you little shit, you are in it now.
i hope they throw away the key.
you should have talked to me more often than you did.
but no! you had to go your own way.
have you broken any homes up lately?
just five minutes, worm, your honour, him and me alone.

the mother.
baaaaaaaaaaabe.
come to mother baby let me hold you in my arms.
mlud i never wanted him to get in any trouble.
whyd he ever have to leave me.
worm, your honour, let me take him home.

pink.
crazy.
over the rainbow, i am crazy.
bars in the window.

there must have been a door there in the wall.
when i came in...

chorus.
crazy.
over the rainbow, he is crazy.

the judge.
the evidence before the court is incontravertible.
theres no need for the jury to retire.
in all my years of judging i have never heard before.
of someone more deserving of the full penalty of law.
the way you made them suffer.
your exquisite wife and mother.
fills me with the urge to defecate.

spoken go on judge, shit on him!

since, my friend, you have revealed your deepest fear.
i sentence you to be exposed before your peers.

tear down the wall!

chorus.
tear down the wall! repeat.
