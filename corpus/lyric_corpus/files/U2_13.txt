you do not know how you took it.
you just know what you got.
oh lawdy, you been stealing from the thieves.
and you got caught.
in the headlights of a stretch car.
you are a star.

dressing like your sister.
living like a tart.
if they do not know what you are doing.
babe it must be art.
you are a headache, in a suitcase.
you are a star.

oh, no, do not be shy.
you do not have to go blind.
hold me, thrill me, kiss me, kill me.

you do not know how you got here.
you just know you want out.
believing in yourself almost as much as you doubt.
you are a big smash.
you wear it like a rash.
star.

oh no, do not be shy.
it takes a crowd to cry.
hold me, thrill me, kiss me, kill me.

they want you to be jesus.
they will go down on one knee.
but they will want their money back.
if you are alive at thirty three.
and you are turning tricks.
with your crucifix.
you are a star.
oh child.

of course you are not shy.
you do not have to deny love.
hold me, thrill me, kiss me, kill me..
