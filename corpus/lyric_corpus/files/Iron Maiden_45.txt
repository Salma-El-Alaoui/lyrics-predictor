its snowing outside, the rumbling sound.
of engines roar in the night.
the mission is near the confident men.
are waiting to drop from the sky.

the blizzard goes on, but still they must fly.
no one should go where eagles dare.

bavarian alps that lay all around.
they seem to stare from below.
the enemy lines a long time passed.
are lying deep in the snow.

into the night they fall through the sky.
no one should fly where eagles dare.

their closing in, the fortress is near.
its standing high in the sky.
the cable cars the only way in.
its really impossible to climb.

they make their way, but maybe too late.
they have got to try to save the day.

the panicking cries, the roaring of guns.
are echoing all around the valley.
the mission complete, they make to scape.
away from the eagles nest.

they dared to go where no one would try.
they chose to fly where eagles dare.
