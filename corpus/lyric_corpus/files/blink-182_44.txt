i am wasting time thinking about a girl.
and stealing her away from her world.
she and i would run away.
i think of all the things that id say.

wed talk about important things.
and i picture it in my dreams.
shed teach me about modern art.
and id show her its okay to fart and.

maybe id impress her.
by being in a band and.
maybe if i act real tough.
shed let me hold her hand and.
maybe i will win her heart.
by writing this song about her.

sometimes i sit at home and.
wonder if shes sitting at home.
thinking of me and wondering if i am.
sitting at home, thinking about her.
or am i just wasting my time.

remembering how she laughed at kinkos.
when i made fun of that guy.
remebering the look she gave me.
when i told her that i used to fry.

i really want to ask her out.
but my ego could never take it.
and even if i got the balls.
you know that the cougar would never make it.

and in my town you can not drive naked.

and maybe id impress her.
by being in a band and.
maybe if i act real tough.
shed let me hold her hand and.
maybe i will win her heart.
by writing this song about her.

sometimes i sit at home and.
wonder if shes sitting at home.
thinking of me and wondering if i am.
sitting at home, thinking about her.
or am i just wasting my time.

am i just wasting my time.
am i just wasting my time.
am i just wasting my time.
wasting my time thinking about a girl.
