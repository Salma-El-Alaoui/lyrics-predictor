got to say it and its hard for me.
you got me crying like i thought i would never be.
love is believing but you let me down.
how can i love you when you aingt around.
and i .....

get to the morning and you never call.
love should be evrything or not at all.
and it do not matter what ever you do.
i made a life out of loving you.

only to find any dream that i follow is dying.
i am crying in the rain.
i could be searching my world for a love everlasting.
feeling no pain, when will we meet again.

why do you have to be a heartbreaker.
is it a lesson that i never knew.
gotta get out of the spell that i am under.
my love for you.
why do you have to be a heartbreaker.
when i was being what you want me to be.
suddenly evrything i ever wanted has passed me by.
this world may end.
not you and i.

my love is stronger than the universe.
my soul is crying for you.
and that can not be reversed.
you made the rules but you could not see.
you made a life out of hurting me.

out of my mind .
i am held by the power of you love.
tell me when do we try.
why should we say goodbye.

ohhh.
why do you have to be a heartbreaker.
when i was being what you want me to be.
suddenly evrthing i ever wanted has passed me by.

ohhh.
why do you have to be a heartbreaker.
is it a lesson that i never knew.
suddenly evrthing i ever wanted my love for you.

why do you have to be a heartbreaker.
when i was being what you want me to be.
suddenly evrthing i ever wanted has passed me by.
