is not it rich.
are not we a pair.
me here at last on the ground.
you in mid air.
send in the clowns.
is not it bliss.
do not you approve.
one who keeps tearing around.
one who can not move.
where are the clowns?
send in the clowns.

just when i stopped opening doors.
finally knowing the one that i wanted was yours.
making my entrance again with my usual flair.
sure of my lines   no one is there.

do not you love farce.
my fault i fear.


i thought that youd want what i want.
sorry my dear.
but where are the clowns.
there ought to be clowns.
quick send in the clowns.

what a surprise.
who could foresee?
i have come to feel about you what you felt about me.
why only now when i see that you have drifted away.
what a surprise, what a clich.

is not it rich, is not it queer.
losing my timing this late in my career.
and where are the clowns.
quick send in the clowns.
do not bother they are here..
