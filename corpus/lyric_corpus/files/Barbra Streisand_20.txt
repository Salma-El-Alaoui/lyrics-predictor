oh my man i love him so.
he will never know.
all my life is just despair.
but i do not care.
when he takes me in his arms.
the world is bright, alright.
whats the difference if i say.
i will go away.
when i know i will come back.
on my knees someday.
oh whatever my man is.
i am his.
forever more.
it cost me a lot.
but thats one thing that i have got.
its my man.
cold and wet.
tired you bet.
but all that i soon forget.
with my man.
hes not much for looks.


and no hero out of books.
hes my man.
two or three girls has he.
that he likes as well as me.
but i love him.

oh my man i love him so.
