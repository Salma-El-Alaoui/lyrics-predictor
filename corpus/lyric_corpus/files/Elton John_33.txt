its a little bit funny, this feeling inside.
i am not one of those who can easily hide.
i do not have much money, but, boy if i did.
id buy a big house where we both could live.
if i was a sculptor, heh... but then again no.
or a man who makes potions in a traveling show.
i know its not much but its the best i can do.
my gift is my song and... this ones for you.

and you can tell everybody this is your song.
it may be quite simple, but now that its done.
i hope you do not mind, i hope you do not mind.
that i put down in words...
how wonderful life is... while you are in the world.

i sat on the roof and kicked off the moss.
well, a few are the verses, well they.
they have got me quite cross.
but the suns been quite kind while i wrote this song.
its for people like you that keep it turned on.

so excuse me forgetting, but these things i do.
you see i have forgotten if they are green or they are blue.
anyway, the thing is... what i really mean...
yours are the sweetest eyes i have ever seen.

and you can tell everybody that this is your song.
it may be quite simple but now that its done.
i hope you do not mind, i hope you do not mind.
that i put down in words.
how wonderful life is... while you are in the world.
i hope you do not mind, i hope you do not mind.
that i put down in words.
how wonderful life is... while you are in the world.
