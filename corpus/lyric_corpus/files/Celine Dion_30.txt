hey man, come over here.
theres a secret that i wanna whisper in your ear.
i have waited so long, too long.
but i can not deny it anymore its just too strong.

its a special kind of feeling.
something to believe in, oh yeah.

so lay back, and let it flow.
then just open up your heart and let your feelings go.
i said quothey man, yo manquot.
well its really not that difficult to understand.

that its me that you have been seeing.
baby when you are dreaming, at night.

so let your walls come down.
and you will feel my emotion.
i will shelter you.
from a tear or an ocean.

whenever your hope is gone.
i will give you strength to carry on.
in the darkness of the night.
i will be your light.
i will give you something to hold on to.
when you can not find your way.
like a fire burning bright.
i will be your light.

so relax, we will take it slow.
i would not think youd really have a better place to go.
i said quothey man, yo manquot.
why do not you move a little closer here and take my hand.

are you feeling what i am feeling.
i know i must be dreaming, oh yeah.

but sometimes life can come.
to build a wall in between us.
do not let it get you down.
whoever said love was an easy thing.

whenever your hope is gone.
i will give you strength to carry on.
in the darkness of the night.
i will be your light.
i will give you something to hold on to.
when you can not find your way.
like a fire burning bright.
i will be your light.

i will be your light.
whenever you need a friend.
just come over to me baby.
baby baby baby.
so let your walls come down.
and you will feel my emotion.
i will shelter you.
from a tear or an ocean.

whenever your hope is gone.
i will give your strength to carry on.
in the darkness of the night.
i will be your light.
i will give you something to hold on to.
when you can not find your way.
like a fire burning bright.
i will be your light.

whenever your hope is gone.
i will give your strength to carry on.
in the darkness of the night.
i will be your light.
light, shining bright, baby.
i will be the one who holds you, baby.
i will be the one who loves you, baby.
be the one who holds you, loves you.
baby, baby.
