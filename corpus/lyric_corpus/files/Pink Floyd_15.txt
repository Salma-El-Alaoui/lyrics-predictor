spoken look mummy, theres an aeroplane up in the sky.

did you see the frightened ones?
did you hear the falling bombs?
did you ever wonder why we had to run for shelter.
when the promise of a brave new world.
unfurled beneath a clear blue sky?

did you see the frightened ones?
did you hear the falling bombs?
the flames are all long gone, but the pain lingers on.

goodbye, blue sky.
goodbye, blue sky.
goodbye.
goodbye.

spoken the 1115 from newcastle is now approaching.
the 1118 arrival.....
