wake alone in the hills.
with the wind in your face.
it feels good to be proud.
and be free and a race.
that is part of a clan.
and to live on highlands.
and the air that you breathe.
so pure and so clean.

when alone on the hills.
with the wind in your hair.
with a longing to feel ..
just to be free.

is it right to believe.
in the need to be free.
its a time when you die.
and without asking why.
ca not you see what they do.
they are grinding us down.
they are taking our land.
that belongs to the clans.

not alone with a dream.
just want to be free.
with a need to belong.
i am a clansman .....freedom.

its a time wrought with fear.
its a land wrought with change.

ancestors could hear.
what is happening now.
they would turn in their graves.
they would all be ashamed.
that the land of the free.
has been written in chains.
and i know what i want.

when the timing is right.
then i will take what is mine.
i am the clansman.

and i swear to defend.
and we will fight to the end.
and i swear that i will never.
be taken alive.
and i know that we will stand.
and we will fight for our land.
and i swear that my bairns will be born free.

and i know what i want.
when the timing is right.
then i will take what i want.
i am the clansman .....freedom.

no, no we can not let them take anymore.
no we can not let them take anymore.
we have the land of the free.
freedom.

is it right to believe.
in the need to be free.
its a time when you die.
and without asking why.
ca not you see what they do.

not alone with a dream.
just want to be free.
