oh, how i wish that they would last.
moments of peace that just slip through me so fast.
just when i think that they are gonna stay.
everything inside me just starts fading away.

sometimes it seems like all i hope for.
just gets thrown down on the floor.
and then it seems like you do not love me anymore.
sometimes i wish that i could run away.
sometimes i wish i just had something to say.

she looks at me and does not know the words to say.
but its not you, i just do not feel quite right today.
all these things i say and do were never planned.
but how the fuck am i supposed to make you understand that.

sometimes it seems like all i hope for.
just gets thrown down on the floor.
and then it seems like you do not love me anymore.
sometimes i wish that i could run away.
sometimes i wish i just had something to say.
