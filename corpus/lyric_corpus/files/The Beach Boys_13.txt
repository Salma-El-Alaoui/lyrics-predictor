well she got her daddys car.
and she cruised through the hamburger stand now.
seems she forgot all about the library.
like she told her old man now.
and with the radio blasting.
goes cruising just as fast as she can now.

and she will have fun fun fun.
til her daddy takes the t bird away.
fun fun fun til her daddy takes the t bird away.

well the girls can not stand her.
cause she walks looks and drives like an ace now.
you walk like an ace now you walk like an ace.
she makes the indy 500 look like a roman chariot race now.
you look like an ace now you look like an ace.
a lotta guys try to catch her.
but she leads them on a wild goose chase now.
you drive like an ace now you drive like an ace.

and she will have fun fun fun.
til her daddy takes the t bird away.
fun fun fun til her daddy takes the t bird away.

well you knew all along.
that your dad was getting wise to you now.
you should not have lied now you should not have lied.
and since he took your set of keys.
you have been thinking that your fun is all through now.
you should not have lied now you should not have lied.

but you can come along with me.
cause we gotta a lot of things to do now.
you should not have lied now you should not have lied.

and we will have fun fun fun now that daddy took the t bird away.
fun fun fun now that daddy took the t bird away.
and we will have fun fun fun now that daddy took the t bird away.
fun fun fun now that daddy took the t bird away.
fun fun now that daddy took the t bird away.
fun fun now that daddy took the t bird away.
fun fun now that daddy took the t bird away.
fun fun now that daddy took the t bird away.
fun fun now that daddy took the t bird away.
fun fun now that daddy took the t bird away.
