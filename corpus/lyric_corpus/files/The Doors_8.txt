well, i got into town about an hour ago.
took a look around see which way the wind blow.
with a little girl in a hollywood bungalow.
are you a lucky little lady in the city of light.
or just another lost angel.

city at night.
city at night.
city at night.
city at night.

l.a. woman, l.a woman.
l.a. woman, sunday afternoon.
l.a woman, sunday afternoon.

l.a woman, sunday afternoon.
drive thru your suburbs.
into your blues.
into your blues.
into your blue, blue, blues.
into your blues.

i see your hair is burning.
hills are filled with fire.
if they say i never loved you.
you know they are a liar.

driving down your freeway.
midnight alleys roam.
cops in cars, the topless bars.
never saw a woman.
so alone.
so alone, so alone, so alone.

motel money murder madness.
let us change the mood.
from glad to sadness.

mr. mojo rising.
mr. mojo rising.
mr. mojo rising.
mr. mojo rising.
got to keep on rising.
mr. mojo rising.
mr. mojo rising.
mr. mojo rising.
mr. mojo rising.
got my mojo rising.
mr. mojo rising.
got to keep on rising.
going riding, riding.
going riding, riding.
got to riding, riding.
riding, riding.

well, i got into town about an hour ago.

city at night.
city at night.
city at night.

l.a. woman, l.a woman.
l.a woman.
you are my woman.

a little l.a woman.
l.a woman.
hey, hey, come on.
l.a woman come on.
