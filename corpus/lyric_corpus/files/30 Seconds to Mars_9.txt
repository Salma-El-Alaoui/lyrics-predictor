you know enough to know the way.
six billion people just one name.
i found.
i found tomorrow in today.
apocalyptic and insane, my dreams will never change.

you wanna be the one in control.
you wanna be the one whos alive.
you wanna be the one who gets old.
its not a matter of luck, its just a matter of time.

stand out on the edge of the earth.

stand out on the edge of the earth.
dive into the center of fate.
walk right in the sight of the gun.
look into this new futures face.

i know you know enough to say.
i know you know enough to play the game.

you wanna be the one in control.
you wanna be the one whos alive.
you wanna be the one who gets old.
its not a matter of luck, its just a matter of time.

stand out on the edge of the earth.
dive into the center of fate.
walk right in the sight of the gun.
look into this new futures face.

stand out on the edge of the earth.

stand out on the edge of the earth.
stand out on the edge of the earth.
look into the new futures face.
stand out on the edge of the earth.
