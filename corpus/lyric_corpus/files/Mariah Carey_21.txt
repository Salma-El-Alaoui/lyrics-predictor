o holy night the stars are brightly shining.
it is the night of our dear saviors birth.
long lay the world in sin and error pining.
till he appeared and the soul felt its worth.

a thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices.
for yonder breaks a new glorious morn.
fall on your knees.
o hear the angels voices.
o night divine.
o night when christ was born.
o night divine, o night.
o night divine.

a thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices.
for yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.
fall on your knees.
o hear the angels voices.
o night divine.
o night when christ was born.
o night divine, o night.
o night divine.
