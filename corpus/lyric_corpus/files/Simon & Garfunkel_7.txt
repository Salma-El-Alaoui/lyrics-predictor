april come she will.
when streams are ripe and swell with rain.
may she will stay.
resting in my arms again.

june she will change her tune.
in restless walks she will prowl the night.
july she will fly.
and give no warning to her flight.

august die she must.
the autumn winds blow chilly and cold.
september i will remember.
a love once new has now grown old..
