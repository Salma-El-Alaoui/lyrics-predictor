its so hard to find you.
i am standing right behind you.
the streets are much colder.
this mean i am getting older.

why would you? how could i?
these questions lead to goodbye.
but now i got my freedom.
do not i?

i parked my car outside your house.
hope that someday you will come home.
seems the woman that i love.
is someone that i hardly know.
and after all this time.
i finally found a way to be loved.
i am terrified to think that i may be losing my mind.

shy girl, so humble.
with eyes that make me stumble.
somehow not speaking let us me know everything.
i go out, you eat in.
hot from the situation.
your in daylight.
goodnight.

i am burning, i am hungry.
you got me completely.
in my own game you beat me.

i parked my car outside your house.
hope that someday you will come home.
seems the woman that i love.
is someone that i hardly know.
and after all this time.
i finally found a way to be loved.
i am terrified i think that i may be losing my mind.

i will be back again.
no this is not the end.
i have fallen hard this time but i not giving in.
i want the world to know that i will not let you forget.
the tears that you shed.
i will make it impossible to let go.
