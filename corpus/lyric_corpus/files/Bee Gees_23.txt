listen to the ground.
there is movement all around.
there is something going down.
and i can feel it.

on the waves of the air.
there is dancing out there.
if its something we can share.
we can steal it.

and that sweet city woman.
she moves through the light.
controlling my mind and my soul.
when you reach out for me, girl.
and the feeling is right.

chorus.
then i get that.
night fever, night fever.
we know how to do it.
gimme that.
night fever, night fever.
we know how to show it.

here i am.
praying for this moment to last.
living on the music so fine.
born on the wind.
making it mine.

chorus.

in the heat of our love.
do not need no help for us to make it.
gimme just enough to take us to the morning.
i got fire in my mind.
i get higher in my walking.
and i am glowing in the dark.
i give you warning.

and that sweet city woman.
she moves through the light.
controlling my mind and my soul.
when you reach out for me, girl.
and the feeling is right.

chorus.

here i am.
praying for this moment to last.
living on the music so fine.
born on the wind.
making it mine.

chorus.
