were gonna play a cuple of songs we have not played for a little while,we just decided to make this show a little longer than we planed.
yesterday, there was so many things.
i was never told.
now that i am starting to learn.
i feel i am growing old.

cause yesterdays got nothing for me.
old pictures that i will always see.
some things could be better.
in my book of memories.
prayers in my pocket.
and no hand in destiny.
i will keep on moving along.
with no time to plant my feet.

cause yesterdays got nothing for me.
old pictures that i will always see.
some things could be better.
if wed all just let them be.

yesterdays got nothing for me.
yesterdays got nothing for me.
got nothing for me.

yesterday, there was so many things.
i was never shown.
suddenly this time i found.
i am on the streets and i am all alone.

yesterdays got nothing for me.
old pictures that i will always see.
i aingt got time to reminisce old novelties.

yesterdays got nothing for me.
yesterdays got nothing for me.
yesterdays got nothing for me.
yesterday.

yesterday.
