yeah baby hahahaha.
hello austin.
hey basil how are you.
we need your help.
someone is seducing our top agents.
as you can see, she is a master of disguise.
hoo hoo hoo hoo, oh.
but austin, whatever you do.
do not fall in love.
we have already lost 007 and 008.
well then basil this looks like a case.

have not we met.
you are some kind of beautiful stranger.
you could be good for me.
i have had the taste for danger.

if i am smart then i will run away.
but i am not so i guess i will stay.
heaven forbid.
i will take my chance on a beautiful stranger.

i looked into your eyes.
and my world came tumbling down.
you are the devil in disguise.
thats why i am singing this song.

bridge.

to know you is to love you.
you are everywhere i go.
and everybody knows.

to love you is to be part of you.
i have paid for you with tears.
and swallowed all my pride.

chorus.

da da da dum da dum da dum da da da da dum.

da da da dum da dum da dum da da da da dum.

if i am smart then i will run away.
but i am not so i guess i will stay.

i fell in love with a beautiful stranger.

i looked into your face.
my heart was dancing all over the place.
id like to change my point of view.
if i could just forget about you.

i looked into your eyes.
