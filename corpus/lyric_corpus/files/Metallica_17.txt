my life suffocates.
planting the seeds of hate.
i have loved, turned to hate.
trapped far beyond my fate.

i give.
you take.
this life that i forsake.
been cheated of my youth.
you turned this lie to truth.

anger.
misery.
you will suffer unto me.
harvester of sorrow.
language of the mad.
harvester of sorrow.

pure black looking clear.
my work is done soon here.
try getting back to me.
get back what used to be.

drink up.
shoot in.
let the beatings begin.
distributor of pain.
your loss becomes my gain.

anger.
misery.
you will suffer unto me.
harvester of sorrow.
language of the mad.
harvester of sorrow.

all have said their prayers.
invade their nightmares.
to see into my eyes.
you will find where murder lies.
infanticide.

harvester of sorrow.
language of the mad.
harvester of sorrow.
language of the mad.
harvester of sorrow.
