i do not know why i am frightened.
i know my way around here.
the cardboard trees, the painted seas, the sound here...
yes, a world to rediscover.
but i m not in any hurry.
and i need a moment.

the whispered conversations in overcrowded hallways.
the atmosphere as thrilling here as always.
feel the early morning madness.
feel the magic in the making.
why, everythings as if we never said goodbye.

i have spent so many mornings just trying to resist you.
i am trembling now, you can not know how i have missed you.
missed the fairy tale adventure.
in this ever spinning playground.
we were young together.

i am coming out of make up.
the lights already burning.
not long until the cameras will start turning...
and the early morning madness.
and the magic in the making.
yes, everythings as if we never said goodbye.

i do not want to be alone.
thats all in the past.
this worlds waited long enough.
i have come home at last!

and this time will be bigger.
and brighter than we knew it.
so watch me fly, we all know i can do it...
could i stop my hand from shaking?
has there ever been a moment.
with so much to live for?

the whispered conversations in overcrowded hallways.
so much to say not just today but always...
we will have early morning madness.
we will have magic in the making.
yes, everythings as if we never said goodbye.
yes, everythings as if we never said goodbye...
we taught the world new ways to dream!
