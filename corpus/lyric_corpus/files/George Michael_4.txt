i feel so unsure.
as i take your hand and lead you to the dance floor.
as the music dies, something in your eyes.
calls to mind a silver screen.
and all its sad goodbyes.

i am never gonna dance again.
guilty feet have gotten no rhythm.
though its easy to pretend.
i know you are not a fool.

i should have known better than to cheat a friend.
and waste the chance that i have been given.
so i am never gonna dance again.
the way i danced with you.

time can never mend.
the careless whispers of a good friend.
to the heart and mind.
ignorance is kind.
theres no comfort in the truth.
pain is all you will find.

i am never gonna dance again.
guilty feet have got no rhythm.
though its easy to pretend.
i know you are not a fool.

i should have known better than to cheat a friend.
and waste the chance that i have been given.
so i am never gonna dance again.
the way i danced with you.

tonight the music seems so loud.
i wish that we could lose this crowd.
maybe its better this way.
wed hurt each other with the things wed wanna say.

we could have been so good together.
we could have lived this dance forever.
but now whos gonna dance with me?
please stay.

and i am never gonna dance again.
guilty feet have got no rhythm.
though its easy to pretend.
i know you are not a fool.

i should have known better than to cheat a friend.
and waste the chance that i have been given.
so i am never gonna dance again.
the way i danced with you.

now that you are gone now that you are gone.
now that you are gone was what i did so wrong, so wrong.
that you had to leave me alone.
