thinking of an age old dream.
places i have never seen.
fantasies lived times before.
i split my brain, melt through the floor.

over clouds my mind will fly.
forever now i can not think why.
my body tries to leave my soul.
is it me? i just do not know.

memories rising from the past.
the future shadows overcast.
somethings clutching at my head.
through the darkness i will be led.

oh another time, another place.
oh well another smile on another face.
when you see me floating up beside you.
you get the feeling that all my loves inside of you.

guitar solo.

please take me away.
take me away.
so far away.

please take me away.
take me away.
so far away.

please take me away.
take me away.
so far away.
