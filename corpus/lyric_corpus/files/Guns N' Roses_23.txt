it aingt easy living like a gypsy.
tell ya, honey, how it feels.
i have been dreaming floating down stream.
and losing touch with all thats real.
whole lotta lover, keeping undercover.
never knowing where you been oo yeah.
you have been fading, always out parading.
keep in touch with mama kin!

you always got your tail on the wag.
spitting fire from your mouth.
just like a dragon.
you act like a perpetual drag.
you better check it out.
cause someday soon.
you will have to climb back on the wagon.

it aingt easy living like you wanna.
its so hard to find piece of mind.
yes it is.
the way i see it.
you got to say shit.
but do not forget to drop me a line.

bald as an egg at eighteen.
and working for daddys such a drag.
you still stuff your mouth.
with his beans.
you better check it out or someday soon.
you will have to climb back on the wagon.

keep in touch with mama kin.
tell her where you gone and been.
living out your fantasy.
sleeping late and smoking tea.
keep in touch with mama kin.
tell her where you gone and been.
living out your fantasy.
sleeping late and sucking me, oh no.
