somethings on my mind.
its been for quite some time.
this time i am on to you.
so wheres the other face?
the face i heard before.
your head trips boring me.

let us nuke the bridge we torched.
2,000 times before.
this time we will blast it all to hell.
i have had this burning in my guts now for so long.
my bellys aching now to say.

stuck down in a rut of dilogic and smut.
a side of you well hid.
when its all said and done its real and its been fun.
but was it all real fun.

let us nuke the bridge we torched.
2,000 times before.
this time we will blast it all to hell.
i have had this burning in my guts now for so long.
my bellys aching now to say.

to say...

you are just a fuck.
i can not explain it cause i think you suck.
i am taking pride.
in telling you to fuck off and die.

i have had this burning in my guts now.
for so long.
my bellys aching now to say.
i am taking pleasure in the doubts.
i have passed to you.
so listen up as you bite this.

you are just a fuck.
i can not explain it cause i think you suck.
i am taking pride.
in telling you to fuck off and die.

good night.
