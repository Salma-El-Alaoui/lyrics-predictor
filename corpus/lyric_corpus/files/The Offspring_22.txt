i am waiting on a mountaintop.
for the moment that the sky will strike.
my apologies are forever lost.
soon to ashes in a flash of light.

miles away from me.
hope is fading soon.
gone forever its a waste of time.
my intentions like a sweeter room.
only bring to me a fading light.

locked up forever inside.
i look to the stars and ask why.
oh, if they could just teach my dark heart to feel.
all i have saved oh why.
is thrown away.

i am waning like a single bloom.
lost forever in the storm of life.
my intentions like a sweeter room.
only bring to me a fading light.

locked up forever inside.
i look to the stars and ask why.
oh if they could just show these wounds how to heal.

here i am oh, why.
my last stand oh, why.
and i know for all the rising and falling theres nothing to show.

throw me down, throw me down, throw me down...

its been raining.
and now i will pay.
woe has come to me.
i am the lightning rod.

i am waiting.
on a mountaintop.
oh, above me.
he will strike me.

locked up forever inside.
i look to the stars and ask why.
oh if they could just teach my dark heart to feel.

all i am oh, why.
my last stand oh, why.
and i know for all the rising and falling theres nothing to show.
