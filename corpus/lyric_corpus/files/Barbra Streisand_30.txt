could be?
who knows?
theres something due any day.
i will know, right away.
soon as it shows.
it may come connanballing down.
through the sky.
gleam in its eye, bright as rose.
who knows?
its only just out of reach.
down the block, on the beach.
under a tree.
i got a feeling theres a miracle due.
gonna come true, coming to me...
could it be, yes it could.
somethings coming, something good.
if i can wait.
somethings coming.
i do not know what it is.
but it is gonna be great.
with a click, with a shock.
phone will jingle, door will knock.
open the latch.
somethings coming.
do not know when.


but its soon.
catch the moon.
one handed catch.
around the corner.
or whistling down the river.
come on, deliver to me.
will it be, yes it will.
maybe just by holding still.
it will be there.
come on, something.
come on in.
do not be shy.
meet a guy.
pull up a chair.
the air is humming.
and something great is coming.
i feel like drumming.
and something great is coming.
who knows?
its only just out of reach.
down the block, on a beach.
maybe tonight...
maybe tonight...
maybe tonight...!
