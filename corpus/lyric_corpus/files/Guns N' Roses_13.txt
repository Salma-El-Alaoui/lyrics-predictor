all i need is some inspiration.
before i do somebody some harm.
i feel just like a vegetable.
down here on the farm.

nobody comes to see me.
nobody here to turn me on.
i aingt even got a lover.
down here on the farm.

they told me to get healthy.
they told me to get some sun.
but boredom eats me like cancer.
down here on the farm.

drinking lemonade shanty.
aingt nobody here to do me harm.
but i am like a fish out of water.
down here on the farm.

i wrote a thousand letters.
till my fingers all gone numb.
but i never see no postman.
down here on the farm.

i call my baby on the telephone, i say.
come down and have some fun.
but she knows what the score is.
down here on the farm.

i can not fall in love with a wheatfield.
i can not fall in love with a barn.
well everything smells like horse shit.
down here on the farm.

blue skies and swimming pools.
add so much charm.
but id rather be back in soho.
than down here on the farm.

on the fucking farm !

are you born in a fucking barn or what ?

beeeee !
hold still.
