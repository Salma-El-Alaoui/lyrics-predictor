love soft as an easy chair.
love fresh as the morning air.
one love that is shared by two.
i have found with you.

like a rose under the april snow.
i was always certain love would grow.
love ageless and evergreen.
seldom seen by two.

you and i will make each night a first.
every day a beginning.
spirits rise and their dance is unrehearsed.
they warm and excite us, cause we have the brightest love.

two lives that shine as one.
morning glory and midnight sun.
time weve learned to sail above.
time wont change the meaning of one love.
ageless and ever evergreen.
