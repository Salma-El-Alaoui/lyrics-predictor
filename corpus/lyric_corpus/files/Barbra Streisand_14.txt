i have dreamed of you.
always feeling you.
were there.
and all my life.
i have searched for you.
everywhere.
i caught your smile.
in the morning sun.
i heard your whisper.
on the breeze of night.
i prayed one day.
that your arms would hold me tight.

and just when i.
thought love had passed me by.
we met.
that first look.
in your eyes.
i can not forget.
you melted me.
with your tender touch.
i felt all fear and sorrow.
slip away.
now here we stand.
hand in hand.


this blessed day.

i promise you.
as i give to you.
my heart.
that nothing in this world.
shall keep us apart.
come happily ever after be.
the woman i will love.
until the very end.
i have dreamed of you.
my great love.
and my best friend.

for god must know.
how i love you so.
hes blessed us here today.
as man and wife.
come dream with me.
as i have dreamed of you.
all my life.

come dream with me.
as i have dreamed of you.
all my life.
