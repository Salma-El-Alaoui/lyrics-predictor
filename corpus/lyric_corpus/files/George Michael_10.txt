thats all i wanted.
something special, something sacred.
in your eyes.
for just one moment.
to be bold and naked.
at your side.
sometimes i think that you will never.
understand me.
maybe this time is forever.
say it can be.

thats all you wanted.
something special, someone sacred.
in your life.
just for one moment.
to be warm and naked.
at my side.

sometimes i think that you will never.
understand me.
but something tells me together.
wed be happy.

baby.
i will be your father figure.
oh baby.
put your tiny hand in mine.
id love to.
i will be your preacher teacher.
be your daddy.
anything you have in mind.
it would make me.
i will be your father figure.
very happy.
i have had enough of crime.
please let me.
i will be the one who loves you.
until the end of time.

thats all i wanted.
but sometimes love can be mistaken.
for a crime.
thats all i wanted just to see my babys.
blue eyed shine.

this time i think that my lover.
understands me.
if we have faith in each other.
then we can be strong.

i will be your father figure.
put your tiny hand in mine.
i will be your preacher teacher.
anything you have in mind.
i will be your father figure.
i have had enough of crime.
i will be the one who loves you.
until the end of time.

if you are the desert ,i will be the sea.
if you ever hunger, hunger for me.
whatever you ask for, thats what i will be.

so when you remember the ones who have lied.
who said that they cared.
but then laughed as you cried.
beautiful darling.
do not think of me.
because all i ever wanted.
its in your eyes baby, baby.
and love can not lie, no...
greet me with the eyes of a child.
my love is always telling me so...
heaven is a kiss and a smile.
just hold on, hold on.
i will not let you go, my baby.

i will be your father figure.
put your tiny hand in mine.
i will be your preacher teacher.
anything you have in mind.
i will be your father figure.
i have had enough of crime.
so i am gonna love you.
until the end of time.
i will be your father.
i will be your preacher.
i will be your daddy.
i will be the one who loves you until the end of time.
