we have done four already but now we are steady, and then they went one, two, three, four.

singing in the sunshine, laughing in the rain.
hitting on the moonshine, rocking in the grain.
got no time to pack my bag, my foots outside the door.
i got a date, i can not be late, for the high hopes hailla ball.

singing to an ocean, i can hear the oceans roar.
play for free and play for me and play a whole lot more, more.
singing about good things and the sun that lights the day.
i used to sing on the mountains, has the ocean lost its way.

la la la la la la la la la la la la la la lahh.
la la la la la la la la la la la la la la lah.
la la la la la la la la la la la la la la lahh.
la la la la la la la la la la la la la la lah.

sitting round singing songs til the night turns into day.
used to sing on the mountains, but the mountains washed away.
now i am singing all my songs to the girl who won my heart.
she is only three years old and its a real fine way to start.
