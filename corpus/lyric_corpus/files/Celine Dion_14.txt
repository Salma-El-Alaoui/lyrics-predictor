used to be that i believed in something.
used to be that i believed in love.
its been a long time since i have had that feeling.
i could love someone.
i could trust someone.
i said id never let nobody near my heart again darling.
i said id never let nobody in.

but if you asked me to.
i just might change my mind.
and let you in my life forever.
if you asked me to.
i just might give my heart.
and stay here in your arms forever.
if you asked me to.
if you asked me to.

somehow ever since i have been around you.
ca not go back to being on my own.
ca not help feeling darling since i have found you.
that i have found my home.
that i am finally home.
i said id never let nobody get too close to me darling.
i said i needed, needed to be free.

but if you asked me to.
i just might change my mind.
and let you in my life forever.
if you asked me to.
i just might give my heart.
and stay here in your arms forever.
if you asked me to.

if you asked me to, i will give my world to you baby.
i need you now.
asked me to and i will do anything for you baby, for you baby.

if you asked me to.
id let you in my life forever.
if you asked me to.
all you got to do is asked me to.
all you got to do.
all you got to do.
all you got to do is asked me to.

if you asked me to.
i will give you my world.
i will give you my heart.
everything, everything, baby.
if you asked me to.
just asked me to.
i will give you everything you want me to do.
just asked me to..
