have you met miss jones.
someone said as we shook hands.
she was just miss jones to me.

then i said miss jones.
you are a girl who understands.
i am a man who must be free.

and all at once i lost my breath.
and all at once was scared to death.
and all at once i own the earth and sky.

now i met miss jones.
and well keep on meeting till we die.
miss jones and i.
