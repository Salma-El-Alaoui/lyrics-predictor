from the window of your rented limousine, i saw your pretty blue eyes.
one day soon you are gonna reach sixteen, painted lady in the city of lies.

oh, do you know my name? do i look the same.
you know i am the one you want. i must be the one you need, yeah.

clutching pages from your teenage dream in the lobby of the hotel paradise.
through the circus of the l.a. queens. how fast your learn the downhill side.

oh, do you know my name? do i look the same.
you know i am the one you want. i must be the one you need,.

lips like cherries and the brow of a queen, come on, flash it in my eyes.
said you dug me since you were thirteen,then you giggle as you heave and sigh.

oh, do you know my name? do i look the same.
you know i am the one you want. i must be the one you need.

hours, hours, and the moments in between, oh, baby, i could not count the times.
the fun of coming, oh the pain in leaving, baby, dry those silver eyes.

oh, do you know my name? do i look the same.
you know i am the one you want. i must be the one you need.

ooh, thats right..
