i never knew perfection till.
i heard you speak and now it kills me.
just to hear you say the simple things.

now waking up is hard to do.
and sleepings impossible too.
everythings reminding me of you.
what can i do?

its not right not ok.
say the word that you say.
maybe we are better off this way?
i am not fine i am in pain.
its harder everyday.
maybe we are better off this way?
its better that we break.

a fool to let you slip away.
i chase you just to hear you say.
you are scared and that you think that i am insane.

the city looks so nice from here.
a pity i can not see it clearly.
while you are standing there it disappears.
it disappears.

its not right not ok.
say the word that you say.
maybe we are better off this way?
i am not fine i am in pain.
its harder everyday.
maybe we are better off this way?
its better that we break up.

saw you sitting all alone.
you are fragile and you are cold but thats alright.
life these days is getting rough.
it knocks you down and beats you up.
but its just a rollercoaster anyway.

its not right not ok.
say the word that you say.
maybe we are better off this way?
i am not fine i am in pain.
its harder everyday.
maybe we are better off this way?
i am not fine not ok.
say the word that you say.
maybe we are better off this way?
i am not fine i am in pain.
its harder everyday.
maybe we are better off this way?
its better that we break baby.
