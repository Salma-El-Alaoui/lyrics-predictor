from the coast of gold, across the seven seas.
i am travelling on, far and wide.
but now it seems, i am just a stranger to myself.
and all the things i sometimes do, it is not me but someone else.

i close my eyes, and think of home.
another city goes by, in the night.
aingt it funny how it is, you never miss it til its gone away.
and my heart is lying there and will be til my dying day.

chorus.
so understand.
do not waste your time always searching for those wasted years.
face up... make your stand.
and realise you are living in the golden years.

too much time on my hands, i got you on my mind.
ca not ease this pain, so easily.
when you can not find the words to say, its hard to make it through another day.
and it makes me wanna cry, and throw my hands up to the sky.

repeat chorus x 2.

face up... make your stand.
and realise you are living in the golden years.
