fear me, you lords and lady preachers.
i descend upon your earth from the skies.
i command your very souls, you unbelievers.
bring before me what is mine.
the seven seas of rhye.

can you hear me, you peers and privy councilors.
i stand before you naked to the eyes.
i will destroy any man who dares abuse my trust.
i swear that you'll be mine.
the seven seas of rhye.

(sister) i live and lie for you.
(mister) do and i'll die.
you are mine, i possess you.
belong to you forever (ever, ever, ahh).

storm the master marathon i'll fly through.
by flash and thunder fire i'll survive.
(i'll survive, i'll survive) then i'll defy the laws of nature.
and come out alive.
(then i'll get you).

begone with you you shod and shady senators.
give out the good, leave out the bad evil cries.
i challenge the mighty titan and his troubadours.
and with a smile.
i'll take you to the seven seas of rhye.

i'd like to be beside the seaside.
i'd like to be beside the sea.
where the brass drums play.
i'd like to be beside the seaside.
i'd like to be beside the sea
