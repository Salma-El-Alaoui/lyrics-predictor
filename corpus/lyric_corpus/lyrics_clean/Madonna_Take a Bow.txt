take a bow, the night is over.
this masquerade is getting older.
lights are low, the curtains down.
there's no one here.
[there's no one here, there's no one in the crowd].
say your lines but do you feel them.
do you mean what you say when there's no one around [no one around].
watching you, watching me, one lonely star.
[one lonely star you don't know who you are].

chorus:.

i've always been in love with you [always with you].
i guess you've always known it's true [you know it's true].
you took my love for granted, why oh why.
the show is over, say good-bye.

say good-bye [bye bye], say good-bye.

make them laugh, it comes so easy.
when you get to the part.
where you're breaking my heart [breaking my heart].
hide behind your smile, all the world loves a clown.
[just make 'em smile the whole world loves a clown].
wish you well, i cannot stay.
you deserve an award for the role that you played [role that you played].
no more masquerade, you're one lonely star.
[one lonely star and you don't know who you are].

(chorus, repeat).

say good-bye [bye bye], say good-bye.

all the world is a stage [world is a stage].
and everyone has their part [has their part].
but how was i to know which way the story'd go.
how was i to know you'd break.
[you'd break, you'd break, you'd break].
you'd break my heart.

i've always been in love with you.
[i've always been in love with you].
guess you've always known.
you took my love for granted, why oh why.
the show is over, say good-bye.

say good-bye [bye bye], say good-bye.
say good-bye
