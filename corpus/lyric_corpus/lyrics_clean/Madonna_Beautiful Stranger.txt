yeah baby hahahaha.
hello austin.
hey basil how are you.
we need your help.
someone is seducing our top agents.
as you can see, she is a master of disguise.
hoo hoo hoo hoo, oh.
but austin, whatever you do.
don't fall in love.
we've already lost 007 and 008.
well then basil this looks like a case.

haven't we met.
you're some kind of beautiful stranger.
you could be good for me.
i've had the taste for danger.

if i'm smart then i'll run away.
but i'm not so i guess i'll stay.
heaven forbid.
i'll take my chance on a beautiful stranger.

i looked into your eyes.
and my world came tumbling down.
you're the devil in disguise.
that's why i'm singing this song.

bridge:.

to know you is to love you.
you're everywhere i go.
and everybody knows.

to love you is to be part of you.
i've paid for you with tears.
and swallowed all my pride.

chorus:.

da-da-da-dum da-dum da-dum da da da-da dum.
beautiful stranger.
da-da-da-dum da-dum da-dum da da da-da dum.
beautiful stranger.

if i'm smart then i'll run away.
but i'm not so i guess i'll stay.
haven't you heard.
i fell in love with a beautiful stranger.

i looked into your face.
my heart was dancing all over the place.
i'd like to change my point of view.
if i could just forget about you.

(bridge).

i looked into your eyes.
and my world came tumbling down.
you're the devil in disguise.
that's why i'm singing this song to you.

(bridge).

i've paid for you with tears.
and swallowed all my pride.

(chorus)
