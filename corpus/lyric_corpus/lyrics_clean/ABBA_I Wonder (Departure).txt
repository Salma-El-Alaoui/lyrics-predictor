i wonder.
playing with those memories again.
and just when i thought time had set me free.
those thoughts of you keep taunting me.
holding you.
a feeling i never outgrew.
though each and every part of me has tried.
only you can fill that space inside.
so there's no sense pretending.
my heart it's not mending.
** just when i thought i was over you.
and just when i thought i.
could stand on my own.
oh baby those memories come crashing through.
and i just can't go on without you.
( and i just can't go on without.
go on without.
it's just no good without you ).
on my own.
i've tried to make the best of it alone.
i've done everything i can to ease the pain.
but only you can stop the rain.
i just can't live without you.
i miss everything about you.
