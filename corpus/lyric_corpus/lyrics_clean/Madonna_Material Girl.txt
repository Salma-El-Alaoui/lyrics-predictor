some boys kiss me, some boys hug me.
i think they're o.k.
if they don't give me proper credit.
i just walk away.

they can beg and they can plead.
but they can't see the light, that's right, that's right.
'cause the boy with the cold hard cash.
is always mister right.
'cause we are.

chorus:.

living in a material world.
and i am a material girl.
you know that we are living in a material world.
and i am a material girl.

some boys romance, some boys slow dance.
that's all right with me.
if they can't raise my interest then i.
have to let them be.

some boys try and some boys lie but.
i don't let them play, no way, no way.
only boys that save their pennies.
make my rainy day,.
'cause they are.

(chorus).

living in a material world [material].
living in a material world.
(repeat).

boys may come and boys may go.
and that's all right you see.
experience has made me rich.
and now they're after me, 'cause everybody's.

(chorus).

a material, a material, a material, a material world.

living in a material world [material].
living in a material world.
(repeat and fade)
