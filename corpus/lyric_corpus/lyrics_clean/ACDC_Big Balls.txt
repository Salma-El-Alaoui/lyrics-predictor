well i'm upper-upper class high society.
god's gift to ballroom notoriety.
and i always fill my ballroom.
the event is never small.
the social pages say i've got.
the biggest balls of all.

i've got big balls.
i've got big balls.
and they're such big balls.
fancy big balls.
and he's got big balls.
and she's got big balls.
(but we've got the biggest balls of them all).

and my balls are always bouncing.
my ballroom always full.
and everybody comes and comes again.
if your name is on the guest list.
no one can take you higher.
everybody says i've got.
great balls of fire.

i've got big balls.
oh i've got big balls.
and they're such big balls.
fancy big balls.
and he's got big balls.
and she's got big balls.
(but we've got the biggest balls of them all).

some balls are held for charity.
and some for fancy dress.
but when they're held for pleasure.
they're the balls that i like best.
my balls are always bouncing.
to the left and to the right.
it's my belief that my big balls.
should be held every night.

we've got big balls.

(but we've got the biggest balls of them all).
