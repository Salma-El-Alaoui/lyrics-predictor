in the misty moonlight.
by the flickering firelight.
any place is all right.
long as i'm with you.

in a far away land.
on a tropic sea sand.
if your hand's in my hand.
i won't be blue.

way up on a mountain.
way down in a valley.
i know i'll be happy.
any place anywhere.
i don't care.

in the misty moonlight.
by the flickering firelight.
any place is all right.
long as you are there.

in the misty moonlight.
by the flickering firelight.
any place is all right.
long as i'm with you.
in a far away land.
on a tropic sea sand.
if your hand's in my hand.
i won't be blue.

way up on a mountain.
way down in a valley.
i know i'll be happy.
any place anywhere.
i don't care.
in the misty moonlight.
by the flickering firelight.
any place is all right.
long as you are there.

in the misty moonlight.
by the flickering firelight.
any place is all right.
long as i'm with you.

in the misty moonlight.
by the flickering firelight....
