all or nothing at all.
half a love, never appealed to me.
if your heart, never could yield to me.
then i'd rather (rather) have nothing at all.

all or nothing at all.
if it's love, there is no in between.
why begin then cry, for something that might have been.
no i'd rather (rather) have nothing at all.

but please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek.
don't smile or i'll be lost beyond recall.
the kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak.
and my heart may go dizzy and fall.

and if i fell (i fell) under the spell of your call.
i would be, caught in the undertow.
so you see, i've got to say no, no.
all or nothing at all
