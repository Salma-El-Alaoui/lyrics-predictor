everybody screamed.
when i kissed the teacher.
and they must have thought they dreamed.
when i kissed the teacher.
all my friends at school.
they had never seen the teacher blush, he looked like a fool.

nearly petrified 'cos he was taken by surprise.
when i kissed the teacher.
couldn't quite believe his eyes.
when i kissed the teacher.
my whole class went wild.
as i held my breath, the world stood still, but then he just smiled.
i was in the seventh heaven.
when i kissed the teacher.

one of these days.
gonna tell him i dream of him every night.
one of these days.
gonna show him i care, gonna teach him a lesson alright.

i was in a trance when i kissed the teacher.
suddenly i took the chance when i kissed the teacher.
leaning over me, he was trying to explain the laws of geometry.
and i couldn't help it.
i just had to kiss the teacher.

one of these days.
gonna tell him i dream of him every night.
one of these days.
gonna show him i care.
gonna teach him a lesson alright.

what a crazy day.
when i kissed the teacher.
all my sense had flown away.
when i kissed the teacher.
my whole class went wild.
as i held my breath, the world stood still, but then he just smiled.
i was in the seventh heaven.
when i kissed the teacher.

when i kissed the teacher.
(i wanna hug, hug, hug him).
when i kissed the teacher.
(i wanna hug, hug him).
when i kissed the teacher.
(i wanna hug, hug, hug him).
when i kissed the teacher.
(i wanna hug, hug him).
when i kissed the teacher.
(i wanna hug, hug, hug him)
