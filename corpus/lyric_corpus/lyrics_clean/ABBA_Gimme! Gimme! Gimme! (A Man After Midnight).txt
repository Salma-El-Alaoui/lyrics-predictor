half past twelve.
and i'm watching the late show in my flat all alone.
how i hate to spend the evening on my own.
autumn leaves.
blowing outside the window as i look around the room.
and it makes me so depressed to see the gloom.

there's not a soul out there.
no one to hear my prayer.

gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight.
won't somebody help me chase the shadows away.
gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight.
take me through the darkness to the break of the day.

movie stars.
find the end of the rainbow with a fortune to win.
it's so different from the world i'm living in.
tired of tv.
i open the window and i gaze into the night.
but there's nothing there to see no one in sight.

there's not a soul out there.
no one to hear my prayer.

gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight.
won't somebody help me chase the shadows away.
gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight.
take me through the darkness to the break of the day.

gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight.
gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight.

there's not a soul out there.
no one to hear my prayer.

gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight.
won't somebody help me chase the shadows away.
gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight.
take me through the darkness to the break of the day
