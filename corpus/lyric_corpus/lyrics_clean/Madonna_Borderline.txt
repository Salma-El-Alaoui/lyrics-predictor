something in the way you love me won't let me be.
i don't want to be your prisoner so baby won't you set me free.
stop playing with my heart.
finish what you start.
when you make my love come down.
if you want me let me know.
baby let it show.
honey don't you fool around.

just try to understand, i've given all i can,.
'cause you got the best of me.

chorus:.

borderline feels like i'm going to lose my mind.
you just keep on pushing my love over the borderline.

(repeat chorus again).

keep on pushing me baby.
don't you know you drive me crazy.
you just keep on pushing my love over the borderline.

something in your eyes is makin' such a fool of me.
when you hold me in your arms you love me till i just can't see.
but then you let me down, when i look around, baby you just can't be found.
stop driving me away, i just wanna stay,.
there's something i just got to say.

just try to understand, i've given all i can,.
'cause you got the best of me.

(chorus).

keep on pushing me baby.
don't you know you drive me crazy.
you just keep on pushing my love over the borderline.

look what your love has done to me.
come on baby set me free.
you just keep on pushing my love over the borderline.
you cause me so much pain, i think i'm going insane.
what does it take to make you see?.
you just keep on pushing my love over the borderline
