(choir: rio bravo, humming).
by the river.
rio bravo.
i walk all alone.
and i wonder as i wander by the river.
where my love has flown.

all the birds in the cottonwood above her.
know i love her.
know i care.
but my dreams, like the songs, she sang in spanish.
seem to vanish.
in the air.

i wonder where.

so i wonder as i wander.
will love come along.
must i live ever after.
by the memory of her song.

while the river rio bravo flows along.
(choir: rio bravo, rio bravo).
while the river rio bravo flows along.
