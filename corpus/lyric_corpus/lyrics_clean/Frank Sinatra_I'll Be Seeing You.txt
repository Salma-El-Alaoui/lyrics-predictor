i'll be seeing you.
in all the old familiar places.
that this heart of mine embraces.
all day through.

in that small cafe.
the park across the way.
the children's carousel.
and the chestnut trees.
the wishing well.

and i'll be seeing you.
in every lovely summer's day.
and everything that's bright and gay.
i'll always think of you that way.
i'll find you in the morning sun.
and when the night is new.
i'll be looking at the moon.
but i'll be seeing you.

i'll be seeing you.
in every lovely summer's day.
in everything that's bright and gay.
i'll always think of you that way.
i'll find you in the morning sun.
and when the night is new.
i'll be looking at the moon.
but i'll be seeing you
