buona sera senorina buona sera.
it is time to say good night to napoli.
though it's hard for us to whisper buona sera.
without the moon above the mediterranean sea.

in the morning senorina we'll go walkin.
with the mountains at the moon coming at the side.
and by the little jewelly shop we'll stop and linger.
while i will buy wedding ring for your finger.
in the meantime let me tell you thati love you.
buona sera senorina kiss me good night.
buona sera senorina kiss me good night.

[chorus].
buona sera senorina, buona sera.
it's time to say good night to napoli.
though it's hard for us to whisper buona sera.
without the moon above the meditteranean sea.

in the morning senorina we'll go walkin.
with the mountains at the moon coming at the side.
and by the little jewelly shop we'll stop ringer.
while i will buy wedding ring for your finger.
in the meantime let me tell you that i love you.
buona sera senorina kiss me good night
