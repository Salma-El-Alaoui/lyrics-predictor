you make me feel so young.
you make me feel like spring has sprung.
every time i see you grin.
i'm such a happy individual.

the moment that you speak.
i want to go and play hide-and-seek.
i want to go and bounce the moon.
just like a toy balloon.

you and i, are just like a couple of tots.
running across the meadow.
picking up lots of forget-me-nots.

you make me feel so young.
you make me feel there are songs to be sung.
bells to be rung, and a wonderful fling to be flung.

and even when i'm old and gray.
i'm gonna feel the way i do today.
'cause you make me feel so young
