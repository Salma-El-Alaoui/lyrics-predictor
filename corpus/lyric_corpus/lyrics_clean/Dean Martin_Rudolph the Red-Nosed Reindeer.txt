rudolph the red-nosed reindeer.
had a very shiny nose,.
and if you ever saw it,.
you could even say it glows.

all of the other reindeer.
used to laugh and call him names;.
they never let poor rudolph.
join in any reindeer games.

then one foggy christmas eve,.
santa came to say:.
"rudolph with your nose so bright,.
won’t you guide my sleigh tonight?".
then how the reindeer loved him.
as they shouted out with glee,.
"rudolph the red-nosed reindeer,.
you’ll go down in history."
