i have a tale to tell.
sometimes it gets so hard to hide it well.
i was not ready for the fall.
too blind to see the writing on the wall.

a man can tell a thousand lies.
i've learned my lesson well.
hope i live to tell.
the secret i have learned.
'till then, it will burn inside of me.

i know where beauty lives.
i've seen it once, i know the warmth she gives.
the light that you could never see.
it shines inside, you can't take that from me.

a man can tell a thousand lies.
i've learned my lesson well.
hope i live to tell.
the secret i have learned.
'till then, it will burn inside of me.

the truth is never far behind.
you've kept it hidden well.
if i live to tell the secret i knew then.
will i ever have the chance again?.

if i ran away.
i'd never have the strength.
to go very far.
how would they hear the beating of my heart?.
will it grow cold, the secret that i hide?.
will i grow old?.
how will they hear?.
when will they learn?.
how will they know...?.

a man can tell a thousand lies.
i've learned my lesson well.
hope i live to tell.
the secret i have learned.
'till then, it will burn inside of me.

the truth is never far behind.
you've kept it hidden well.
if i live to tell the secret i knew then.
will i ever have the chance again?
