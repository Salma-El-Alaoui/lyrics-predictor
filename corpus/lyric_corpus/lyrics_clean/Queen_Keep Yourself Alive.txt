i was told a million times.
of all the troubles in my way.
tried to grow a little wiser.
little better ev'ry day.
but if i crossed a million rivers.
and i rode a million miles.
then i'd still be where i started.
bread and butter for a smile.
well i sold a million mirrors.
in a shop in alley way.
but i never saw my face.
in any window any day.
well they say your folks are telling you.
to be a superstar.
but i tell you just be satisfied.
to stay right where you are.

keep yourself alive keep yourself alive.
it'll take you all your time and a money.
honey you'll survive.

well i've loved a million women.
in a belladonic haze.
and i ate a million dinners.
brought to me on silver trays.
give me ev'rything i need.
to feed my body and my soul.
and i'll grow a little bigger.
maybe that can be my goal.
i was told a million times.
of all the people in my way.
how i had to keep on trying.
and get better ev'ry day.
but if i crossed a million rivers.
and i rode a million miles.
then i'd still be where i started.
same as when i started.

keep yourself alive keep yourself alive.
it'll take you all your time and a money.
honey you'll survive.

keep yourself alive.

it'll take you all your time and a money.
to keep me satisfied.
