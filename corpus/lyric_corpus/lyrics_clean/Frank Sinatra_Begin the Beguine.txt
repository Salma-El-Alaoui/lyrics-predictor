(cole porter).

when they begin.
the beguine.
it brings back the sound.
of music so tender.
it brings back a night.
of tropical splendor.
it brings back a memory of green.

i'm with you once more.
under the stars.
and down by the shore.
an orchestras playing.
and even the palms.
seem to be swaying.
when they begin.
the beguine.

to live it again.
is past all endeavor.
except when that tune.
clutches my heart.
and there we are swearing to love forever.
and promising never.
never to part.

a moments divine.
what rapture serene.
to clouds came along.
to disperse the joys we had tasted.
and now when i hear people curse the chance that was wasted.
i know but too well what they mean.

so dont let them begin the beguine.
let the love that was once a fire.
remain an ember.
let it sleep like the dead desire i only remember.
when they begin the beguine.

oh yes let them begin the beguine.
make them play.
til the stars that were there before.
return above you.
till you whisper to me.
once more darling i love you.
and we suddenly know what heaven we're in.
when they begin.
the beguine
