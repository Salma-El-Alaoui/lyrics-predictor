ah-ha-ha, ah-aaaah.
ah-ha-ha, ah-aaaah.
ah-ha-ha, keep thinking 'bout his angeleyes.
i keep thinking, a-aaah.

last night i was taking a walk along the river.
and i saw him together with a young girl.
and the look that he gave her made me shiver.
'cause he always used to look at me that way.
then i thought maybe i should walk right up to her and say.
ah-ha-ha, it's a game he likes to play.

look into his angeleyes.
one look and you're hypnotized.
he'll take your heart and you must pay the price.
look into his angeleyes.
you'll think you're in paradise.
and one day you'll find out he wears a disguise.
don't look too deep into those angeleyes.
oh no no no no.

ah-ha-ha, ah-aaaah.
ah-ha-ha, ah-aaaah.
ah-ha-ha, keep thinking 'bout his angeleyes.
i keep thinking, a-aaah.

sometimes when i'm lonely i sit and think about him.
and it hurts to remember all the good times.
when i thought i could never live without him.
and i wonder does it have to be the same.
every time when i see him, will it bring back all the pain?.
ah-ha-ha, how can i forget that name?.

look into his angeleyes.
one look and you're hypnotized.
he'll take your heart and you must pay the price.
look into his angeleyes.
you'll think you're in paradise.
and one day you'll find out he wears a disguise.
don't look too deep into those angeleyes.
crazy 'bout his angeleyes.
angeleyes.
he took my heart and now i pay the price.
look into his angeleyes.
you'll think you're in paradise.
then one day you'll find out he wears a disguise.
don't look too deep into those angeleyes.
oh no no no no.

ah-ha-ha, ah-aaaah.
ah-ha-ha, ah-aaaah.

ah-ha-ha, keep thinking, ah-aaaah.
keep thinking 'bout his angeleyes.
ah-ha-ha, keep thinking, ah-aaaah.
keep thinking, i had to pay the price
