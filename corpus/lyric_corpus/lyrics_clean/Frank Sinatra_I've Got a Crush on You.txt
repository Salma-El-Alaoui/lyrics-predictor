how glad the many millions of annabelles and lillians.
would be to capture me.
but you had such persistence, you wore down my resistance.
i fell and it was swell.

i'm your big and brave and handsome romeo.
how i won you i shall never never know.
it's not that you're attractive.
but, oh, my heart grew active.
when you came into view.

i've got a crush on you, sweetie pie.
all the day and night-time give me sigh.
i never had the least notion that.
i could fall with so much emotion.

could you coo, could you care.
for a cunning cottage we could share.
the world will pardon my mush.
'cause i have got a crush on you.

could you coo, could you care.
for a cunning cottage.

the world will pardon my mush.
'cause i have got a crush, my baby, on you
