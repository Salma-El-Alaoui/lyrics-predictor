dashing through the snow.
in a one-horse open sleigh.
through the fields we go.
laughing all the way.
bells on bob-tail ring.
making spirits bright.
what fun it is to ride and sing.
a sleighing song tonight.

cho: jingle bells, jingle bells.
jingle all the way,.
oh what fun it is to ride.
in a one-horse open sleigh, o.
jingle bells, jingle bells.
jingle all the way,.
oh what fun it is to ride.
in a one-horse open sleigh.

a day or two ago.
i thought i'd take a ride.
and soon miss fanny bright.
was seated by my side;.
the horse was lean and lank.
misfortune seemed his lot,.
we ran into a drifted bank.
and there we got upsot.

a day or two ago.
the story i must tell.
i went out on the snow.
and on my back i fell;.
a gent was riding by.
in a one-horse open sleigh.
he laughed at me as.
i there sprawling laid.
but quickly drove away.

now the ground is white,.
go it while you're young,.
take the girls along.
and sing this sleighing song.
just bet a bob-tailed bay,.
two-forty as his speed,.
hitch him to an open sleigh.
and crack! you'll take the lead.
