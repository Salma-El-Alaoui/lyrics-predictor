standing on a corner watching all the girls go by.
brother you don't know a nicer occupation.
matter of fact, neither do i.
than standing on a corner watching all the girls.
watching all the girls, watching all the girls go by.

i'm the cat that got the cream.
haven't got a girl but i can dream.
haven't got a girl but i can wish.
so i'll take me down to main street.
and that's where i select my imaginary dear.

standing on a corner watching all the girls go by.
standing on a corner giving all the girls the eye.
brother if you've got a rich imagination.
give it a whirl, give it a try.
try standing on a corner watching all the girls.
watching all the girls, watching all the girls go by.

brother you can't go to jail for what you're thinking.
or for that wooed look in your eye.
standing on the corner watching all the girls.
watching all the girls, watching all the girls go by
