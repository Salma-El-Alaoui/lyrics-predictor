my story is much too sad to be told.
but practically everything leaves me totally cold.
the only exception i know is the case.
when i'm out on a quiet spree, fighting vainly the old ennui.
then i suddenly turn and see.
your fabulous face.

chorus:.

i get no kick from champagne.
mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all.

so tell me why should it be true?.
that i get a.
kick! out of you.

[3 different verses for every song].

(some like the perfume from spain).
(i'm sure that if i took even one sniff).
(it would bore me terrifically too).
(but i get a kick out of you).

(some like the bop-type refrain).
(i'm sure that if, i heard even one riff).
(it would bore me terrifically too).
(but i get a kick out of you).

(some they may go for cocaine).
(i'm sure that if, i took even one sniff).
(it would bore me terrifically too).
(but i get a kick out of you).

i get a kick every time i see you standing there before me.
i get a kick though it's clear to see, you obviously do not adore me.

i get no kick in a plane.
flying too high with some gal in the sky.
is my idea of nothing to do.
but i get a kick out of you
