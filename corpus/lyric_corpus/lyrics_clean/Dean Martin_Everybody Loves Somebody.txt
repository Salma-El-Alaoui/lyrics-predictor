everybody loves somebody sometime.
everybody falls in love somehow.
something in your kiss just told me, my sometime is now.
everybody finds somebody someplace.
theres no tellin' where love may appear.
something in my heart keeps sayin'.
my someplace is here.
if i had it in my power, i'd arrange for every girl to have your charm.
then every minute every hour, every boy would find what i found in your arms.
everybody loves somebody sometime.
and although my dream was overdue,.
your love made it well worth waiting.
for someone like you.
