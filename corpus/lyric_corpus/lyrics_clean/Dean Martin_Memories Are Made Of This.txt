(the sweet, sweet memories you've given me.
you can't beat the memories you've given me).
take one fresh and tender kiss,.
add one stolen night of bliss,.
one girl; one boy; some grief; some joy:.

memories are made of this.

don't forget a small moonbeam.
fold it lightly with a dream.
your lips and mine,.
two sips of wine:.

memories are made of this.

then add the wedding bells;.
one house where lovers dwell;.
three little kids for the flavor.
stir carefully through the days ~.
see how the flavor stays.
these are the dreams you will savor.

with his blessings from above,.
serve it generously with love.
one man, one wife,.
one love, through life:.

memories are made of this. (x2)
