if you can use some exotic booze there's a bar in far bombay.
come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away.

come fly with me, let's float down to peru.
in llama-land there's a one man band and he'll toot his flute for you.
come fly with me, let's take off in the blue.

once i get you up there, where the air is rarefied.
we'll just glide, starry eyed.
once i get you up there, i'll be holding you so near.
you may hear, the angels cheer because we're together.

weather-wise it's such a lovely day.
just say the words and we'll beat those birds down to acapulco bay.
it's perfect, for a flying honeymoon they say.
so come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away.
