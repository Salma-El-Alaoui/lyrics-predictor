sometimes when i just can't sleep.
and you're on my mind and i'm hurting deep.
at night, when the sun goes down.
and the lights turn on and you're not around.

i've been this way before.
but it wasn't you do.
this time i'm sure.
i've been waiting for you.

i dream when i call your name.
and i'm in a place that i can't explain.
and everything you see i can't come true.
it's the way that it is.
it's the way that i am through.

i've been this way before.
but it wasn't you do.
this time i'm sure.
i've been waiting for you.
this time i'm sure.
i've been waiting for you.

i've been waiting for you.
i've been waiting for you.
i've been waiting for you
