making somebody happy is a question of give and take.
you can learn how to show it so come on, give yourself a break.
every smile and every little touch.
don't you know that they mean so much.
sweet sweet kisses so tender.
always will return to sender.

like a bang, a boom-a-boomerang.
dum-be-dum-dum be-dum-be-dum-dum.
oh bang, a boom-a-boomerang.
love is a tune you hum-de-hum-hum.
so give it away, i think you'll learn.
you'll get love in return.
so bang, a boom-a-boomerang is love.
a boom-a-boomerang is love.

love is always around and you can look for it anywhere.
when you feel that you've found it my advice is to take good care.
never use it as a selfish tool.
never ever be such a fool.
every feeling you're showing.
is a boomerang you're throwing.

yes a bang, a boom-a-boomerang.
dum-be-dum-dum be-dum-be-dum-dum.
oh bang, a boom-a-boomerang.
love is a tune you hum-de-hum-hum.
so give it away, i think you'll learn.
you'll get love in return.
so bang, a boom-a-boomerang is love.

and if you're warm and tender.
i'll kiss you, return to sender.
please surrender.

bang, a boom-a-boomerang.
dum-be-dum-dum be-dum-be-dum-dum.
oh bang, a boom-a-boomerang is love.
a boom-a-boomerang is love
