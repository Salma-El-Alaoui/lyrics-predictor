people everywhere.
a sense of expectation hangin' in the air.
givin' out a spark.
across the room your eyes are glowin' in the dark.
and here we go again, we know the start, we know the end.
masters of the scene.
we've done it all before and now we're back to get some more.
you know what i mean.

voulez-vous.
take it now or leave it.
now is all we get.
nothing promised, no regrets.
voulez-vous.
ain't no big decision.
you know what to do.
la question c'est voulez-vous.

i know what you think.
the girl means business so i'll offer her a drink.

i see you leave your table, pushin' through the crowd.
i'm really glad you came, you know the rules, you know the game.
master of the scene.
we've done it all before and now we're back to get some more.
you know what i mean.
