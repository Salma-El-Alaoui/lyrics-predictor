(spoken:).
i know you've been waiting, yeah.
i've been watching you, yeah.
i know you wanna get up, yeah.
come on.

chorus:.

everybody, come on, dance and sing.
everybody, get up and do your thing.
everybody, come on, dance and sing.
everybody, get up and do your thing.

let the music take control.
find a groove and let yourself go.
when the room begins to sway.
you know what i'm trying to say.

come on, take a chance.
get up and start the dance.
let the d.j. shake you.
let the music take you.

(chorus).

let your body take a ride.
feel the beat and step inside.
music makes the world go 'round.
you can turn your troubles upside down.

gonna have to change your mind.
gonna leave your troubles behind.
your body gets the notion.
when your feet can make the motion.

(chorus, repeat).

dance and sing, get up and do your thing (repeat 3 times).

(spoken:).
i know you've been waiting, yeah, yeah.
i see you sitting there, i've been watching you.
across the room, yeah, yeah.
i've been watching you, i see you sitting there by yourself.
yeah, yeah.
come on, come on, come on.

(chorus).

let the music take control.
find a groove and let yourself go.
when the room begins to sway.
you know what i'm trying to say.

(chorus, repeat and fade).
