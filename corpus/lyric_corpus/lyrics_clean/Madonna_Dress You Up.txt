you've got style, that's what all the girls say.
satin sheets and luxuries so fine.
all your suits are custom made in london.
but i've got something that you'll really like.

chorus:.

gonna dress you up in my love.
all over, all over.
gonna dress you up in my love.
all over your body.

feel the silky touch of my caresses.
they will keep you looking so brand new.
let me cover you with velvet kisses.
i'll create a look that's made for you.

(chorus).

gonna dress you up in my love, in my love.
all over your body, all over your body.
in my love.
all over, all over.
from your head down to your toes
