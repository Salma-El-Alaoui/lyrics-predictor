those fingers in my hair.
that sly come hither stare.
that strips my conscience bare.
it's witchcraft.

and i've got no defense for it,.
the heat is too intense for it.
what good would common sense for it do?.

'cause it's witchcraft,.
wicked witchcraft,.
and although i know it's strictly taboo.

when you arouse the need in me,.
my heart says yes indeed in me,.
proceed with what your leading me to.

it's such an ancient pitch,.
but one i wouldn't switch,.

'cause there's no nicer witch than you.

**instrumental break**.

'cause it's witchcraft,.
that crazy witchcraft,.
and although i know it's strictly taboo.

when you arouse the need in me,.
my heart says yes indeed in me,.
proceed with what your leading me to...

it's such an ancient pitch,.
but one that i would never switch,.
'cause there's no nicer witch than you
