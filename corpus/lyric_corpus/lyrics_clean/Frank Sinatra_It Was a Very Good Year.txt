when i was seventeen.
it was a very good year.
it was a very good year for small town girls.
and soft summer nights.
we'd hide from the lights.
on the village green.
when i was seventeen.

when i was twenty-one.
it was a very good year.
it was a very good year for city girls.
who lived up the stair.
with all that perfumed hair.
and it came undone.
when i was twenty-one.

when i was thirty-five.
it was a very good year.
it was a very good year for blue-blooded girls.
of independent means.
we'd ride in limousines.
their chauffeurs would drive.
when i was thirty-five.

but now the days are short.
i'm in the autumn of the year.
and now i think of my life as vintage wine.
from fine old kegs.
from the brim to the dregs.
and it poured sweet and clear.
it was a very good year.

it was a massive good year
