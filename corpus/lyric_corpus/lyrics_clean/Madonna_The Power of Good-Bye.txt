your heart is not open, so i must go.
the spell has been broken, i loved you so.
freedom comes when you learn to let go.
creation comes when you learn to say no.

you were my lesson, i had to learn.
i was your fortress, you had to burn.
pain is a warning that something's wrong.
i pray to god that it won't be long.
do you wanna go higher.

there's nothing left to try.
there's no place left to hide.
there's no greater power.
than the power of goodbye.

your heart is not open, so i must go.
the spell has been broken, i loved you so.
you were my lesson, i had to learn.
i was your fortress.

there's nothing left to lose.
there's no more heart to bruise.
there's no greater power.
than the power of goodbye.

learn...to...say...good...bye.
i yearn...to...say...good...bye.

there's nothing left to try.
there's no more places to hide.
there's no greater power.
than the power of goodbye.

there's nothing left to lose.
there's no more heart to bruise.
there's no greater power.
than the power of good-bye
