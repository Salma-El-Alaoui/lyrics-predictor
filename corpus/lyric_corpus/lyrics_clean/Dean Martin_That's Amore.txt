(in napoli where love is king.
when boy meets girl here's what they say).

when the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie.
that's amore.
when the world seems to shine like you've had too much wine.
that's amore.
bells will ring ting-a-ling-a-ling, ting-a-ling-a-ling.
and you'll sing "vita bella".
hearts will play tippy-tippy-tay, tippy-tippy-tay.
like a gay tarantella.

when the stars make you drool just like a pasta e fasul.
that's amore.
when you dance down the street with a cloud at your feet.
you're in love.
when you walk in a dream but you know you're not.
dreaming signore.
scuzzi me, but you see, back in old napoli.
that's amore.
