written by madonna and william orbit.

you took a pretty picture.
and you smashed it into bits.
sank me into blackness.
and you sealed it with a kiss.

if only i could let you go.
why do i need you so.

chorus:.

it's amazing what a boy can do.
i cannot stop myself.
wish i didn't want you like i do.
want you and no one else.

you took a poison arrow.
and you aimed it at my heart.
it's heavy and it's bitter.
and it's tearing me apart.

if only i could set you free.
you worked your way inside of me.

(chorus).

chorus 2:.

it's amazing what a boy can say.
i cannot stop myself.
seems i love you more than yesterday.
love you and no one else.

oh, it's amazing.

(chorus).
(chorus2).

it's amazing.
oh, it's amazing.

i cannot stop myself.
wish i didn't.
love you and no one else
