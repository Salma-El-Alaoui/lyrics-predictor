hey you, yeah you.

sometimes i think this woman is kinda hot.
sometimes i think this woman is sometimes not.
puts me down, fool me around.
why she do it to me.
out for satisfaction.
any piece of action.
that ain't the way it should be.

she needs lovin'.
knows i'm the man.
she's gotta see.
pours my beer.
licks my ear.
brings out the devil in me.
hell ain't a bad place to be.

spends my money.
drinks my booze.
stays out every night.
but i got to thinkin', hey just a minute.
somethin' ain't right.
all this disillusions and confusion.
make me wanna cry.
oh the shame you, playin' your games.
tellin' me those lies.

don't mind her playin' demon.
long as it's with me.
if this is hell.
then you could say.
it's heavenly.
hell ain't a bad place to be.

late at night.
turns down the light.
closes up on me.
opens my heart.
tears me apart.
brings out the devil in me.

hell ain't no bad place to be.
i said hell ain't no bad place to be.
hell ain't no bad place to be.
hell ain't no bad place to be
