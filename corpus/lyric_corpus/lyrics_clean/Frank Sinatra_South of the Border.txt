south of the border - down mexico way.
that's where i fell in love, where the stars above - came out to play.
and now as i wander - my thoughts ever stray.
south of the border - down mexico way.

she was a picture - in old spanish lace.
just for a tender while, i kissed a smile - upon her face.
'cause it was fiesta - and we were so gay.
south of the border - mexico way.

then she smiled as she whispered &amp;quot;manjanna&amp;quot;.
never dreaming that we were parting.
then i lied as a whispered &amp;quot;manjanna&amp;quot;.
'cause our tomorrow never came.

south of the border - i jumped back one day.
there in a veil of white, by the candle light - she knelt to pray.
the mission bells told me (ding-dong) - that i musn't stay.
south of the border - mexico way
