the video game says "play me".
face it on a level but it takes you every time on a one on one.
feeling running down your spine.
nothing gonna save your one last dime cause it owns you.
through and through.

the databank knows my number.
says i gotta pay cause i made the grade last year.
feel it when i turn the screw.
kicks you round the world, there ain't a thing that it can't do.
do to you.

chorus:.
who made who, who made you?.
who made who, ain't nobody told you?.
who made who, who made you?.
if you made them and they made you.
who picked up the bill, who? and who made who?.

who made who, who turned the screw?.

satellites send me picture.
get it in the eye, take it to the world (take it to the wire).
spinning like a dynamo.
feel it going round and round.
running out of chips, you got no line in an 8-bit town.
so don't look down, no.

chorus.

ain't nobody told you, who made who?
