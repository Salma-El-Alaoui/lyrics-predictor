how lucky can one guy be ?.
i kissed her and she kissed me.
like the fella' once said.
ain't that a kick in the head ?.

the room was completely black.
i hugged her and she hugged back.
like the sailor said, quote, ain't that a hole in the boat ?.
my head keeps spinning.
i go to sleep and keep grinning.
if this is just the beginning, my life is gonna' be beautiful.
i've sunshine enough to spread.
it's just like the fella' said.
tell me quick ain't love a kick in the head ?.

she's telling me we'll be wed.
she's picked out a king-size bed.
i couldn't feel any better or i'd be sick.
