open up your mind and let me step inside.
rest your weary head and let your heart decide.
it's so easy when you know the rules.
it's so easy all you have to do.
is fall in love.
play the game.
ev'rybody play the game of love.

when you're feelin' down and your resistance is low.
light another cigarette and let yourself go.
this is your life.
don't play hard to get.
it's a free world.
all you have to do is fall in love.
play the game ev'ryone play the game of love.

my game of love has just begun.
love runs from my head down to my toes.
my love is pumping through my veins (play the game).
driving me insane.
come come come come play the game play the game play the game play the game.

play the game everybody play the game of love.

this is your life - don't play hard to get.
it's a free free world all you have to do is fall in love.

your life - don't play hard to get.
it's a free free world all you have to do is fall in love.
