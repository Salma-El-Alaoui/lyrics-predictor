it's funny that way, you can get used.
to the tears and the pain.
what a child will believe.
you never loved me.

chorus:.

you can't hurt me now.
i got away from you, i never thought i would.
you can't make me cry, you once had the power.
i never felt so good about myself.

seems like yesterday.
i lay down next to your boots and i prayed.
for your anger to end.
oh father i have sinned.

(chorus).

oh father, if you never wanted to live that way.
if you never wanted to hurt me.
why am i running away?.
(repeat).

maybe someday.
when i look back i'll be able to say.
you didn't mean to be cruel.
somebody hurt you too.

(chorus)
