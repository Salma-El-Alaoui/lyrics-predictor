i made it through the wilderness.
somehow i made it through.
didn't know how lost i was.
until i found you.

i was beat incomplete.
i'd been had, i was sad and blue.
but you made me feel.
yeah, you made me feel.
shiny and new.

chorus:.

like a virgin.
touched for the very first time.
like a virgin.
when your heart beats.
next to mine.

gonna give you all my love, boy.
my fear is fading fast.
been saving it all for you.
'cause only love can last.

you're so fine and you're mine.
make me strong, yeah you make me bold.
oh your love thawed out.
yeah, your love thawed out.
what was scared and cold.

(chorus).

oooh, oooh, oooh.

you're so fine and you're mine.
i'll be yours 'till the end of time.
'cause you made me feel.
yeah, you made me feel.
i've nothing to hide.

(chorus).

like a virgin, ooh, ooh.
like a virgin.
feels so good inside.
when you hold me, and your heart beats, and you love me.

oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
ooh, baby.
can't you hear my heart beat.
for the very first time?
