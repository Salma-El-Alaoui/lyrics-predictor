you're just too marvelous, too marvelous for words.
like "glorious", "glamorous" and that old standby "amorous".
it's all too wonderful, i'll never find the words.
that say enough, tell enough, i mean they just aren't swell enough.

you're much too much, and just too "very, very".
to ever be in webster's dictionary.
and so i'm borrowing a love song from the birds.
to tell you that you're marvelous - too marvelous for words.


(musical interlude).

you're much - you're too much - and just too "very, very".
to ever be, to ever be in webster's dictionary.
and so i'm borrowing a love song from the birds.
to tell you that you're marvelous;.
tell you that you're marvelous;.
tell you that you're marvelous - too marvelous for words
