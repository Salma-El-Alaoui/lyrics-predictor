cop this.
i'm hot, and when i'm not.
i'm cold as ice.
get out of my way.
just step aside.
or pay the price.

what i want i take.
what i don't i break.
and i don't want you.
with a flick of my knife.
i can change your life.
there's nothing you can do.

i'm a problem child.
i'm a problem child, yes i am.
i'm a problem child.
and i'm wild.

make my stand.
no man's land.
on my own.
man in blue.
it's up to you.
the seed is sown.

what i want i stash.
what i don't i smash.
and you're on my list.
dead or alive.
i got a .45.
and i never miss.

i'm a problem child, hey.
i'm a problem child.
i'm a problem child.
just runnin' wild.

~(solo)~.

just watch your step.

every night.
street light.
i drink my booze.
some run.
some fight.
but i win they lose.
what i need i like.
what i don't i fight.
and i don't like you.
say bye bye.
while you're still alive.
your time is through.

cause i'm a problem child.
i'm a problem child.
i'm a problem child.
i'm a problem child.
problem child.
i'm a problem child.
even my mother hates me.
i'm a problem child.
i'm a problem child.
(problem child, problem child).
(problem child, problem child), ....
(problem child, problem child).
(problem child, problem child).
problem child.
i'm a problem child.
problem child.
and i'm running wild.
i'm a problem child.
(problem child, problem child...)
