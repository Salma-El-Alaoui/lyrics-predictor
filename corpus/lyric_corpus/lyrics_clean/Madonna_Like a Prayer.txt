god.

life is a mystery, everyone must stand alone.
i hear you call my name.
and it feels like home.

when you call my name it's like a little prayer.
i'm down on my knees, i wanna take you there.
in the midnight hour i can feel your power.
just like a prayer you know i'll take you there.

i hear your voice, it's like an angel sighing.
i have no choice, i hear your voice.
feels like flying.
i close my eyes, oh god i think i'm falling.
out of the sky, i close my eyes.
heaven help me.

when you call my name it's like a little prayer.
i'm down on my knees, i wanna take you there.
in the midnight hour i can feel your power.

just like a prayer you know i'll take you there.
like a child you whisper softly to me.
you're in control just like a child.

now i'm dancing.

it's like a dream, no end and no beginning.
you're here with me, it's like a dream.
let the choir sing.

when you call my name it's like a little prayer.
i'm down on my knees, i wanna take you there.
in the midnight hour i can feel your power.
just like a prayer you know i'll take you there.

when you call my name it's like a little prayer.
i'm down on my knees, i wanna take you there.

just like a prayer you know i'll take you there.

life is a mystery, everyone must stand alone.
i hear you call my name.
and it feels like home.

just like a prayer, your voice can take me there.
just like a muse to me, you are a mystery.
just like a dream, you are not what you seem.
just like a prayer, no choice your voice can take me there.

just like a prayer, i'll take you there.
it's like a dream to me.

just like a prayer, i'll take you there.
it's like a dream to me.

just like a prayer, i'll take you there.
it's like a dream to me.

just like a prayer, i'll take you there.
it's like a dream to me.

just like a prayer, your voice can take me there.
just like a muse to me, you are a mystery.
just like a dream, you are not what you seem.
just like a prayer, no choice your voice can take me there
