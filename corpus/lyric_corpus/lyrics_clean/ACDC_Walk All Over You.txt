outta my way i'm a runnin high.
take your chance with me and i'll give it a try.
ain't no woman in the world i know.
cause i ain't looking for an overflow.
oh baby i ain't got much.
resistance to your touch.
take off the high heels, let down your hair.
paradise ain't far from there.

i wanna walk all over you.
i wanna walk all over you.
do anything you want me to, baby.
i wanna walk all over you.

reflections on the bedroom wall.
and girl you thought you'd seen it all.
we're rising, falling like the sea.
you're looking so good under me.

i'm gonna walk all over you.
i'm gonna walk all over you.
do anything you want me to do to you.
i'm gonna walk all over you.

moanin, groanin stereo.
said gimme the stage, i'm gonna steal the show.
leave on the lace and turn off the light.
tonight is gonna be the night.

i'm gonna walk all over you.
i'm gonna walk all over you.
do anything you want me to.
i'm gonna walk all over you.

ow, i'm gonna walk all over you
