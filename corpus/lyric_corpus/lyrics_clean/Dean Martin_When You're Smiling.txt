when you're smiling.
when you're smiling.
the whole world smiles with you.

when you're laughing.
oh, when you're laughing.
the sun comes shining through.

but when you're crying.
you bring on the rain.
so stop your sighing.
be happy again.
keep on smiling.
'cause when you're smiling.
the whole world smiles with you.

but when you're crying.
you bring on the rain.
so stop your sighing.
be happy again.
keep on smiling.
'cause when you're smiling.
the whole world smiles with you
