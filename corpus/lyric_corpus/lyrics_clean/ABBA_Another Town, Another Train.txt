day is dawning and i must go.
you're asleep but still i'm sure you'll know.
why it had to end this way.
you and i had a groovy time.
but i told you somewhere down the line.
you would have to find me gone.
i just have to move along.
just another town, another train.
waiting in the morning rain.
lord give my restless soul a little patience.
just another town, another train.
nothing lost and nothing gained.
guess i will spend my life in railway stations.
guess i will spend my life in railway stations.

when you wake i know you'll cry.
and the words i wrote to say goodbye.
they won't comfort you at all.
but in time you will understand.
that the dreams we dreamed were made of sand.
for a no-good bum like me.
to live is to be free.

just another town, another train.
waiting in the morning rain.
look in my restless soul, a little patience.
just another town, another train.
nothing lost and nothing gained.
guess i will spend my life in railway stations.
guess i will spend my life in railway stations.
