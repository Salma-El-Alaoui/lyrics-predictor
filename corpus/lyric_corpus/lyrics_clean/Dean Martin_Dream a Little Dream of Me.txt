stars shining bright above you.
night breezes seem to whisper i love you.
birds singing in the sycamore tree.
dream a little dream of me.

say nighty night and kiss me.
just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me.
while i'm alone and blue as can be.
dream a little dream of me.

stars fading but i linger on dear.
still craving your kiss.
i'm longing to linger til dawn dear.
just saying this.

sweet dreams til sunbeams find you.
sweet dreams that leave our worries behind you.
but in your dreams whatever they be.
dream a little dream of me.

sweet dreams til sunbeams find you.
sweet dreams that leave our worries behind.
but in your dreams whatever they be.
dream a little dream of me
