blue skies.
writer(s): irving berlin.


blue skies, smilin' at me.
nothin' but blues skies do i see.

bluebirds singing a song.
nothin' but bluebirds all day long.

never saw the sun shinin' so bright.
never saw things goin' so right.
noticin' the days hurrying by.
when you're in love, my how they fly.

blue days, all of them gone.
nothin' but blue skies from now on
