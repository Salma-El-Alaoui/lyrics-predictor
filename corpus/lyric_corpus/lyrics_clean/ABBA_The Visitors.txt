i hear the doorbell ring and suddenly the panic takes me.
the sound so ominously tearing through the silence.
i cannot move, i'm standing.
numb and frozen.
among the things i love so dearly.
the books, the paintings and the furniture.
help me.

the signal's sounding once again and someone tries the door-knob.
none of my friends would be so stupidly impatient.
and they don't dare to come here.
anymore now.
but how i loved our secret meetings.
we talked and talked in quiet voices.
smiling.

now i hear them moving.
muffled noises coming through the door.
i feel i'm.
crackin' up.
voices growing louder, irritation building.
and i'm close to fainting.
crackin' up.
they must know by now i'm in here trembling.
in a terror evergrowing.
crackin' up.
my whole world is falling, going crazy.
there is no escaping now, i'm.
crackin' up.

these walls have witnessed all the anguish of humiliation.
and seen the hope of freedom glow in shining faces.
and now they've come to take me.
come to break me.
and yet it isn't unexpected.
i have been waiting for these visitors.
help me.

now i hear them moving.
muffled noises coming through the door.
i feel i'm.
crackin' up.
voices growing louder, irritation building.
and i'm close to fainting.
crackin' up.
they must know by now i'm in here trembling.
in a terror evergrowing.
crackin' up.
my whole world is falling, going crazy.
there is no escaping now, i'm.
