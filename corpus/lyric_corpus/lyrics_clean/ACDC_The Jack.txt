she gave me the queen.
she gave me the king.
she was wheelin' and dealin'.
just doin' her thing.
she was holdin' a pair.
but i had to try.
her deuce was wild.
but my ace was high.
but how was i to know.
that she'd been dealt with before.
said she'd never had a full house.
but i should have known.
from the tattoo on her left leg.
and the garter on her right.
she'd have the card to bring me down.
if she played it right.

poker face was her name.
poker face was her nature.
poker straight was her game.
if she knew she could get you.
she play'd 'em fast.
and she play'd 'em hard.
she could close her eyes.
and feel every card.
but how was i to know.
that she'd been shuffled before.
said she'd never had a royal flush.
but i should have known.
that all the cards were comin'.
from the bottom of the pack.
and if i'd known what she was dealin' out.
i'd have dealt it back.
