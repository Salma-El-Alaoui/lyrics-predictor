i work all night i work all day to pay the bills i have to pay.
ain't it sad.
and still there never seems to be a single penny left for me.
that's too bad.
in my dreams.
i have a plan.
if i got me a wealthy man.
i wouldn't have to work at all i'd fool around and have a ball.

(chorus).
money money money.
must be funny.
in the rich man's world.
money money money.
always sunny.
in the rich man's world.
ahaaa.
all the things i could do.
if i had a little money.
it's a rich man's world.

it's a rich man's world.

a man like that is hard to find but i can't get him off my mind.
ain't it sad.
and if he happens to be free i bet he wouldn't fancy me.
that's too bad.
so i must leave.
i'll have to go.
to las vegas or monaco.
and win a fortune in a game my life would never be the same.

(chorus x2).

it's a rich man's world
