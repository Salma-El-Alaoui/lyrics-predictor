verse:.
zephyr in the sky at night i wonder.
do my tears of mourning sink beneath the sun.
she's got herself a universe gone quickly.
for the call of thunder threatens everyone.

chorus:.

and i feel like i just got home.
and i feel.
and i feel like i just got home.
and i feel.

faster than the speeding light she's flying.
trying to remember where it all began.
she's got herself a little piece of heaven.
waiting for the time when earth shall be as one.

(chorus).

quicker than a ray of light.
quicker than a ray of light.
quicker than a ray of light.

(verse).

and i feel.
quicker than a ray of light.
then gone for.
someone else shall be there.
through the endless years.

she's got herself a universe.
she's got herself a universe.
she's got herself a universe.

and i feel.
and i feel.
and i feel like i just got home.
and i feel.

quicker than a ray of light she's flying.
quicker than a ray of light i'm flying
