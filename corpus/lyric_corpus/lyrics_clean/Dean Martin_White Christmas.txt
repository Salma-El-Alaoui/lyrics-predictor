(christmas white christmas).
i'm dreaming of a white christmas.
just like the ones i used to know.
where the treetops glisten.
and children listen.
to hear sleigh bells in the snow.

i am dreaming of a white christmas.
with every christmas card i write.
may your days be merry and bright.
and may all your christmases be white.
