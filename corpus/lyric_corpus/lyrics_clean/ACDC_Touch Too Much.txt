it was one of those nights when you turn out the lights.
and everything comes into view.
she was taking her time, i was loosing my mind.
there was nothing that she wouldn't do.

it wasn't the first, wasn't the last.
she knew we was making love.
i was so satisfied deep down inside.
like a hand in a velvet glove.

seems like a touch, a touch too much.
seems like a touch, a touch too much.
too much for my body, too much for my brain.
this damn woman's gonna drive me insane.
she's got a touch, a touch too much.

she had the face of an angel, smiling with sin.
the body of venus with arms.
dealin' with danger, strokin' my skin.
like a thunder and lightening storm.

it wasn't the first, wasn't the last.
it wasn't that she didn't care.
she wanted it hard, wanted it fast.
she liked it done medium rare.

seems like a touch, a touch too much.
seems like a touch, a touch too much.
too much for my body, too much for my brain.
this damn woman's gonna drive me insane.
she has a touch, a touch too much.

'cause you're much too much too much too much.

seems like a touch.

seems like a touch.
a touch too much.
