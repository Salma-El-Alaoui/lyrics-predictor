super trouper beams are gonna blind me.
but i won't feel blue.
like i always do.
'cause somewhere in the crowd theres you.

i was sick and tired of everything.
when i called you last night from glasgow.
all i do is eat and sleep and sing.
wishing every show was the last show.

so imagine i was glad to hear youre coming.
suddenly i feel all right.
(and suddenly its gonna be).
and it's gonna be so different.
when i'm on the stage tonight.

tonight the super trouper lights are gonna find me.
shining like the sun.
smiling, having fun.
feeling like a number one.

tonight the super trouper beams are gonna blind me.
but i wont feel blue.
like i always do.
'cause somewhere in the crowd there's you.

facing twenty thousand of your friends.
how can anyone be so lonely.
part of a success that never ends.
still i'm thinking about you only.

there are moments when i think i'm going crazy.
but it's gonna be alright.
(you'll soon be changing everything).
everything will be so different.
when i'm on the stage tonight.

tonight the super trouper lights are gonna find me.
shining like the sun.
smiling, having fun.
feeling like a number one.

tonight the super trouper beams are gonna blind me.
but i won't feel blue.
like i always do.
'cause somewhere in the crowd there's you.

so i'll be there when you arrive.
the sight of you will prove to me im still alive.
and when you take me in your arms.
and hold me tight.
i know it's gonna mean so much tonight.

tonight the super trouper lights are gonna find me.
shining like the sun.
smiling, having fun.
feeling like a number one.

tonight the super trouper beams are gonna blind me.
but i won't feel blue.
like i always do.
'cause somewhere in the crowd there's you
