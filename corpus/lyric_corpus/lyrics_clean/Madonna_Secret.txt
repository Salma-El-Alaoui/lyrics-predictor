things haven't been the same.
since you came into my life.
you found a way to touch my soul.
and i'm never, ever, ever gonna let it go.

bridge:.

happiness lies in your own hand.
it took me much too long to understand.
how it could be.
until you shared your secret with me.

chorus:.

mmm mmm (skip for the first two times).
something's comin' over, mmm mmm.
something's comin' over, mmm mmm.
something's comin' over me.
my baby's got a secret.

you gave me back the paradise.
that i thought i lost for good.
you helped me find the reasons why.
it took me by surprise that you understood.
you knew all along.
what i never wanted to say.
until i learned to love myself.
i was never ever lovin' anybody else.

(bridge).
(chorus, repeat).
(bridge).
(chorus, repeat).

mmm mmm, my baby's got a secret.
mmm mmm, my baby's got a secret.
mmm mmm, my baby's got a secret for me.

mmm mmm, mmm mmm, mmm mmm
