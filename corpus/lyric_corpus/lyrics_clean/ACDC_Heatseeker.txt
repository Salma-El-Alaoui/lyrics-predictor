gettin' ready to rock, gettin' ready to roll.
gonna turn up the heat, gonna fire up the coal.
i gotta that motor turnin'.
i gotta keep that engine clean.
i gotta keep those tyres burnin'.
i've got the best you've ever seen.

cos i'm a heatseeker, chargin' up the sky.
heatseeker, and i, don't need no life preserver.
don't need no one to hose me down.
to hose me down.

getting ready to break, get ready to go.
get your shoes off an' shake, get your head down and blow.
ya gotta keep that woman firin'.
you gotta keep that circuit clean.
you gotta make her sound the siren.
you gotta hear that lady scream.

cos i'm a heatseeker, burnin' up the town.
heatseeker, i don't, i don't need no life preserver.
don't need no one to hose me down.
to hose me down, here it comes.

heatseeker.
wanna see you get up, see the whites of your eyes.
i'm a heatseeker.
i'm gonna measure you, gonna try you for size.
i'm a heatseeker.

ya gotta keep that motor turnin'.
ya gotta keep that engine clean.
ya gotta keep those tyres burnin'.
i got the best you've ever seen.
i'm a heatseeker.
i don't need no life preserver.
don't need no one to hose me down.

i'm a heatseeker, i'm a heatseeker, heatseeker.

out on the street feel the heat
