you must be my lucky star.
'cause you shine on me wherever you are.
i just think of you and i start to glow.
and i need your light.
and baby you know.

chorus:.

starlight, starbright first star i see tonight.
starlight, [starbright] make everything all right.
starlight, starbright first star i see tonight.
starlight, [starbright] yeah.

you must be my lucky star.
'cause you make the darkness seem so far.
and when i'm lost you'll be my guide.
i just turn around and you're by my side.

(chorus).

come on shine your heavenly body tonight.
'cause i know you're gonna make everything all right.

you may be my lucky star.
but i'm the luckiest by far.

(chorus).

come on shine your heavenly body tonight.
'cause u know your gonna make everything all right.
(2x).

your may be my lucky star.
but im the luckiest by far
