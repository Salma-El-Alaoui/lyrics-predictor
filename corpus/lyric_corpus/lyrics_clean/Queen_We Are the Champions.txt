i've paid my dues.
time after time.
i've done my sentence.
but committed no crime.

and bad mistakes.
i've made a few.
i've had my share of sand kicked in my face.
but i've come through.
and we mean to go on and on and on.

we are the champions - my friends.
and we'll keep on fighting - till the end.
we are the champions.
we are the champions.
no time for losers.
'cause we are the champions - of the world.

i've taken my bows.
and my curtain calls.
you brought me fame and fortune and everything that goes with it.
i thank you all.

but it's been no bed of roses.
no pleasure cruise.
i consider it a challenge before the whole human race.
and i ain't gonna lose.
and i need to go on and on and on.

we are the champions - my friends.
and we'll keep on fighting - till the end.
we are the champions.
we are the champions.
no time for losers.
'cause we are the champions - of the world.

we are the champions - my friends.
and we'll keep on fighting - till the end.
we are the champions.
we are the champions.
no time for losers.
'cause we are the champions
