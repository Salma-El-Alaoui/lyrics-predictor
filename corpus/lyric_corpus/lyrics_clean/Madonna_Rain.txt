i feel it.
it's coming.

rain... feel it on my finger tips.
hear it on my window pane.
your love's coming down like rain...
wash away my sorrow.
take away my pain.
your love's coming down like rain...

when your lips are burning mine.
and you take the time.
to tell me how you feel.
when you listen to my words.
and i know you've heard.
i know it's real.
rain is what this thunder brings.
for the first time, i can hear my heart sing.
call me a fool but i know i'm not.
i'm gonna stand out here on the mountain top.
till i feel your.

rain... feel it on my finger tips.
hear it on my window pane.
your love's coming down like rain...
wash away my sorrow, take away my pain.
your love's coming down like rain...

when you looked into my eyes.
and you said goodbye.
could you see my tears...
when i turned the other way.
did you hear me say.
i'd wait for all the dark clouds bursting in a perfect sky.
you promised me when you said goodbye.
that you'd return when the storm was done.
and now i wait for the light,.
i'll wait for the sun, till i feel your.

rain... feel it on my finger tips.
hear it on the window pane.
your love's coming down like rain...
wash away my sorrow, take away my pain.
your love's coming down like.

here comes the sun.
here comes the sun.
and i say... never go away...

waiting is the hardest thing [it's strange].
i tell myself that if i believe in you [i feel like i've known you before].
in the dream of you [i want to understand you more].
with all my heart and all my soul [and more and more].
that by sheer force of will [when i'm with you].
i will raise you from the ground [i feel like a magical child].
and without a sound you'll appear [everything strange].
and surrender to me [everything wild].
to love.

rain is what the thunder brings.
for the first time, i can hear my heart sing.
call me a fool but i know i'm not.
i'm gonna stand out here on the mountain top.
till i feel your.

rain...
i feel it, it's coming.
your love's coming down like rain...
i feel it, it's coming.
your love's coming down like rain...
feel it on my finger tips.
hear it on the window pane.
your love's coming down like rain...
wash away my sorrow, take away my pain.
your love's coming down like rain...

i feel it, it's coming.
your love's coming down like rain...
i feel it, it's coming.
your love's coming down like rain...

you step out on the mountaintop.
and you're free to call my name.
rain...
