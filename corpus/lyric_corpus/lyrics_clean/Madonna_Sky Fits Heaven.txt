sky fits heaven so fly it.
that's what the prophet said to me.
child fits mother so hold your baby tight.
that's what my future could see.

fate fits karma so use it.
that's what the wise man said to me.
love fits virtue so hold on to the light.
that's what our future will be.

chorus:.

traveling down this road.
watching the signs as i go.
i think i'll follow the sun.
isn't everyone just.
traveling down their own road.
watching the signs as they go.
i think i'll follow my heart.
it's a very good place to start.

traveling down my own road.
watching the signs as i go.
traveling down my own road.
and i'm watching the signs as they go.

traveling, traveling.
watching the signs as i go.

hand fits giving so do it.
that's what the gospel said to me.
life fits living so let your judgments go.
that's how our future should be.

(chorus).

traveling down my own road.
watching the signs as they go.
traveling down my own road.
and i'm watching the signs as i go.

traveling, traveling.
watching the signs as i go
