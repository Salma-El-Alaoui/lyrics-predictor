she keeps her moet et chandon.
in her pretty cabinet.
'let them eat cake' she says.
just like marie antoinette.

a built-in remedy.
for kruschev and kennedy.
at anytime an invitation.
you can't decline.

caviar and cigarettes.
well versed in etiquette.
extraordinarily nice.

she's a killer queen.
gunpowder, gelatine.
dynamite with a laserbeam.
guaranteed to blow your mind.
anytime.

ooh, recommended at the price.
insatiable an appetite.
wanna try?.

to avoid complications.
she never kept the same address.
in conversation.
she spoke just like a baroness.

met a man from china.
went down to geisha minah.
then again incidentally.
if you're that way inclined.

perfume came naturally from paris.
for cars she couldn't care less.
fastidious and precise.

she's a killer queen.
gunpowder, gelatine.
dynamite with a laserbeam.
guaranteed to blow your mind.
anytime.

drop of a hat she's as willing as.
playful as a pussy cat.
then momentarily out of action.
temporarily out of gas.
to absolutely drive you wild, wild...
she's all out to get you.

she's a killer queen.
gunpowder, gelatine.
dynamite with a laserbeam.
guaranteed to blow your mind.
anytime.

ooh, recommended at the price.
insatiable an appetite.
wanna try?.
you wanna try...
