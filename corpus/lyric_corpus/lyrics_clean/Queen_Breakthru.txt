when love breaks up.
when the dawn light wakes up.
a new life is born - oooooh.
somehow i have to make this final breakthru . . . now!.

ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
i wake up.
feel just fine.
your face.
fills my mind.
i get religion quick.
'cos you're looking divine.
honey you're touching something, you're touchin' me.
i'm under your thumb, under your spell, can't you see ?.
if i could only reach you.
if i could make you smile.
if i could only reach you.
that would really be a breakthru - oh yeah.

breakthru, these barriers of pain.
breakthru, yeah, to the sunshine from the rain.
make my feelings known towards you.
turn my heart inside and out for you now.
somehow i have to make this final breakthru.
now! (now now now).
oh yeah.

ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
your smile.
speaks books to me.
i break up.
with each and every one of your looks at me.
honey you're starting something deep inside of me.
honey you're sparking something, this fire in me.
i'm outta control, i wanna rush headlong into this ecstasy.

if i could only reach you.
if i could make you smile.
if i could only reach you - ooh ooh ooh ooh.
that would really be a breakthru.
if i could only reach you.
if i could make you smile.
if i could only reach you.
that would really be a breakthru.
oh yeah.
breakthru, breakthru.

break, hey.
if i could only reach you.
if i could make you smile.
if i could only reach you - ooh ooh ooh ooh.
that would really be a breakthru.
if i could only reach you.
if i could make you smile.
if i could only reach you.
that would really be a breakthru.
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
