there are many many crazy things.
that will keep me loving you.
and with your permission.
may i list a few.

the way you wear your hat.
the way you sip your tea.
the memory of all that.
no, no, they can't take that away from me.

the way your smile just beams.
the way you sing off key.
the way you haunt my dreams.
no, no, they can't take that away from me.

we may never never meet again, on the bumpy road to love.
but i'll always, always keep the memory of.

the way you hold your knife.
the way we danced till three.
the way you've changed my life.
no they can't take that away from me.
no they can't take that away from me.

(interlude).

we may never, never, never meet again, on the bumpy road to love.
still i'll always, always keep that memory of.

the way you hold your knife.
the way we danced till three.
the way you've changed my life.
no, no, they can't take that away from me.
no they can't take that away.
they won't take that away.
cause they can't take that away.
from me
