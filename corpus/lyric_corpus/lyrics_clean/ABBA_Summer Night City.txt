summer night city...
summer night city...

waiting for the sunrise.
soul dancing in the dark.
summer night city.

walking in the moonlight.
love-making in the park.
summer night city.

in the sun i feel like sleeping.
i can't take it for too long.
my impatience slowly creeping.
up my spine and growing strong.

i know what's waiting there for me.
tonight i'm loose and fancy-free.

when the night comes with the action.
i just know it's time to go.
can't resist the strange attraction.
from that giant dynamo.
lots to take and lots to give.
time to breathe and time to live.

waiting for the sunrise.
soul dancing in the dark.
summer night city.

walking in the moonlight.
love-making in the park.
summer night city.

it's elusive call it glitter.
somehow something turns me on.
some folks only see the litter.
we don't miss them when they're gone.

i love the feeling in the air.
my kind of people everywhere.

when the night comes with the action.
i just know it's time to go.
can't resist the strange attraction.
from that giant dynamo.

and tomorrow, when it's dawning.
and the first birds start to sing.
in the pale light of the morning.
nothing's worth remembering.

it's a dream, it's out of reach.
scattered driftwood on the beach.

waiting for the sunrise.
soul dancing in the dark.
summer night city.

walking in the moonlight.
love-making in the park.
summer night city (repeat 2x and fade)
