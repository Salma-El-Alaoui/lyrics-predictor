i've got you under my skin.
i've got you deep in the heart of me.
so deep in my heart so that you're really a part of me.
i've got you under my skin.

i tried so not to give in.
i said to myself this affair, it never will go so well.
but why should i try to resist when baby, i know so well.
that i've got you under my skin.

chorus.
i`d sacrifice anything come what might.
for the sake of having you near,.
in spite of a warning voice that comes in the night.
it repeats, repeats in my ear.
don't you know little fool, you never can win.
use your mentality, wake up to reality.
but each time i do, just the thought of you.
makes me stop before i begin,.
'cause i've got you under my skin.

big-band instrumental break.

chorus.
i would sacrifice anything come what might.
for the sake of having you near,.
in spite of a warning voice that comes in the night.
it repeats, how it yells in my ear.
don't you know little fool, you never can win.
why not use your mentality, step up, wake up to reality.
but each time i do, just the thought of you.
makes me stop just before i begin,.
'cause i've got you under my skin.
yes, i've got you under my skin
