now, this could only happen to a guy like me.
and only happen in a town like this.
so may i say to each of you, most gratefully.
as i throw each one of you a kiss.

this is my kind of town.
chicago is my kind of town.
chicago is my kind of people too.
people who smile at you and.

each time i roam.
chicago is calling me home.
chicago is why i just grin like a clown.
it's my kind of town.

my kind of town,.
chicago is my kind of town,.
chicago is my kind of raz-ma-taz.
and it has all that jazz and.

each time i leave,.
chicago is tuggin' my sleeve.
chicago is a wrigley building.
chicago is the union stockyard.
chicago is one town that won't let you down.
it's my kind of town
