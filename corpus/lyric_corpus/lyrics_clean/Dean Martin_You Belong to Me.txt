watch the sunrise on a tropic isle.
see the pyramids along the nile.
just remember darlin', all the while.
you belong to me.

see the market place in old algiers.
send me photographs and souvenirs.
just remember when a dream appears.
you belong to me.

i'll be so alone without you.
maybe you'll be lonesome too and blue.

fly the ocean in a silver plane.
see the jungle when it's wet with rain.
just remember til you're home again.
you belong to me.
