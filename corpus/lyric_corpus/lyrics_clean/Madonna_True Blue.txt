hey.

what.

listen.

i've had other guys.
i've looked into their eyes.
but i never knew love before.
'til you walked through my door.
i've had other lips.
i've sailed a thousand ships.
but no matter where i go.
you're the one for me baby this i know, 'cause it's.

chorus:.

true love.
you're the one i'm dreaming of.
your heart fits me like a glove.
and i'm gonna be true blue baby i love you.

i've heard all the lines.
i've cried oh so many times.
those tear drops they won't fall again.
i'm so excited 'cause you're my best friend.
so if you should ever doubt.
wonder what love is all about.
just think back and remember dear.
those words whispered in your ear, i said.

(chorus twice).

intermediate:.

no more sadness, i kiss it good-bye.
the sun is bursting right out of the sky.
i searched the whole world for someone like you.
don't you know, don't you know that it's.

true love, oh baby, true love, oh baby.
true love, oh baby, true love it's.
(repeat).

true, so if you should ever doubt.
wonder what love is all about.
just think back and remember dear.
those words whispered in your ear, i said.

(intermediate).
(chorus).

'cause it's.

true love, oh baby, true love, oh baby.
true love, oh baby, true love it's.
(repeat)
