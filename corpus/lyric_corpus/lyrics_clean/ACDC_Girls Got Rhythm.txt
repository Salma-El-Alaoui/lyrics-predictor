i've been around the world.
i've seen a million girls.
ain't one of them got.
what my lady she's got.
she steals the spotlight.
knocks me off my feet.
she's enough to start a landslide.
just a walkin down the street.
wearing dresses so tight.
and looking dynamite.
enough to blow me out.
no doubt about it can't live without it.

(chorus).
the girl's got rhythm (girl's got rhythm).
the girl's got rhythm (girl's got rhythm).
she's got the backseat rhythm (backseat rhythm).
the girl's got rhythm.

she's like a lethal brand.
too much for any man.
she gives me first degree.
she really satisfies me.
love me till i'm legless.
aching and sore.
enough to stop a freight train.
or start the third world war.
you know i'm losin sleep.
i'm in too deep.
like a body needs blood.
no doubt about it can't live without it.

(chorus).

you know she moves like sin.
and when she lets me in.
it's like liquid love.
no doubt about it can't live without it.

the girl's got rhythm (girl's got rhythm).
the girl's got rhythm (girl's got rhythm).
she's got the backseat rhythm (backseat rhythm).
the girl's got rhythm (girl's got rhythm).
you know she really got the rhythm (girl's got rhythm).
she's got the backseat rhythm (backseat rhythm).
rock n roll rhythm (rock n roll rhythm).
the girl's got rhythm
