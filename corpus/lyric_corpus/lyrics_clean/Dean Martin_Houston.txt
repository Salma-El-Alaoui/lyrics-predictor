houston.

well it�s lonesome in this old town.
everybody puts me down.
i�m a face without a name.
just walking in the rain.
going back to houston, houston, houston.
i�ve got holes in both of my shoes.
well i�m a walking case of the blues.
saw a dollar yesterday.
but the wind blew it away.
going back to houston, houston, houston.
i haven�t eaten in about a week.
i�m so hungry when i walk i squeak.
nobody calls me friend.
it�s sad the shape i�m in.
going back to houston, houston, houston.
i got a girl waiting out for me.
well at least she said she�d be.
i got a home and a big warm bed.
and a feather pillow for my head.
going back to houston, houston, houston
