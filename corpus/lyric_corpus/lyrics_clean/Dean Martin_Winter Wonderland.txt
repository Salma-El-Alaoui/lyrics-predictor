(wonderland winter wonderland wonderland).
sleigh bells ring are you listening.
in the lane snow is glistening.
a beautiful sight oh we're happy tonight.
walking in a winter wonderland.

gone away is the bluebird.
here to stay is a new bird.
he's singing a song as we go along.
walking in a winter wonderland.

well in the meadow we can build a snowman.
and pretend that he is parson brown.
he'll say are you married we say no man.
but you can do the job when you're in town.

later on we'll conspire as we dream by the fire.
to face unafraid of the plans that we made.
walking in a winter wonderland.

(in the meadow we can build a snowman).
and pretend he's a circus clown.
we have lots of fun with mr. snowman.
until the other kiddies knock him down.

oh when it snows ain't it filling.
though your nose gets a chilling.
we'll frolic and play the eskimo way.
walking in a winter wonderland.
