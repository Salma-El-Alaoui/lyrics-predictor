[benny andersson/bj√∂rn ulvaeus].

take it easy with me, please.
touch me gently like a summer evening breeze.
take your time, make it slow.
andante, andante.
just let the feeling grow.

make your fingers soft and light.
let your body be the velvet of the night.
touch my soul, you know how.
andante, andante.
go slowly with me now.

i'm your music.
(i am your music and i am your song).
i'm your song.
(i am your music and i am your song).
play me time and time again and make me strong.
(play me again 'cause you're making me strong).
make me sing, make me sound.
(you make me sing and you make me...).
andante, andante.
tread lightly on my ground.
andante, andante.
oh please don't let me down.

there's a shimmer in your eyes.
like the feeling of a thousand butterflies.
please don't talk, go on, play.
andante, andante.
and let me float away.

i'm your music.
(i am your music and i am your song).
i'm your song.
(i am your music and i am your song).
play me time and time again and make me strong.
(play me again 'cause you're making me strong).
make me sing, make me sound.
(you make me sing and you make me...).
andante, andante.
tread lightly on my ground.
andante, andante.
oh please don't let me down.

make me sing, make me sound.
(you make me sing and you make me...).
andante, andante.
tread lightly on my ground.
andante, andante.
oh please don't let me down.
andante, andante.
oh please don't let me down...
