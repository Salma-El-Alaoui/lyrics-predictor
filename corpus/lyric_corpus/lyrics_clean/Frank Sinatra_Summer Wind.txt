the summer wind, came blowin' in - from across the sea.
it lingered there, to touch your hair - and walk with me.
all summer long, we sang a song - and then we strolled that golden sand.
two sweethearts, and the summer wind.

like painted kites, those days and nights - they went flyin' by.
the world was new, beneath a blue - umbrella sky.
then softer than, a piper man - one day it called to you.
i lost you, i lost you to the summer wind.

the autumn wind, and the winter winds - they have come and gone.
and still the days, those lonely days - they go on and on.
and guess who sighs his lullabies - through nights that never end.
my fickle friend, the summer wind
