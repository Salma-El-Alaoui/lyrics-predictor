diamonds and dust.
poor man last, rich man first.
lambourginis, caviar.
dry martinis, shangri-la.
i got a burning feeling.
deep inside of me.
it's yearning.
but i'm going to set it free.

chorus:.
i'm going in to sin city.
i'm gonna win in sin city.
where the lights are bright.
do the town tonight.
i'm gonna win in sin city.

(i'm gonna rule you baby).

ladders and snakes.
ladders give, snakes take.
rich man, poor man, beggarman, thief.
ain't got a hope in hell, that's my belief.

fingers freddy, diamond jim.
they're getting ready, look out i'm coming in.
so spin that wheel, cut that pack.
and roll those loaded dice.
bring on the dancing girls.
and put the champaign on ice.

chorus
