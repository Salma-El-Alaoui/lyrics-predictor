(spoken:).
watch out!.

i see you on the street and you walk on by.
you make me wanna hang my head down and cry.
if you gave me half a chance you'd see.
my desire burning inside of me.
but you choose to look the other way.
i've had to work much harder than this.
for something i want don't try to resist me.

chorus:.

open your heart to me, baby.
i hold the lock and you hold the key.
open your heart to me, darlin'.
i'll give you love if you, you turn the key.

i think that you're afraid to look in my eyes.
you look a little sad boy, i wonder why.
i follow you around but you can't see.
you're too wrapped up in yourself to notice.
so you choose to look the other way.
well, i've got something to say.
don't try to run i can keep up with you.
nothing can stop me from trying, you've got to.

(chorus).

open your heart with the key.
one is such a lonely number.

ah, ah, ah, ah.
open your heart, i'll make you love me.
it's not that hard, if you just turn the key.

don't try to run i can keep up with you.
nothing can stop me from trying, you've got to.

(chorus).

open your heart with the key.

open your heart, i'll make you love me.
it's not that hard, if you just turn the key.
(repeat and fade)
