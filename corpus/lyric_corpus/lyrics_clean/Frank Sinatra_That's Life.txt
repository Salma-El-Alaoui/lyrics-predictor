that's life, that's what all the people say.
you're riding high in april,.
shot down in may.

i said that's life, and as funny as it may seem.
some people get their kicks,.
stompin' on a dream.
but i don't let it, let it get me down,.

a poet, a pawn and a king.
i've been up and down and over and out.
and i know one thing:.
each time i find myself, flat on my face,.
i pick myself up and get back in the race.

that's life.
i tell ya, i can't deny it,.
i thought of quitting baby,.
but my heart just ain't gonna buy it.
and if i didn't think it was worth one single try,.
i'd jump right on a big bird and then i'd fly.

that's life.
that's life and i can't deny it.

but my heart won't buy it.
but if there's nothing shakin' come this here july.
i'm gonna roll myself up in a big ball and die.
my, my
