so tired of broken hearts and losing at this game.
before i start this dance.
i'll take a chance in telling you.
i want more than just romance.
you are my destiny.
i can't let go -- baby, can't you see?.
cupid please take your aim at me.

cherish the thought.
of always having you here by my side.
(oh baby i) cherish the joy.
you keep bringing it into my life (i'm always singing it).
cherish your strength.
you got the power to make me feel good.
(and baby i) perish the thought.
of ever leaving, i never would.

i was never satisfied with casual encounters.
i can't hide my need for two hearts that bleed with burning love.
that's the way it's got to be.
romeo and juliet, they never felt this way i bet.
so don't underestimate my point of view.
