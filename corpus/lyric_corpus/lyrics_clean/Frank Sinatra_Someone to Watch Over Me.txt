there's a somebody.
i'm longing to see.
i hope that she.
turns out to be.
someone to watch over me.

i'm a little lamb.
who's lost in the wood.
i know i could.
could always be good.
to one who'll watch over me.

although i may not be the man.
some girls think of.
as handsome.
but to her heart.
i'll carry the key.

won't you tell her please.
to put on some speed.
follow my lead.
oh, how i need.
someone to watch over me.

won't you tell her please.
to put on some speed.
follow my lead.
oh....how i need.
someone to watch.
over me
