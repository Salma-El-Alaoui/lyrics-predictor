swaying room as the music starts.
strangers making the most of the dark.
two by two their bodies become one.

i see you through the smokey air.
can`t you feel the weight of my stare.
you`re so close,but still a world away.
what i`m dying to say is that.

chorus:.
i`m crazy for you.
touch me once and you know its true.
i never wanted anyone like this.
its all brand new.
you`ll feel it in my kiss.
i`m crazy for you.
crazy for you.

trying hard to control my heart.
i walk over to where you are.
eye to eye we meet no words at all.

slowly now we begin to move.
every breth i`m deeper into you.
soon we too are standing still in time.
if you read my mind.
you see.

chorus(repeat).
crazy for you.
crazy for you.
crazy for you.
crazy for you.

its all brand new.
i`m crazy for you.
and you know its true.
i`m crazy,crazy for you.
its all brand new.
i`m crazy,crazy for you.
and you know its true.
yeah i`m crazy for you.
crazy for you baby.
i`m crazy for you.
crazy for you baby
