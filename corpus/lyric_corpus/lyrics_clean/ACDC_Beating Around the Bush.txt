smilin' face and laughin' eyes.
but ya can't keep on tellin' me all those lies.
how'd you expect me to believe.
honey i ain't that naive.
baby i got my eye on you.
cause you do all the things i want you to.
stop your cryin' and dry your tears.
i ain't that wet behind the ears.

you can throw me lefts, you can throw me rights.
but where was you last night.
beatin' around the bush.

wish i knew what was on your mind.
why you bein' so unkind.
remember those nights we spent alone.
talkin' on the telephone.
thoughts of you goin' through my brain.
you told me that you felt the same.
you said that you loved me too.
but tell me who was there with you.

i was talkin' birds, and you was talkin' bees.
and was he down on his knees.
beatin' around the bush.

you're the meanest woman i've ever known.
sticks and stones won't break my bones.
i know what you're looking for.
you've eaten your cake you want some more.
i'm gonna give you just a one more change.
try to save our romance.
i've done everything i'm gonna do.
the rest is up to you.

and you can chew it up, you can spit it out.
you can let it all hang out.
beatin' around the bush.

and you can chew it up, you can spit it out.
you can let it all hang out.
beatin' around the bush
