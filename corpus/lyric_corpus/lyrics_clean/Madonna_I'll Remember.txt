mmmm, mmmm.
say good-bye to not knowing when.
the truth in my whole life began.
say good-bye to not knowing how to cry.
you taught me that.

[chorus (first time substitute &quot;strength&quot; for &quot;love&quot; and &quot;saved&quot; for &quot;changed&quot;):].

and i'll remember the love that you gave me.
now that i'm standing on my own.
i'll remember the way that you changed me.
i'll remember.

inside i was a child.
that could not mend a broken wing.
outside i looked for a way.
to teach my heart to sing.

[chorus].

i learned to let go of the illusion that we can possess.
i learned to let go, i travel in stillness.
and i'll remember happiness.
i'll remember (i'll remember).
mmmmm... (i'll remember).
mmmmm...

[chorus].
(i'll remember).

no i've never been afraid to cry.
now i finally have a reason why.
i'll remember (i'll remember).
[repeat 3 times, substituting &quot;and&quot; for &quot;now&quot; the second and third times]
