hey drink up all you people.
order anything you see.
and have fun you happy people.
the laugh and the drinks on me.

try to think that love's not around.
still it's uncomfortably near.
my poor old heart ain't gaining any ground.
because my angel eyes ain't here.

angel eyes, that old devil sent.
they glow unbearably bright.
need i say that my love's mispent.
mispent with angel eyes tonight.

so drink up all of you people.
order anything you see.
and have fun you happy people.
the drink and the laughs on me.

pardon me but i got to run.
the fact's uncommonly clear.
i got to find who's now the number one.
and why my angel eyes ain't here.

excuse me while i disappear
