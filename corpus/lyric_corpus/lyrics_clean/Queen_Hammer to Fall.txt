here we stand or here we fall.
history won't care at all.
make the bed, light the light.
lady mercy won't be home tonight.

you don't waste no time at all.
don't hear the bell but you answer the call.
it comes to you as to us all.
we're just waiting.
for the hammer to fall.

oh ev'ry night and every day.
a little piece of you is falling away.
but lift your face the western way.
build your muscles as your body decays.

toe your line and play their game.
let the anaesthetic cover it all.
till one day they call your name.
you know it's time for the hammer to fall.

rich or poor or famous.
for your truth it's all the same (oh no, oh no).
lock your door the rain is pouring.
through your window pane (oh no).
baby now your struggle's all in vain.

for we who grew up tall and proud.
in the shadow of the mushroom cloud.
convinced our voices can't be heard.
we just wanna scream it louder and louder and louder.

what the hell we fighting for?.
just surrender and it won't hurt at all.
just got time to say your prayers.
while you're waiting for the hammer to hammer to fall.

it's gonna fall.
hammer.
you know.
hammer to fall.
while you're waiting for the hammer to fall.

give it to me one more time
