c'mon ...

up in the morning and out to school.
the teacher is teaching the golden rule.
american history and practical maths.
you studyin' hard and you're hopin' to pass.
ooh you're working your fingers right down to the bone.
and the guy behind you won't leave you alone.

ring ring goes the bell.
the cook in the kitchen is ready to sell.
but you're lucky if you can find a seat.
you're fortunate if you got time to eat.
well back in the classroom open your books.
ooh the teacher don't know how mean she looks.

hail hail rock 'n' roll, hail hail rock 'n' roll.
hail hail rock 'n' roll, hail hail rock 'n' roll.
hail hail rock 'n' roll, hail hail rock 'n' roooooll.

as soon as 3 o'clock goes around.
you finally lay your burden down.
throw down your books and outta your seat.
you go down the hallway into the street.
and you're tryin' to forget just where you've been.
you find a juke joint, you go in.

you drop the quarter right into the slot.
you gotta hear something that's really hot, like me.
with the one you love you're makin' romance.
all day long they wanted to dance.
and you're feeling the music from head to toe.
as round and round and round you go.
get over here.

long live rock 'n' roll, long live rock 'n' roll.
long live rock 'n' roll, long live rock 'n' roll.
long live rock 'n' roll, long live rock 'n' roll, hey.

rock, rock, rock 'n' roll, rock, rock, rock 'n' roll.
rock, rock, rock 'n' roll, rock, rock, rock 'n' roll.
rock, rock, rock 'n' roll, rock, rock, rock 'n' roll, c'mon.

rock, rock, rock 'n' roll, rock, rock, rock 'n' roll.
rock, rock, rock 'n' roll, rock, rock, rock 'n' roll.
rock, rock, rock 'n' roll, rock, rock, rock 'n' roll
