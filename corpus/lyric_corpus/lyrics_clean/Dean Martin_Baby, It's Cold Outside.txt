i really can't stay.
(but baby it's cold outside).

i've got to away.
(but baby it's cold outside).

this evening has been.
(been hoping that you'd drop in).

so very nice.
(i'll hold your hands, they're just like ice).

my mother will start worry.
(beautiful whats your hurry).

my father will be pacing the floor.
(listen to the fireplace roar).

so really i'd better scurry.
(beautiful please don't hurry).

but maybe just a half a drink more.
(put some records on while i pour).

the neighbors might think.
(baby it's bad out there).

say what's in this drink.
(no cabs to be had out there).

i wish i knew how.
(your eyes are like starlight now).

to break this spell.
(i'll take your hat, your hair looks swell).

i ought to say "no, no, no sir".
(mind if i move in closer).

at least i'm gonna say that i tried.
(what's the sense in hurtin' my pride).

i really can't stay.
(oh baby don't hold out).

(both): baby it's cold out side.

i simply must go.
(but baby it's cold outside).

the answer is no.
(but baby it's cold outside).

your welcome has been.
(how lucky that you droped in).

so nice and warm.
(look out the window at the snow).

my sister will be suspicious.
(gosh your lips look delcious).

my brother will be there at the door.
(waves upon the tropical shore).

my maiden aunts mind is vicious.
(gosh your lips are delicous).

but maybe just a cigarette more.
(never such a blizzard before).

i've gotta get home.
(but baby you'd freeze out there).

say lend me a coat.
(it's up to your knees out there).

you've really been grand.
(i thrill when you touch my hand).

but don't you see?.
(now can you do this thing to me?).

there's bound to be talk tomorrow.
(think of my lifelong sorrow).

at least there will be plenty implied.
(if you got pneumonia and died).

i really can't stay.
(get over that old out).

(both):baby it's cold.
