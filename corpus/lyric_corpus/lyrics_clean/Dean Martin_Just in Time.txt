just in time, i found you just in time.
before you came my time was running low.
i was lost, the losing dice were tossed.
my bridges all were crossed, no where to go.


now you're here, now i know just where i'm going.
no more doubt or fears i've found my way.
for love came just in time.
you found me just in time.
and changed my lonely life that lucky day.
