Hey!

He said I'm worth it
his one desire
(I know things about him that you wouldn't wanna read about)
He kissed me
his one and only
this beautiful liar
(Tell me how you tolerate the things you just found out about)

We'll never know
why are we the ones who suffer?
have to let go
he won't be the one to cry

[Chorus]:
Let's not kill the karma
let's not start a fight
it's not worth the drama for a beautiful liar
can't we laugh about it
ha ha
it's not worth our time
oh
we can live without him just a beautful liar

I trusted him, but when I followed you
I saw you together
(I didn't know about you then 'till I saw you with him again)
I walked in
on your love scene
slow dancing
(you stole everything how can you say I did you wrong?)

We'll never know
when the pain and heartbreak's over
have to let go
the innocence is gone

[Chorus]

Tell me how to forgive you
when it's me who's ashamed
and I wish I could free you
of the hurt and the pain
but the answer is simple-
he's the one to blame
