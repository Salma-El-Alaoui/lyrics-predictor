She gave you a flower
The one that God gave her
You all up in de kool-aid
But you do not know de flavor
Get into the zone baby
And do yourself a favor
Head down spin around
Get a little refried
If that don't get it you can
Ketch it on the b side

Just push play
Fuckin' A
Just push play
They're gonna bleep it anyway
Just push play
Fuckin' A
Just push play
We're comin' at you anyway

Sweet leaf dreamer you been
Smoking up the ganja
Damned if you do yeah
But don't get any on ya
Kickin' off the cashmere
Putting on the kasbah
It's a kiss, a diss
And trade it for a coo hah

Just push play
Fuckin' A
Just push play
They're gonna bleep it anyway
Just push play
Fuckin' A
Just push play
We're comin' at you anyway

Instead of growin' old
All dapper and neat
I'm gonna grow my hair
Right down to my feet
It's you and me baby
No pimp daddy jack
It's Cadillac wack no Cadillac wack back

Just push play
Fuckin' A
Just push play
They're gonna bleep it anyway
Just push play
Fuckin' A
Just push play
We're comin' at you anyway

Fuckin' A
They're gonna bleep it anyway
Walk this way
We're comin' at you anyway
Just Push play
Fuckin' A
Just push play
They're gonna bleep it anyway
S'il vous plait
Fuckin' A
Just push play
We're comin' at you anyway
