Oh, Oh, Honey got me hooked on you

I like that, mm

Ohhh, ohh

Ohh, Honey you can have me when you want me
You just simply ask me to be there
And you're the only one who makes me come running
'Cause what you got is far beyond compare

And it's just like honey
When your love comes over me
Oh baby I've got a dependency
Always strung out for another taste of your honey

It's like honey when it washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dying, for you cryin' for you, I adore you
One hit of your love addicted me
Now I'm strung out on you darlin' don't you see?
Every night and day, I can hardly wait
For another taste of honey

Honey I can't describe
How good it feels inside
Honey I can't describe
How good it feels inside

I can't be elusive with you honey
'Cause it's blatant that I'm feeling you
And it's too hard for me to leave abruptly
'Cause you're the only thing I wanna do

And it's just like honey
When your love comes over me
Oh baby I've got a dependency
Always strung out for another
Taste of your honey

It's like honey when it washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dying, for you cryin' for you, I adore you
One hit of your love addicted me
Now I'm strung out on you darlin' don't you see?
Every night and day, I can hardly wait
For another taste of honey

Mace and Puffy (Repeat 2x):
Harlem world, we won't stop
And Mariah, you're on fire
Harlem world, we won't stop
So Mariah, take us higher
Harlem world, we won't stop
And Mariah, you're on fire
Harlem world, we won't stop
So Mariah, take us higher

Breakdown

Ohh, every little thing you do
Oh, honey got me hooked on you

It's like honey when it washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dying, for you cryin' for you, I adore you
One hit of your love addicted me
Now I'm strung out on you darlin' don't you see?
Every night and day, I can hardly wait
For another taste of honey
