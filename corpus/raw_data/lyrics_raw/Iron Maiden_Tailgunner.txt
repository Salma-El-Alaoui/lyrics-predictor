Trace your way back 50 years
To the glow of Dresden - blood and tears
In the black above by the cruel searchlight
Men will die and men will fight - yeah!
Who shoot who and who fired first?
Dripping death to wet the bloodthirst
No radar lock on - skin and bone
The bomber boys are going home

Chours:
Climb into the sky never wonder why - Tailgunner
you're a tailgunner
Climb into the sky never wonder why - Tailgunner
you're a tailgunner
Climb into the sky never wonder why - Tailgunner
you're a tailgunner
Climb into the sky never wonder why - Tailgunner
you're a tailgunner

Nail that Fokker kill that son
Gonna blow your guts out with my gun
The weather forecast's good for war
Colonge and Frankfurt? Have some more!
Tail end Charlie in the boiling sky
The Enola Gay was my last try
Now that this Tailguner's gone
No more bombers (just one big bomb)

Chorus:
