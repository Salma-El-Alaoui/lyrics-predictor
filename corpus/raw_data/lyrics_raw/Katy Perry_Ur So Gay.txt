[Verse 1]
I hope you hang yourself with your H&amp;M scarf
While jacking off listening to Mozart
You bitch and moan about LA
Wishing you were in the rain reading Hemingway
You donâ??t eat meat
And drive electrical cars
Youâ??re so indie rock itâ??s almost an art
You need SPF 45 just to stay alive

[CHORUS]
Youâ??re so gay and you donâ??t even like boys
No you donâ??t even like
No you donâ??t even like
No you donâ??t even like boys
Youâ??re so gay and you donâ??t even like boys
No you donâ??t even like
No you donâ??t even like
No you donâ??t even likeâ?¦

[Verse 2]
Youâ??re so sad maybe you should buy a happy meal
Youâ??re so skinny you should really Super Size the deal
Secretly youâ??re so amused
That nobody understands you
Iâ??m so mean cause I cannot get you outta your head
Iâ??m so angry cause youâ??d rather MySpace instead
I canâ??t believe I fell in love with someone that wears more makeup thanâ?¦

[CHORUS]
Youâ??re so gay and you donâ??t even like boys
No you donâ??t even like
No you donâ??t even like
No you donâ??t even like boys
Youâ??re so gay and you donâ??t even like boys
No you donâ??t even like
No you donâ??t even like
No you donâ??t even likeâ?¦

[BRIDGE]
You walk around like youâ??re oh so debonair
You pull â??em down and thereâ??s really nothing there
I wish you would just be real with me

[CHORUS]
Youâ??re so gay and you donâ??t even like boys
No you donâ??t even like
No you donâ??t even like
No you donâ??t even like boys
Youâ??re so gay and you donâ??t even like boys
No you donâ??t even like
No you donâ??t even like
Oh no no no no no no no
Youâ??re so gay and you donâ??t even like boys
No you donâ??t even like
No you donâ??t even like
No you donâ??t even like boys
Youâ??re so gay and you donâ??t even like boys
No you donâ??t even like
No you donâ??t even like
No you donâ??t even likeâ?¦ PENIS
