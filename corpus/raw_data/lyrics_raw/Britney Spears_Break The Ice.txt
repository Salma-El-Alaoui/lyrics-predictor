''It's been a while
I know I shouldn't have kept you waiting
But I'm here now''

I know it's been a while, but I'm glad you came
And I've been thinking 'bout how you say my name
Ya got my body spinning like a hurricane
And it feels like you got me going insane

And I can't get enough, so let me get it up
Ooh, looks like we're alone now
You ain't gotta be scared, we're grown now
I'mma hit defrost on ya
Let's get it blazin'
We can turn the heat up, if you wanna
Turn the lights down low, if you wanna
Just wanna move ya, but you're froze up
That's what I'm sayin'

Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Won't you warm up to me
Baby, I can make you feel
Hot, hot, hot, hot
Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Won't you warm up to me
Baby, I can make you feel
Hot, hot, hot, hot

''So you warming up yet?''

You got me hypnotized, I never felt this way
You got my heart beating like an 808
Can you rise to the occasion
I'm patiently waiting 'cos it's getting late and

And I can't get enough, so let me get it up
Ooh, looks like we're alone now
You ain't gotta be scared, we're grown now
I'mma hit defrost on ya
Let's get it blazin'
We can turn the heat up, if you wanna
Turn the lights down low, if you wanna
Just wanna move ya, but you're froze up
That's what I'm sayin'

Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Won't you warm up to me
Baby, I can make you feel
Hot, hot, hot, hot
Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Won't you warm up to me
Baby, I can make you feel
Hot, hot, hot, hot

''I like this part, hoo
It feels kinda good
Yeah''

Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Won't you warm up to me
Baby, I can make you feel
Hot, hot, hot, hot (oh)
Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Won't you warm up to me
Baby, I can make you feel
Hot, hot, hot, hot

Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Won't you warm up to me
Baby, I can make you feel
Hot, hot, hot, hot
Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Won't you warm up to me
Baby, I can make you feel
Hot, hot, hot, hot
