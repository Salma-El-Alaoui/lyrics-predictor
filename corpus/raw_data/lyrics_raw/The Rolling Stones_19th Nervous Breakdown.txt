You're the kind of person
You meet at certain dismal, dull affairs
Center of a crowd, talkin' much too loud
Runnin' up and down the stairs
Well it seems to me that you have seen too much in too few years
And though you've tried, you just can't hide
Your eyes are edged with tears

You better stop
And look around
Here it comes, here it comes, here it comes, here it comes
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown

When you were a child
You were treated kind
But you were never brought up right
You were always spoiled with a thousand toys
But still you cried all night
Your mother who neglected you
Owes a million dollars tax
And your father's still perfecting ways of making sealing wax

You better stop
And look around
Here it comes, here it comes, here it comes, here it comes
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown

Oh, who's to blame?
That girl's just insane
Well nothing I do don't seem to work
It only seems to make matters worse, oh please

You were still in school
When you had that fool
Who really messed your mind
And after that you turned your back
On treating people kind
On our first trip
I tried so hard to rearrange your mind
But after awhile I realized you were disarranging mine

You better stop
And look around
Here it comes, here it comes, here it comes, here it comes
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown

Oh, who's to blame?
That girl's just insane
Well nothing I do don't seem to work
It only seems to make matters worse, oh please

When you were a child
You were treated kind
But you were never brought up right
You were always spoiled with a thousand toys
But still you cried all night
Your mother who neglected you
Owes a million dollars tax
And your father's still perfecting ways of making sealing wax

You better stop
And look around
Here it comes
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown
