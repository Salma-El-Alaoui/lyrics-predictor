The weekend's almost done
The moon is low in the sky
I feel like goin' out
Before the night passes by
I won't just sit around
When life becomes a drag...
I dance

I like the bass
(Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up)
I like boom
(Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up)
I need guitar
(Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up)
I like that drum...
When it goes
(Bum-da-bum-da-bum)

Let's dance
What the weekend
What the night is all about
Let's dance
Grab your girlfriend's
Grab your boyfrind's
Sweat it out
Let's dance
(Move your whole body)
And let's start the party
Too much rock for one girl can make her go crazy
I need someone to dance with me, baby
(Dance!)

The music's on
(Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up)
My favorite song
(Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up)
The beat is strong
(Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up)
We'll dance

(Come on!)
Let's dance
What the weekend
What the night is all about
Let's dance
Grab your girlfriend's
Grab your boyfriend's
Sweat it out
Let's dance
(Move your whole body)
And let's start the party
Too much rock for one girl can make her go crazy
I need someone to dance with me, baby

When the night says hello
Yeah get ready to go
Turn it up
Turn it loose
Yeah you've got no excuse
Just take a chance
Get out on the floor and dance

Let's dance
What the weekend
What the night is all about
Let's dance
Grab your girlfriend's
Grab your boyfriend's
Sweat it out
Let's dance
(Da-a-ance)
And let's start the party

(Dance with me, dance with me, dance with me, dance)
Repeat chorus
I said "As my album goes number one...before these five months"
Hahaha
