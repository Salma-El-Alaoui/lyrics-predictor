One summer night
We ran away for a while
Laughing, we hurried beneath the sky
To an obscure place to hide
That no-one could find

And we drifted to another state of mind
And imagined I was yours and you were mine
As we lay upon the grass
There in the dark
Underneath the stars
(Young love)
Underneath the stars

Weak in the knees
Wrapped in the warm gentle breeze
So shy, a bundle of butterflies
Flush with heat of desire
On a natural high

As we drifted to another place in time
And the feeling was so heady and sublime
As I lost my heart to you
There in the dark
Underneath the stars
(Young love)

Ooh
(Young love)
Shoop doo doo doo doo

Beautiful and bittersweetly
You were fading into me
And I was gently fading into you (baby baby)
But the time went sailing by (ooh oh yeah oh yeah)
Reluctantly we said goodbye
And left our secret place so far behind
And I lay in bed all night
And I was drifting
Drifting
Drifting
Drifting

And I was yours
And you were my own
My own baby
As we lay
As we
Lay underneath the stars
(Young love)

Ooh ooh whoa oh baby
shoop doo doo doo
shoop doo doo doo
shoop doo doo doo
Ooh ooh whoa oh
Yeah yeah oh
Underneath the stars
I was drifting
Drifting
Drifting
Underneath the stars
(Young love)
(Young love)
And I
Underneath the stars
Baby,baby
