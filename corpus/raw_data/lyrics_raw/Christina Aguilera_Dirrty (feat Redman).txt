Redman:
Ah, dirrty (dirrty)

Nasty (ho), christina you nasty? (yeah)
Too dirrty to clean my act up

Somebody ring the alarm
A fire on the roof
Ring the alarm (and I'm throwin' elbows) x3

Still jumping, six in the morning
Table dancing, glasses are crashin' (oh)
No question, time for some action

Temperature's up (can you feel it)

Get your boys
Gonna make some noise

Wanna get rowdy
Gonna get a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry
Wanna get dirrty
It's about time that I came to start the party
Sweat dripping over my body
Dancing getting just a little naughty
Wanna get dirrty
It's about time for my arrival

Ah, heat is up
So ladies, fellas
Drop your cups
Body's hot
Front to back
Now move your ass (ha)

Tight hip huggers (low for sho)
Shake a little somethin' (on the floor)
I need that, uh, to get me off
Sweat'n til my clothes come off

Let's get open, cause a commotion (ooh oh)
We're still going, eight in the morning
There's no stopping, we keep it popping (oh)

My gear look like the bank got my money froze
For dead presidents I pimp like Huddy roll
Doc the one that excite ya divas (ow!)
If the media shine
I'm shining with both of the sleeves up
Yo Christina, better hop in here
My block live and in color, like Rodman hair (yeah)
The club is packed, the bar is filled
I'm waiting for sister to act, like Lauryn Hill
Frankly, it's a rap, no bargain deals
I drive a four wheel ride with foreign wheels
Throw it up
Baby it's brick city, you heard of that
We blessed, and hung low, like Bernie Mac
Dogs, let 'em out, women, let 'em in
It's like I'm ODB, the way I'm freaking

Wanna get rowdy (rowdy, yeah)
Gonna get a little unruly (ruly)
Get it fired up in a hurry (hurry)
