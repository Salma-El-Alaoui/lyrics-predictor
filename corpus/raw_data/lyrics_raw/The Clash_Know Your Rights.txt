This is a public service announcement
With guitar!

Know your rights, all three of them!

Number 1:
You have the right not to be killed
Murder is a CRIME!
Unless it was done by a
Policeman or aristocrat...
Know your rights!

And Number 2:
You have the right to food money
Providing of course
You don't mind a little
Investigation, humiliation
And if you cross your fingers
Rehabilitation...

Know your rights!
These are your rights!

Number 3:
You have the right to free speech
As long as
You're not dumb enough to actually try it!

Know your rights,
These are your rights!
All three of 'em!

And it has been suggested
In some quarters
That this is not enough!
Well...

Get off the streets
Run!
