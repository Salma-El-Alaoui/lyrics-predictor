Can we touch the soul of heaven?
Can we unite a sacred lesson?
Every child creates a skylight...of beauty
Can you hear cathedrals fallin’
All the universe is callin’
Cry a single cello...from your heart

Since the world has lost her way
Loneliness journey endlessly
Yet the promised chance remains
Gift of what could be

So let the children remember the sun
Let them dance, let them soar
For their lives have begun
Let the children engender the rain
As the river runs through fields
Forever subsiding their pain
Prayer...

Every voice along the shoreline
Standing still within time
Spinnin’ unresolved...the walkin’
As each season passes
Through wonderland, through lookin’ glasses
The secret garden shines...beckons you
Gentle flower don’t fade away
Sweet innocence still harbors thee
In the faith of golden dreams
Where one love lives eternally

Let the children remember the sun
Let them dance, let them soar
For their lives have begun
Let the children engender the rain
As the river runs through fields
Forever subsiding their pain
Prayer...

Prayer...

Ohhhhh...
Bless the children for they are the light
They are the truth of spirit in flight
Yes the children engender the rain
As the river runs through life
Healing their pain
You can trust with your heart one more time
Sweet angel conceived
You have forever and always believed...

Prayer...prayer...

Prayer...
