He was looking, say he wana hook up
But she don't wanna hook up
Told her, just go
And then she looked and said she wanna hook up
I really wanna hook up
Told her, let's go

Baby, I can't believe everything
Your body makes me wanna do
And the way that you move on the floor
Now I think I'm in love with you
Grab my waist
Wanna get with the rhythm and that move you do
Switch my hips on the floor
Take it slow so I can keep up with you

Back it up now
Bump your rump now
Grab my waist now
Work it out now
Grab my shoulder
Pick it up now
Take it lower
To the floor now

Hook up, baby
We can drop a little somethin'
Ride it, baby
We can do a little somethin'
You know, baby
Let's hook up a little somethin'

Baby, I can't believe everything
That I feel when I dance with you
Feel the small of my back to the breath on my neck
To the move you do
Put your body
Gotta get my body up right next to you
Move the party
Gotta rock the party until they're over you

Back it up now
Bump your rump now
Grab my waist now
Work it out now
Grab my shoulder
Pick it up now
Take it lower
To the floor now

Boy, I can't explain
What you do to me
My whole world has changed
I live in a fantasy
Tonight, I'm in the mood
Please take me by your hand
I wanna get in your groove
So, baby, take me there

Don't stop
Just get, get on the floor
Butt drops
Hips pop, poppin' for sure
Who's got, got it
Get it some more
One time, two times, three times we go

Back it up now
Bump your rump now
Grab my waist now
Work it out now
Grab my shoulder
Pick it up now
Take it lower
To the floor now

Back it up now
Bump your rump now
Grab my waist now
Work it out now
Grab my shoulder
Pick it up now
Take it lower
To the floor now

Hook up, baby
We can drop a little somethin'
Ride it, baby
We can do a little somethin'
You know, baby
Let's hook up a little somethin'

Back it up now
Bump your rump now
Grab my waist now
Work it out now
Grab my shoulder
Pick it up now
Take it lower
To the floor now
