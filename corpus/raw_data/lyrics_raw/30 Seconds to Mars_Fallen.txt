Yeah, I've been to Jupiter
And I've fallen through the air
I used to live out on the moon
But now I'm back here down on earth

Why are you here?
Are you listening?
Can you hear what I am saying?
I am not here, I'm not listening
I'm in my head and I'm spinning

Is this who you are?
Some sweet violent urge?
A weak fallen man
With the promise of an end?

All the pretty people died
Innocence is out of style
All the whores have gone away
Now there's nothing left for me

Why are you here?
Are you listening?
Can you hear what I am saying?
I am not here, I'm not listening
I'm in my head and I'm spinning

Is this who you are?
Some sweet violent urge?
A weak fallen man
With the promise of an end?

Is this who you are?
Some sweet violent urge?
A weak fallen man
With the promise of an end?
