Tailored suits, chauffeured cars
Fine hotels and big cigars
Up for grabs, all for a price
Where the red hot girls keep on dancin' through the night

The claim is on you
The sights are on me
So what do you do?
That's guaranteed
Hey little girl, you want it all
The furs, the diamonds, the painting on the wall

Come on, come on, love me for the money
Come on, come on, listen to the money talk
Come on, come on, love me for the money
Come on, come on, listen to the money talk

A French maid, foreign chef
A big house with king size bed
You had enough, you ship 'em out
The dollar's up, down, you better buy the pound

The claim is on you
The sights are on me
So what do you do?
That's guaranteed
Hey little girl, you break the laws
You hustle, you deal, you steal from us all

Come on, come on, love me for the money (Money talks)
Come on, come on, listen to the money talk (Money talks)
Come on, come on, love me for the money (Money talks)
Come, come on, listen to the money talk
Money talks, yeah, yeah

Money talks, B.S. walks
Money talks, come on, come on

Come on, come on, love me for the money (Money talks)
Come on, come on, listen to the money talk (Money talks)
Come on, come on, love me for the money (Money talks)
Come on, come on, listen to the money talk

Come on, come on, love me for the money (Money talks)
Come on, come on, listen to the money talk (Money talks)
Come on, come on, love me for the money (Money talks)
Come on, come on, listen to the money talk
