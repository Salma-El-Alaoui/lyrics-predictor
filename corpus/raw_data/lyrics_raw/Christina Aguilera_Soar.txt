When they push when they pull
Tell me can you hold on
When they say you should change
Can you lift your head high
And stay strong
Will you give up, give in
When your heart's crying out
That it's wrong
Will you love you for you
At the end of it all

In life, there's gonna be times
When you're feeling low
And in your mind insecurity
Seems to take control
We start to look outside ourselves
For acceptance and approval
We keep forgettin' that
The one thing we should know is

Don't be scared to fly alone,
Find a path that is your own
Love will open every door
It's in your hands
The world is yours
Don't hold back and always know
All the answers will unfold
What are you waiting for
Spread your wings and soar

The boy who wonders is he
Good enough for them
Keeps tryin' to please 'em all
But he just never seems to fit in
Then there the girl who thinks
She'll never ever be good enough for him
Keeps tryin' to change
And that's a game she'll never win

Now in life there's gonna be times
When you're feeling low
And in your mind insecurity
Seems to take control
We start to look outside ourselves
For acceptance and approval
We keep forgetting that the one thing
We should know is

Don't be scared to fly alone
Find a path that is your own
Love will open every door
It's in your hands
The world is yours
Don't hold back and always know
All the answers will unfold
What are you waiting for
Spread your wings and soar

In the mirror is where she comes
Face to face with her fears
Her own reflection
Now foreign to her after all these years
All of her life she has tried
To be something besides herself
Now time has passed
And she's ended up with someone
Else with regret

What is it in us
That makes us feel the need
To keep pretending
Gotta let ourselves be

Don't be scared to fly alone
Find a path that is your own
Love will open every door
It's in your hands
The world is yours
Don't hold back and always know
All the answers will unfold
What are you waiting for
Spread your wings and soar

Don't be scared to fly alone
Find a path that is your own
Love will open every door
It's in your hands
The world is yours
Don't hold back and always know
All the answers will unfold
What are you waiting for
Spread your wings and soar

Don't wait no more
You can soar
You can soar
You can soar
You can soar
Soar babe yeah

So whatcha waiting for?
