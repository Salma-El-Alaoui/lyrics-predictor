I leave the gas on
Walk the allies in the dark
Sleep with candles burning
I leave the door unlocked
I'm weaving a rope and
Running all the red lights
Did I get your attention
Cause I'm sending
All the signs and
The clock is ticking
And I'll be giving
My 2 weeks

Pick your favorite
Shade of black
You'd best
Prepare a speech
Say something funny
Say something sweet
But don't say
That you loved me

[Chorus]
Cause I'm still breathing
Though we've been
Ddead for awhile
This sickness has no cure
We're goin down for sure
Already lost a grip
Best abandon ship

Maybe I was too pale
Maybe I was too fat
Maybe you wanted better
Better luck off in the sack
No formal education
And I swore way too much
But I swear
You didn't fucking care
Cause we were in love

So as I write this letter
And she'd my last tear
No, it's all for the better
That we end this this year
Let's close this chapter
Say one last prayer
But don't say
That you loved me

[Chorus]
I'm still breathing
I'm still breathing
