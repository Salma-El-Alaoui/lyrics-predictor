Look at the crowd and tell me whether
All are surrounded
But none are together
If you're awake
Look all around at
All of the people
Still you're so alone
So alone
So alone
So alone
So alone

(Yelling)If I could make a suggestion
Without sounding preachy
Or begging the question
Melt with your minds
Melt with each other
Don't be surrounded
Don't be so alone
So alone
So alone
So alone

(KILL)
(FUCK OFF)
(HATE)
(DIE)
