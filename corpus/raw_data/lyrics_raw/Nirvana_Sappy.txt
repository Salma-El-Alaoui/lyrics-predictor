And if you save yourself
You will make him happy

He'll keep you in a jar
And you'll think you're happy
He'll give you breathing holes
And you'll think you're happy
He'll cover you with grass
And you'll think you're happy
Now

You're in a laundry room (x2)
Conclusion came to you
Ahh

And if you cut yourself
You will think you're happy
He'll keep you in a jar
And you'll make him happy
He'll give you breathing holes
And you'll think you're happy
He'll cover you with grass
And you'll think you're happy
Now

(x2)
You're in a laundry room (x2)
Conclusion came to you
Ahh

And if you fool yourself
You will make him happy
He'll keep you in a jar
And you'll think you're happy
He'll give you breathing holes
Then you will think you're happy
You'll wallow in your shit
Then you'll think you're happy
Now

You're in a laundry room (x3)
Conclusion came to you
Ahh
