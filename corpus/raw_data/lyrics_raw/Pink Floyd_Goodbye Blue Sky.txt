''{spoken} Look mummy, there's an aeroplane up in the sky.''

Did you see the frightened ones?
Did you hear the falling bombs?
Did you ever wonder why we had to run for shelter
When the promise of a brave new world.

The flames are all long gone, but the pain lingers on.

Goodbye, blue sky
Goodbye, blue sky
Goodbye
Goodbye
