Off through the new day's mist I run
Out from the new day's mist I have come
I hunt
therefore I am
harvest the land
taking of the fallen lamb

Off through the new day's mist I run
Out from the new day's mist I have come
we shift
pulsing with the earth
company we keep
roaming the land while you sleep

shape shift nose to the wind
shape shift feeling I've been
move swift all senses clean
earth's gift back to the meaning of life

bright is the moon high in starlight
chill in the air cold as steel tonight
we shift
call of the wild
fear in your eyes
it's later than you realized

shape shift nose to the wind
shape shift feeling I've been
move swift all senses clean
earth's gift back to the meaning of life

(guitar & drum solo)

I feel a change
back to a better day
(shape shift)hair stands on the back of my neck
(shape shift)in wildness is the preservation of the world

so seek the wolf in thyself

shape shift nose to the wind
shape shift feeling I've been
move swift all senses clean
earth's gift back to the meaning...

Of wolf, and man yeah
