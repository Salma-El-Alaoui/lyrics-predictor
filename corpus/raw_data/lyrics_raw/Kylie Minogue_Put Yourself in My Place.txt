I can't take this situation
It's making me feel so blue
One moment you walked into my life
And now you're saying that we're through

I hear that you're in love now
Babe, I don't know what to say
I can't believe that I still feel this way
I hear that you're in love now
Babe, I don't know what to say
Before you decide you won't be mine
Put yourself in my place

The circle will come around
You're gonna put yourself
(Put yourself)
In my place
When your lovers bring you down
And there's no-one else around
You're gonna put yourself
(Put yourself)
In my place

There's no rhyme or reason
That keeps me playing along
I guess that I'll just keep on believing
Inside you love will know right from wrong

I hear that you're in love now
Babe, I don't know what to say
I can't believe that I still feel this way
I hear that you're in love now
Babe, I don't know what to say
Before you decide you won't be mine
Put yourself in my place

The circle will come around
You're gonna put yourself
(Put yourself)
In my place
When your lovers bring you down
And there's no-one else around
You're gonna put yourself
(Put yourself)
In my place

The circle will come around
You're gonna put yourself
(Put yourself)
In my place
When your lovers bring you down
And there's no-one else around
You're gonna put yourself
(Put yourself)
In my place
