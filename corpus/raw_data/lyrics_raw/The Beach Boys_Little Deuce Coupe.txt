Little deuce coupe
You don't know what I got

Well I'm not braggin' babe so don't put me down
But I've got the fastest set of wheels in town
When something comes up to me he don't even try
'Cause if I had a set of wings man I know she could fly
She's my little deuce coupe you don't know what I got

Just a little deuce coupe with a flat head mill
But she'll walk a thunderbird Like she's standin' still
She's ported and relieved and she's stroked and bored
She'll do a hundred and forty with the top end floored
She's my little deuce coupe you don't know what I got

She's got a competition clutch with the four on the floor
And she purrs like a kitten 'till the lake pipes roar
And if that ain't nough to make you flip your lid
There's one more thing I got the pink slip daddy

And coming off the line when the light turns green
Well she blows 'em outta the water like you never seen
I get pushed out of shape and it's hard to steer
When I get rubber in all four gears
She's my little deuce coupe you don't know what I got
She's my little deuce coupe you don't know what I got
