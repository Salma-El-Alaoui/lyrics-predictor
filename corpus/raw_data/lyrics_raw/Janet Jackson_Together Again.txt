There are times when I look above and beyond
There are times when I feel your love around me baby
I'll never forget my baby
I'll never forget you

There are times when I look above and beyond
There are times when I feel your love around me baby
I'll never forget my baby
When I feel that I don't belong
Draw my strength
From the words when you said
Hey it's about you baby
Look deeper inside you baby

(Bridge)
I dream about us together again
When I want us together again baby
I know we'll be together again 'cause

(Chorus)
Everywhere I go
Every smile I see
I know you are there
Smilin' back at me
Dancin' in moonlight
I know you are free
I can see your star
Shinin' down on me

(Together again ooh )
Good times we'll share again
(Together again ooh )
Makes me wanna dance
(Together again ooh)
Say it loud and proud
(Together again ohh)
All my loves for you

Always been a true angel to me
Now above
I can't wait for you to wrap your wings around me baby
Wrap them around me baby
Sometimes hear you whisperin'
No more pain
No worries will you ever see now baby
I'm so happy for my baby

(Bridge)
I dream about us together again
When I want us together again baby
I know we'll be together again 'cause

(Chorus)
Everywhere I go
Every smile I see
I know you are there
Smilin' back at me
Dancin' in moonlight
I know you are free
I can see your star
Shinin' down on me

(Together again ooh )
Good times we'll share again
(Together again ooh )
Makes me wanna dance
(Together again ooh)
Say it loud and proud
(Together again ohh)
All my loves for you

There are times when I look above and beyond
There are times when I feel you smile upon me baby
I'll never forget my baby
What'll I give just to hold you close
As on earth
In heaven we will be together baby
Together again my baby

(Chorus)
Everywhere I go
Every smile I see
I know you are there
Smilin' back at me
Dancin' in moonlight
I know you are free
I can see your star
Shinin' down on me

(Chorus)
Everywhere I go
Every smile I see
I know you are there
Smilin' back at me
Dancin' in moonlight
I know you are free
I can see your star
Shinin' down on me
