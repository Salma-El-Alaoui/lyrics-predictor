Rag doll, livin' in a movie
Hot tramp, daddy's little cutie
You're so fine, they'll never see ya leavin' by the back door, man
Hot time, get it while it's easy
Don't mind, come on up and see me
Rag doll, baby won't you do me
Like you done before

I'm feelin' like a bad boy
Mmm, just like a bad boy
I'm rippin' up a rag doll
Like throwing away an old toy

Some babe's talkin' real loud
Talkin' all about the new crowd
Try and sell me on an old dream
A new version of the old scene

Speak easy on the grapevine
Keep shufflin' in the shoe shine
Old Tin Lizzie, do it till you're dizzy
Give it all ya got until you're put out of your misery

Rag doll, livin' in a movie
Hot tramp, daddy's little cutie
You're so fine, they'll never see ya leavin' by the back door, man
Hot time, get it while it's easy
Don't mind, come on up and see me
Rag doll, baby won't you do me
Like you done before

Yes I'm movin', yes I'm movin'
Get ready for the big time
Tap dancing on a land mine

Yes I'm movin', yes I'm movin'
Old Tin Lizzie, do it till you're dizzy
Give it all ya got until you're put out of your misery

Rag doll, livin' in a movie
Hot tramp, daddy's little cutie
You're so fine, they'll never see ya leavin' by the back door, man
Hot time, get it while it's easy
Don't mind, come on up and see me
Rag doll, baby won't you do me
Baby won't you do me
Baby won't you do me
Like you done before

Yes I'm movin', yes I'm movin'
Get ready for the big time
Get crazy on the moonshine

Yes I'm movin', I'm really movin'
Sloe gin fizzy, do it till you're dizzy
Give it all you got until you're put out of your misery

Rag doll, livin' in a movie
Hot tramp, daddy's little cutie
You're so fine, they'll never see ya leavin' by the back door, man
Hot time, get it while it's easy
Don't mind, come on up and see me
Rag doll, baby won't you do me
Like you done before
