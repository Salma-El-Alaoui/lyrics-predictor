The rain is here and you, my dear, are still my friend
It's true, the two of us are back as one again

CHORUS
I was the one who left you
Always coming back
I cannot forget you, girl
Now I am up in arms again

(REPEAT ALL)

Together now I don't know how this love could end
My lonely heart, it falls apart for you to mend

CHORUS (3X)
