Got a sing song, man it goes like this

Somewhere the time was right, could have been gone in ten
This world is hard to fight, hitting you once, hit it again
To know the way it feels, everyone gets knocked down
When you get up it's real, taking it back, turn it around

Get on it, up on it
Get on it, (wouldn't wanna be you)
Get on it, out on it
Get on it, (no one's gonna free you)
You know, when you're keeping it slow
No matter where you wanna go, (wouldn't wanna be you)
Get on it, up on it
It's on, (we're living in chaos)

Somewhere along the line, things get chipped away
This place keeps going down, gets a little worse every day
I see hate and greed, this world's a messed up town
Embrace the pain and see, taking it back, turn it around

Get on it, up on it
Get on it, (wouldn't wanna be you)
Get on it, out on it
Get on it, (no one's gonna free you)
You know, when you're keeping it slow
No matter where you wanna go, (wouldn't wanna be you)
Get on it, up on it
It's on,

[x4] Falling!
[x4]Ya, Ya, Ya, Ya

Ya, Ya, Ya, Ya
Get on it, up on it (Ya, Ya, Ya, Ya)

Get on it, (no one's gonna free you)
Ya, Ya, Ya, Ya
