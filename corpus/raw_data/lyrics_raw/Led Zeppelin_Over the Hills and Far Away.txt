Hey lady
You got the love I need
Maybe more than enough
Oh, darlin', darlin', darlin'
Walk a while with me
Ohh, you've got so much
So much
So much

Many have I loved
Many times been bitten
Many times I've gazed along the open road

Many times I've lied
And many times I've listened
Many times I've wondered how much there is to know

Many dreams come true
And some have silver linings
I live for my dream and a pocketful of gold

Mellow is the man
Who knows what he's been missing
Many many men can't see the open road

Many is a word that only leaves you guessing
Guessing 'bout a thing you really ought to know, ohh ohh ohh ohh
Really ought to know, ohh ohh
I really ought to know
