Everyone makes one mistake
One more time for old times sake
One more time before the feeling fades
One less born of memories
One more bruise you gave to me
One more test just how much can i take?

You're not the one but you're the only one who could make me feel like this
You're not the one but you're the only one who can make me feel like SHIT

Something never meant to be
Everything you meant to me
Wake me when this punishment is done
Those who try and get away
From the one who gets away
Someone's always someone else's one

You're not the one but your the only one who could make me feel like this
You're not the one but your the only one who can make me feel like SHIT

Until the end of time
In another life
Til the day i die
Save it up for one more try
Save it for the last goodbye
We go ON
and get OFF
and get ON
and get OFF
-Guitar solo-
You're not the one but you're the only one who could make me feel like this
You're not the one but you're the only one who can make me feel like SHIT
