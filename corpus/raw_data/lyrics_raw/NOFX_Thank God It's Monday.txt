I’m gonna tell you what I really think I like about Monday
Cause they feel like Saturdays
When you don’t have to go to work, every day is a holiday
I wake up when I want to, I do anything I wanna do
Can’t wait for Tuesday
I really don’t like Fridays I can’t do what I wanna do
Sold out at the movies, can’t eat at the restaurant
Everybody wants to party, but the bar’s full of cigarette smoke
I think I’ll stay home, I think I’ll wait for Monday

I live a five day weekend, I gotta year long holiday
Thanks god it’s Monday
The only place I gotta be is the show or on the first tee
Thank god it’s Monday
Never mind aggravation, just give me modulation gimmie another key

I’ll tell you why I like Tuesdays, cause they’re kinda like Christmas
Come to think about Wednesdays, are a little like Chanakah
Thursdays thanksgiving, I’m talking about good living
I think I’ll give thanx
Thank god it’s Monday
