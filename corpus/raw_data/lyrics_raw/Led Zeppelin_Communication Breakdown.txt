Hey, girl, stop what you're doin'
Hey, girl, you'll drive me to ruin
I don't know what it is that I like about you, but I like it a lot
Oh, won't you let me hold you, let me feel your lovin' touch

Communication breakdown
It's always the same
Havin' a nervous breakdown
Drive me insane

Hey, babe, I got something I think you ought to know
Hey, babe, I wanna tell you that I love you so
I wanna hold you in my arms, yeah
I'm never gonna let you go, 'cause I like your charms

Communication breakdown
It's always the same
Havin' a nervous breakdown
Drive me insane
Oh suck it!

Communication breakdown
It's always the same
Havin' a nervous breakdown
A-drive me insane, yeah

Communication breakdown (Yeah, I want you to love me all night, I want you to know that)
Communication breakdown (I want, hey, I want, oh)
Communication breakdown (I want you to love me, I want you to love me babe)
Communication breakdown (I want you to love, yeah, I want you to love)
Communication breakdown (Hey, I want you to love yeah)
