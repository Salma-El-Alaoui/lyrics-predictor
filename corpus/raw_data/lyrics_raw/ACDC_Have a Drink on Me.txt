Oh, whiskey, gin and brandy
With a glass I'm pretty handy
I'm trying to walk a straight line
On sour mash and cheap wine
Yeah, so join me for a drink boys
Oh, we're gonna make a big noise
So don't worry about tomorrow
Take it today
Forget about the check
We'll get hell to pay

Have a drink on me
Have a drink on me
Yeah, have a drink on me
Have a drink on me
Come on

I'm dizzy, drunk and fightin'
On tequila white lightnin'
Yes, my glass is getting shorter
On whiskey, ice and water
Yeah, so come on, have a good time
And get blinded out of your mind
So don't worry about tomorrow
Take it today
Forget about the check
We'll get hell to pay

Have a drink on me
Have a drink on me
Yeah, have a drink on me
Have a drink on me
Get stoned

Have a drink on me
Oh, have a drink on me, yeah
Oh, have a drink on me
Come on

Oh, gonna roll around
Gonna hit the ground
Take another swig
Have another drink
Gonna drink it dry
Gonna get me high
Come on all the boys
Make a noise
Have a drink on me (have a drink on me)
Have a drink on me (have a drink on me)
Oh, have a drink on me (have a drink on me)

Have a drink on me
Have a drink on me
Have a drink on me
