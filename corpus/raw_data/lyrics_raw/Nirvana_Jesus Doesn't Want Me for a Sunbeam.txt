Jesus, don't want me for a sunbeam
Sunbeams are never made like me

Don't expect me to cry,
For all the reasons you had to die
Don't ever ask your love of me

Don't expect me to cry
Don't expect me to lie
Don't expect me to die for thee

Jesus, don't want me for a sunbeam
Sunbeams are never made like me

Don't expect me to cry,
For all the reasons you had to die
Don't ever ask your love of me

(x2)
Don't expect me to cry
Don't expect me to lie
Don't expect me to die for thee

Jesus, don't want me for a sunbeam
Sunbeams are never made like me

Don't expect me to cry,
For all the reasons you had to die
Don't ever ask your love of me

Don't expect me to cry
Don't expect me to lie
Don't expect me to die
Don't expect me to cry
Don't expect me to lie
Don't expect me to die for thee

Originally by The Vaselines. Correct title should be "Jesus Don't
Want Me For a Sunbeam". An incorrect title, using "Doesn't", is printed
on the MTV Unplugged CD and covers. Though, I think the Vaselines used
the title "Jesus wants me for a sunbeam" ... !
