And they want us to grow up
But we don't want to get a job
We all need a decent rock
Where it's all kicking off

Baby it's all right
Baby it's all right
You don't need to cause a fuss
Baby it's all right
Baby it's all right
It's only us

We're just after cheaper thrills
Since the price went up on pills
From Stoke On Trent to Beverley Hills
You know it's all kicking off

Baby it's all right
Baby it's all right
You don't need to cause a fuss
Baby it's all right
Baby it's all right
It's only us
It's only us

Rock me amadeus

Well it's all kicking off

Baby it's all right
Baby it's all right
You don't need to cause a fuss
Baby it's all right
Baby it's all right
It's only us
It's only us

You don't need to cause a fuss
Baby it's all right
It's only us
