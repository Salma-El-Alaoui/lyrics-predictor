Sometimes when I just can't sleep
And you're on my mind and I'm hurting deep
At night, when the sun goes down
And the lights turn on and you're not around

I've been this way before
But it wasn't you do
This time I'm sure
I've been waiting for you

I dream when I call your name
And I'm in a place that I can't explain
And everything you see I can't come true
It's the way that it is
It's the way that I am through

I've been this way before
But it wasn't you do
This time I'm sure
I've been waiting for you
This time I'm sure
I've been waiting for you

I've been waiting for you
I've been waiting for you
I've been waiting for you
