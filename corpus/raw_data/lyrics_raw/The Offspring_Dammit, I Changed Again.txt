Hey, come inside
While I stand here acting bold
Can't stand to feel this way
Clear out the cobwebs in my soul

This time I turn around
And things have changed
Now I don't feel the same
Start a fight
I can't defend
One more time
Dammit, I changed again

Now I don't see
Things the way I did before
Can't stand to feel this way
Things i felt yesterday
Don't matter anymore
It doesn't make any sense
To feel so different day to day
(Can't stand to feel this way)
When nothing's changed except for (me?)

(x4)
Next time I turned around
And things have changed
Now I don't feel the same
Start a fight
I can't defend
One more time
Dammit, I changed again

I see it
