This is the heartbreak hotel
This is the heartbreak hotel
This is the heartbreak hotel
This is the heartbreak hotel

You said that you'd be here by nine
Instead you took your time
You didn't think to call me (boy)
Here I sit
trying not to cry
Asking myself why
you do this to me

CHOURUS:
Since you're not around for me to tell you baby face to face
I'm writing you this letter, and this is what I have to say:oooh (babe)
All I really wanted was some of your time
Instead you told me lies
When someone else was on your mind
What do you do to me
Look what you did to me
I thought that you were someone who would do me right
until you played with my emotions and you made me cry
What did you do to me
Can't take what you did to me

Now I see that you been doing wrong
You played me all along.
And made a fool of me, babe ahh
You got it all wrong to think that I wouldn't find out
That you were cheating on me. darlin
How could you do it to me?

I ain't goin' to take it no more

Everything that you said was a lie
Don't lie to me
