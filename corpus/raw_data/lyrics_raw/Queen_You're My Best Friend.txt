Ooo, you make me live
Whatever this world can give to me
It's you, you're all I see
Ooo, you make me live now honey
Ooo, you make me live

You're the best friend that I ever had
I've been with you such a long time
You're my sunshine
And I want you to know that my feelings are true
I really love you
You're my best friend

Ooo, you make me live
I've been wandering 'round
But I still came back to you
In rain or shine you've stood by me girl
I'm happy, happy at home
You're my best friend

Ooo, you make me live
Whenever this world is cruel to me
I got you to help me forgive
Ooo, you make me live now honey
Ooo, you make me live

You're the first one when things turn out bad
You know I'll never be lonely
You're my only one
And I love the things
I really love the things that you do
You're my best friend

Ooo, you make me live
I'm happy, happy at home
You're my best friend
You're my best friend
Ooo, you make me live
You, you're my best friend
