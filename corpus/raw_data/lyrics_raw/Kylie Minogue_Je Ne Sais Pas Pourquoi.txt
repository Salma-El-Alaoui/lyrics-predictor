Rain falling down
Another minute passes by
I wait for you
But this time I won't cry
Where are you now
Are you with another love
It's not the first time
You stood me up and let me down

CHORUS:
I, I I'm wondering why
I still love you
Je ne sais pas pourquoi
I still want you
Je ne sais pas pourquoi

Lights about town
Expect me just to hang around
And you never call
You just stand me up and let me down

CHORUS

I, I I I

All through the night
I wanted you to come around
I wait too long
I know you're gonna let me down

CHORUS:
repeat last 4 lines twice
