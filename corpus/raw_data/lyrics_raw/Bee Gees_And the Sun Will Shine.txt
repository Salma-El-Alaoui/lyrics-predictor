And the rain will fall, it falls for you.
And the clouds will break into tears,
you should be here standing so near to me.

'Cept I know you should be sad
But give me time alone to get it out of my mind.
Though say I know it's only the weather.
'Cause ev'ry time it rains you are gone.
And I'm blue.
Then I wake up, then I wake up.

And the sun will shine if just for you.
And the trees will talk to the skies, whispering lies,
heaven will pass to me, yeah.
Trains walk by and the birds disappear.
Oh! Why am I still here without you by my side.
So I cry your name and love,
the thought to me is back and how near.
Then I wake up, then I grow up.

And the rain will fall.
It falls for you .
And the clouds will break
It should be near.
And the sun will shine
if just for you
And the love....
