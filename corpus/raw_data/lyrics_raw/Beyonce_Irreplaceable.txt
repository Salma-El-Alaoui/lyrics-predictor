To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left

To the left, to the left
Everything you own in the box to the left
In the closet, that's my stuff
Yes, if I bought it, baby please don't touch
And keep talking that mess, that's fine
But could you walk and talk at the same time, and
It's my name that's on that Jag
So go move your bags, let me call you a cab

Standing in the front yard
Telling me how I'm such a fool
Talking bout how I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted

You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you in a minute
Matter fact he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking you're irreplaceable

So go ahead and get gone
Call up that chick and see if she's home
Oops, I bet ya thought that I didn't know
What did you think I was putting you out for?
Because you was untrue
Rolling her around in the car that I bought you
Baby drop them keys
Hurry up before your taxi leaves

Standing in the front yard
Telling me how I am such a fool
Talking about how I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted

You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you in a minute
Matter fact he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I will have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable

So since Iâm not your everything
How about I'll be nothing
Nothing at all to you
Baby I won't shed a tear for you
I won't lose a wink of sleep
because the truth of the matter is
Replacing you is so easy

To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left
Mmmm
To the left, to the left
Everything you own in the box to the left
To the left, to the left
Don't you ever for a second get to thinking you're irreplaceable

You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you in a minute
Matter of fact he'll be be here in a minute, baby
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking, baby

You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you in a minute
Matter of fact he'll be be here in a minute
You can pack all you bags, we finished
Cause you made your bed, now lay in it
I could have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable
