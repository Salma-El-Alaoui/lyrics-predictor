Do you feel this?
I'm gonna feel this
Are you ready?
I don't think so

Somebody give me my truck
So I can ride on the clouds
So I can turn up the pace, like...

Somebody pass my guitar
So I can look like a star
And spend the cash, like...

What you gonna do when the crowd goes "eoh"
Why you standing on the wall?
Music's starting everywhere
So why don't you just move along?

I see you looking at me
Like I'm some kind of a freak
Get up out of your seat
Why don't you do somethin'?

I see you looking at me
Like I got what you need
Get up out of your seat
Why don't you do somethin'?

Now you all in my grill
Cause I say what I feel
Only rock to what's real
Bum bum

But I can't do that with you
I'll be here with my crew
You can roll if you can
Don't be a bum bum

What you gonna do when the crowd goes "eoh"
Why you standing on the wall
Music's starting everywhere
So why don't you just move along

I see you looking at me
Like I'm some kind of a freak
Get up out of your seat
Why don't you do somethin'?

I see you looking at me
Like I got what you need
Get up out of your seat
Why don't you do somethin'?

I see you looking at me
Like I'm some kind of a freak
Get up out of your seat
Why don't you do somethin'?

(Na na na na na na na) [x3] (Uh-huh)
(Na na na na na na na) [x3]

I see you lookin' over here
Can't you tell I'm having fun?
If you know it like I know
You would stop!
Let's turn it up!
And get you into space
And do somethin'!

I see you looking at me
Like I'm some kind of a freak
Get up out of your seat
Why don't you do somethin'?

I see you looking at me
Like I got what you need
Get up out of your seat
Why don't you do somethin'?

I see you looking at me
Like I'm some kind of a freak
Get up out of your seat
Why don't you do somethin'?

Fuck!
Do somethin'!
Why don't you do somethin'?!
