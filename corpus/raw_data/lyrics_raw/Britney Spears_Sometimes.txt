SOMETIMES (Britney Spears)

You tell me you're in love with me
Like you can't take your pretty eyes away from me
It's not that I don't wanna stay
But everytime you come too close I move away
I wanna believe in everything that you say
A'Cause it sounds so good
But if you really want me, move slow
There's things about me you just have to know

CHORUS
Sometimes I run
Sometimes I hide
Sometimes I'm scared of you
But all I really want is to hold you tight
Treat you right, be with you day and night
Baby all I need is time

I don't wanna be so shy, uh-uh
Everytime that I'm alone I wonder why
Hope that you will wait for me
You'll see that, you're the only one for me
I wanna believe in everything that you say
Ah 'cause it sounds so good
But if you really want me, move slow
There's things about me, you just have to know

CHORUS
Sometimes I run
Sometimes I hide
Sometimes I'm scared of you
But all I really want is to hold you tight
Treat you right, be with you day and night
All I really want is to hold you tight
Treat you right, be with you day and night
Baby all I need is time

CHORUS
Just hang around and you'll see
There's no where I'd rather be
If you love me, trust in me
The way that I trust in you

CHORUS
Sometimes I run
Sometimes I hide
Sometimes I'm scared of you
But all I really want is to hold you tight
Treat you right, be with you day and night
Sometimes I run
Sometimes I hide
Sometimes I'm scared of you
But all I really want is to hold you tight
Treat you right, be with you day and night

CHORUS
All I really want is to hold you tight
Be with you day and night

CHORUS
Sometimes I run
times I hide
Sometimes I'm scared of you
But all I really want is to hold you tight
Treat you right, be with you day and night(fade out)
