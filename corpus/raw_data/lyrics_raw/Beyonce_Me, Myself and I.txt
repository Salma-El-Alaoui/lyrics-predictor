ALL THE LADIES IF YOU FEEL ME HELP ME SING IT OUT

verse 1:
I CANT BELIEVE I BELIEVED EVERYTHING WE HAD WOULD LAST
SO YOUNG AND NAIVE OF ME TO THINK SHE WAS FROM YOUR PAST
SILLY OF ME TO DREAM OF ONE DAY HAVING YOUR KIDS
LOVE IS SO BLIND
IT FEELS RIGHT WHENS ITS WRONG
I CANT BELIEVE I FELL FOR YOUR SCHEMES
IM SMARTER THAN THAT
SO DUMB AND NAIVE TO BELIEVE WITH ME YOU'RE A CHANGED MAN
FOOLISH OF ME TO COMPETE
WHEN YOU CHEAT WITH LOOSE WOMEN
IT TOOK ME SOME TO REALIZE BUT NOW I MOVED ON
BECAUSE I REALIZED I GOT

chorus:
ME MYSELF AND I IS ALL I GOT IN THE END IS WHAT I FOUND OUT
AND THERE AIN'T NO NEED TO CRY
I TOOK A VOW FROM NOW ON I'M GON' BE MY OWN BEST FRIEND
ME MYSELF AND I IS ALL I GOT IN THE END IS WHAT I FOUND OUT
AND THERE AIN'T NO NEED TO CRY
I TOOK A VOW FROM NOW ON I'M GON' BE MY WON BEST FRIEND

verse 2:
SO CONTROLLING
YOU SAY YOU LOVE ME BUT YOU DONT
YOUR FAMILY TOLD ME ONE DAY I WOULD SEE IT ON MY OWN
NEXT THING I KNOW IM DEALING WITH YOUR THREE KIDS IN MY HOME
LOVE IS SO BLIND
IT FEELS RIGHT WHEN ITS WRONG
NOW THAT ITS OVER STOPPING CALLING ME
COME PICK UP YOUR CLOTHES
AIN'T NO NEED TO FRONT LIKE YOU'RE STILL WITH ME
ALL YOUR HOMIES KNOW
EVEN YOUR BEST FRIEND TRIED TO WARNED ME ON THE LOW
TOOK ME SOME TIME BUT NOW IM STRONG

chorus:
ME MYSELF AND I IS ALL I GOT IN THE END IS WHAT I FOUND OUT
AND THERE AIN'T NO NEED TO CRY
I TOOK A VOW FROM NOW ON I'M GON' BE MY OWN BEST FRIEND
ME MYSELF AND I IS ALL I GOT IN THE END IS WHAT I FOUND OUT
AND THERE AIN'T NO NEED TO CRY
I TOOK A VOW FROM NOW ON I'M GON' BE MY OWN BEST FRIEND

bridge:
NOW I GOT ME MYSELF AND I
I KNOW THAT I WILL NEVER DISAPPOINT MYSELF
I HAVE CRIED A THOUSAND TIMES
SO MANY BAD TIMES SPENT WITH YOU
BUT IM ABOUT TO MAKE IT THROUGH
repeat 3x
