If you think you can well, Come on man,
I was a Green Beret in Vietnam.
I said no more of your fairy stories
Cause I got my other worries.

Chorus:
53rd & 3rd
Standing on the street.
53rd & 3rd
I'm trying to turn a trick.
53rd & 3rd
You're the one they never pick.
53rd & 3rd
Don't it make you feel sick?

If you think you can well, Come on man,
I was a Green Beret in Vietnam.
I said no more of your fairy stories
Cause I got my other worries.

Chorus:
53rd & 3rd
Standing on the street.
53rd & 3rd
I'm trying to turn a trick.
53rd & 3rd
You're the one they never pick.
53rd & 3rd
Don't it make you feel sick?

Then I took out my razor blade.
Then I did what God forbade.
Now the cops are after me.
But I proved that I am no sissy.

Chorus:
53rd & 3rd
Standing on the street.
53rd & 3rd
I'm trying to turn a trick.
53rd & 3rd
You're the one they never pick.
53rd & 3rd
Don't it make you feel sick?

53rd & 3rd.
