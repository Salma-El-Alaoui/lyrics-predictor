Good and bad, I swear I've had the both they're overrated
But isn't it fun, when you get hold of one
Some go bad and some come back, the good ones all get taken
I'm calling a bluff, you ain't strong enough

Wait and pray you'll pick on me,
The day I raise my hand
Guess that I've been blessed, but I'll be damned

Halo
God only knows
Right behind me everywhere I go

Halo
God only knows
Right behind me everywhere I go

Say your prayers when you get scared,
pray you're gonna make it
and then we're done, you keep fucking up
One day soon I'll disappear and if you'll come I'll take you
Somewhere go, to keep from growing old

Wait and pray you'll pick on me,
The day I raise my hand
Guess that I've been blessed, but I'll be damned

Halo
God only knows
Right behind me everywhere I go

Halo
God only knows
Right behind me everywhere I go

Oh......
Oh......
Oh......

Disappear the light is fading
Disappear outside their rage
Disappear I'm tired of waiting
Disappear before we fade away

Halo
God only knows
Right behind me everywhere I go

Halo
God only knows
Right behind me everywhere I go
