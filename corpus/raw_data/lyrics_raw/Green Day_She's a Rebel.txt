She's a rebel
She's a saint
She's the salt of the earth
And she's dangerous

She's a rebel
Vigilante
Missing link on the brink
Of destruction

From Chicago to Toronto
She's the one that they
Call old whatsername

She's the symbol
of resistance
and she's holding on my
heart like a hand grenade

Is she dreaming
what I'm thinking?
Is she the mother of all bombs
gonna detonate?

Is she trouble
like I'm trouble?
Make it a double
twist of fate
or a melody that

She sings the revolution
the dawning of our lives
she brings this liberation
that I just can't define
nothing comes to mind
''(x2)''

She's a rebel
She's a saint
She's the salt of the earth
And she's dangerous

She's a rebel
Vigilante
Missing link on the brink
Of destruction
''(x2)''

She's a rebel, She's a rebel, She's a rebel, And she's dangerous
She's a rebel, She's a rebel, She's a rebel, And she's dangerous
