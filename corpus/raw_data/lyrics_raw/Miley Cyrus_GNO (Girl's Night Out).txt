Don't call me, leave me alone
 Not gonna answer my phone
 'Cuz I don't, no I won't see you

I'm out to have a good time
 To get you off of my mind
 'Cuz I don't, and I won't need you

Send out a 911
 We're gonna have some fun
 Hey boy, you know you better run

'Cuz it's a girls' night
 It's alright without you
 I'm gonna stay out
 And play out without you

You better hold tight
 'Cuz girls' night's without you
 Let's go GNO, let's go GNO
 Let's go GNO, let's go
 It's a girls' night

I'll dance with somebody new
 Don't have to think about you
 And who knows what let go will lead to

You'll hear from everyone
 You'll get the 411
 Hey boy, you knew this day would come

'Cuz it's a girls' night
 It's alright without you
 I'm gonna stay out
 And play out without you

Let's go GNO, let's go GNO
 Let's go GNO, let's go

Hey boy, don't you wish you
 Could've been a good boy
 Try to find another girl like me boy
 Feel me when I tell ya I am fine
 And it's time for me to draw the line, I said

Hey boy, don't you wish you
 Could've been a good boy
 Try to find another girl like me boy
 Feel me when I tell ya I am fine
 And it's time for me to draw the line

'Cuz it's a girls' night
 It's alright without you
 I'm gonna stay out
 And play out without you

You better hold tight
 'Cuz girls' night's without you
 Let's go GNO, let's go GNO
 Let's go GNO, let's go
 It's a girls' night
