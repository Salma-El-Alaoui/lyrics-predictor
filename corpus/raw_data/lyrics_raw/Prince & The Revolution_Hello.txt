Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello I tried 2 tell them that I didn't want 2 sing
But I'd gladly write a song instead
They said okay and everything was cool
'Til a camera tried 2 get in my bed

Hello My bed Hello Hello

I was sittin' pretty with a beautiful friend ("Oh darling")
When this man tries 2 get in the car
("'Ey Prince, c'mon, give us a smile eh?")
No introduction, "How U been?"
Just "Up yours, smile, that's right, you're a star!" (Star)

U call 'em bodyguards but I call 'em my friends
I guess I'm used 2 havin' 'em around
And cameras by nature like rewards
That's the trouble I get when I'm Uptown

I'm not afraid to die (Don't be afraid)
Oh no, there's a better place ('Cuz there's a better place 2 go)
I eat what I want (U can eat what U want)
Whole wheat toast (Anything is cool in moderation)
And I'm happy, and that's for sure We're against hungry children
Our record stands tall
There's just as much hunger here at home We'll do what we can
If y'all try and understand
A flower that has water will grow
And the child misunderstood will go Hello
Hello
Hello
