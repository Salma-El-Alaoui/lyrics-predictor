It wasn't raining yet
but it was definitely getting a little misty on
that warm November night
And my heart was pounding,
my inner voice resounding,
begging me to turn away
But I just had to see your face
to feel alive

And then you casually walked in the room
and I was twisted in the web
of my desire for you
(And I was twisted)
My apprehension blew away
I only wanted you
to taste my sadness
as you kissed me in the dark

Chorus:
Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
and go back in time
to relive the splendor of you and I
on the rooftop that rainy night

And so we finished the Moet and
I started feeling liberated
And I surrendered as you took me
in your arms
I was so caught up in the moment
I couldn't bear to let you go yet
so I threw caution to the wind
and started listening to my longing heart

And then you softly pressed your lips to mine
and the feelings surfaced I'd surpressed
for such a long time
(And I was lifted)
And for awhile I forgot
the sorrow and the pain
and melted with you as we stood
there in the rain

Chorus (2x)

Last night I dreamed that I
whispered the words I love you
and touched you so very
subtly as we were kissing goodbye
(Pretty baby -- how I'm missing you)

Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
(Envision you caressing me)
and go back in time
(I go back)
to relive the splendor of you and I
on the rooftop that rainy night
(on the roof that rainy night)

Every time I feel the need
(When I feel the need)
I envision you caressing me
(I envision you over and over and over again)
and go back in time
to relive the splendor of you and I
(It was oh so sweet, you and I)
on the rooftop that rainy night
(on that rainy night)

Every time I feel the need
(Last night I had the strangest dream ... )
I envision you caressing me
(It was actually quite symbolic)
and I go back in time
(As I whispered ... that I loved you)
to relive the splendor of you and I
( ... very subtly)

Chorus (1x)
