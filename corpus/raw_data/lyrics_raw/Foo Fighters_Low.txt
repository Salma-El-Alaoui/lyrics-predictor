Hey you, are you in there
I'm stuck outside you
We can use, one another
Another like you

(Chorus)
You be my passer by
I'll be your new, one that passed through
Screws inside, turned so tight
Turning on you, I'm hanging on you

Baby Blue (baby blue)
Don't go nowhere (don't go nowhere)
I'm right beside you
Me and you (me and you)
Going nowhere (going nowhere)
I'm right beside you

(Chorus)

Taking you as low as you go
As low as you go
Taking you as low as you go
As low as you go

(Chorus)

Taking you as low as you go (low as you go)
As low as you go (low as you go)
Taking you as low as you go (low as you go)
As low as you go (as low as you go)
(low as you go, as low as you go)x2
(low as you go)

Taking you as low as you go
As low as you go
Taking you as low as you go
As low as you go

Taking you as low as you go (low as you go)
As low as you go (low as you go)
Taking you as low as you go (low as you go)
As low as you go (as low as you go)
