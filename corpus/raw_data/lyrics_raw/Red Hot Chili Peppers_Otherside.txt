How long how long will I slide
Separate my side
I don't
I don't believe it's fair
Slittin' my throat
It's all I ever

I heard your voice through a photograph
I thought it up and brought up the past
Once you know you can never go back
I've got to take it on the otherside

Centuries are what it meant to me
A cemetery where I married the sea
Stranger things could never change my mind
I've got to take it on the otherside
Take it on the otherside
Take it on
Take it on

How long how long will I slide
Separate my side
I don't
I don't believe it's fair
Slittin' my throat
It's all I ever

Pour my life into a paper cup
The ashtray's full and I'm spillin' my guts
She wants to know am I still a slut
I've got to take it on the otherside

A scarlet starlet and she's in my bed
A candidate for a soul mate bled
Push the trigger and pull the thread
I've got to take it on the otherside
Take it on the otherside
Take it on
Take it on

How long how long will I slide
Separate my side
I don't
I don't believe it's fair
Slittin' my throat
It's all I ever

Turn me on, take me for a hard ride
Burn me out leave me on the otherside
I yell and tell it that
It's not my friend
I tear it down I tear it down
But then it's born again

How long how long will I slide
Separate my side
I don't
I don't believe it's fair
Slittin' my throat
It's all I ever
How long... how long
I don't
I don't believe it's fair
Slittin' my throat
It's all I ever
