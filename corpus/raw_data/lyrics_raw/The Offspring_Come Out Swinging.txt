You brace and hold it all inside
It's more than you can stand
No one around even tries
Tries to understand

Don't turn away, don't turn away
Come out swinging
Come out alone
They're in your way, they're in your way
But as long as you're swinging
Strong then you'll get by

Your pacing's wearing out a line
Right beside your bed
The scene replays a million times
Stuck inside your head

And though you stay in place
Your mind escapes
Read between the lies
Smile's on your face
You fake like you're ok

Don't turn away, don't turn away
Come out swinging
come Out alone
They're in your way, they're in your way
You may be stinging
But you'll get by
Don't turn away, don't turn away
Come out swinging
Never alone again
The pain inside can guide your way

Midnight, no sleep though
Inside, you scream to
No one, hears you for
Daylight, prove me today day
One more try

Don't turn away, don't turn
Come out swinging
Come out alone
They're in your way, they're in your way
You may be stinging
But you'll get by
Don't turn away, don't turn away
Come out swinging
Never alone again
Pain inside
Leads you (leads you) through so you'll get by
