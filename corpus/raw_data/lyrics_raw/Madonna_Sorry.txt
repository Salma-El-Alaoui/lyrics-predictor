Sorry

Je suis désolé
Lo siento
Ik ben droevig
Sono spiacente
Perdóname

I've heard it all before
I've heard it all before
I've heard it all before
I've heard it all before
(repeat)

I don't want to hear
I don't want to know
Please don't say you're sorry
I've heard it all before
And I can take care of myself

I don't want to hear
I don't want to know
Please don't say 'forgive me'
I've seen it all before
And I can't take it anymore

You're not half the man you think you are
Save your words because you've gone too far
I've listened to your lies and all your stories
You're not half the man you'd like to be

I don't want to hear
I don't want to know
Please don't say you're sorry
I've heard it all before
And I can take care of myself

I don't want to hear
I don't want to know
Please don't say 'forgive me'
I've seen it all before
And I can't take it anymore

Don't explain yourself cause talk is cheap
There's more important things than hearing you speak
We stayed because I made it so convenient
Don't explain yourself you'll never see

(Sorry in multiple languages)
(Sorry, in english, looped multiple times)

I've heard it all before

I don't want to hear
I don't want to know
Please don't say you're sorry
I've heard it all before
And I can take care of myself

I don't want to hear
I don't want to know
Please don't say 'forgive me'
I've seen it all before
And I can't take it anymore

Don't explain yourself cause talk is cheap
There's more important things than hearing you speak
