I wander round the room and I'm getting things ready
I picture you driving just like Mario Andretti
I got the kush, Ketel One, waiting for your engine
Your Grand Prix, your tension, it's gonna be a party

Don't forget to make a U-turn

Meet me back at home, ayo ayo

Driving fast in your car

You got me so addicted, just like a free-baser
I want you all over me like L.A.M.B.
So get here A.S.A.P., it's gonna be a party

Don't forget to make a U-turn (Don't forget to get here)
I see you left your blinker on (You see I want to get it on)
I got it rolled and ready here to burn
Meet me back at home, ayo ayo (You know you need me, so come back)

Drive back, baby, to me fast in your car

Drive back, baby, to me fast in your car
I'm here waiting, crash into me real hard

Now you know you're qualified
You're in the pole position
Put it in first gear, step on the pedal and drive fast

Back it up, back it up
You got it, you got it
Back it up, back it up
You got it, you got it

Put your hands up, put your hands up
Put your hands up, uh uh uh
You got it, you got it

Put your hands up, put your hands up
Put your hands up, uh uh uh
You got it
