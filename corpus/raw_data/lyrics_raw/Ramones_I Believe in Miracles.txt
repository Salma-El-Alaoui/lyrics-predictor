I used to be on a endless run
Believe in miracles 'cause i'm one
I've been blessed with the power to survive
And after all these years i'm still alive
I'm outta here kickin' with the band
I'm no longer a solitary man
Every day my time runs out
Lived like a fool that what i was about oh,

I believe in miracles
I believe in a better world, for me and you
oooh, and I believe in miracles
I believe in a better world for me and you

Tatooed your name on my arm
I always said my girl is a good luck charm
If she can find a reason to forgive
Then i can find a reason to live
I used to be on a endless run
Believe in miracles 'cause i'm one
I've been blessed with the power to survive
And after all these years i'm still alive

Ohh I believe in miracles
I believe in a better world for me and you
Ohh I believe in miracles
I believe in a better world for me and you

I close my eyes and it think how
It might be
The future is here today
It's not too late
It's not too late no!

Ohh I believe in miracles
And I believe in a better world for me and you
Ohh I believe in miracles
And I believe in a better world for me and you
