It ain't nothin' but an us thing

And it's time for us to step it up and respect

That level of sisterhood that's been holdin' up our neighborhood

And if it wasn't for our mothers there would be no brothers

And if it wasn't for our sisters there would be no misters

So it ain't nothing but an us thing

She's strong and that's a fact

Not it's time for us to take up the slack

Step it up, step it up time to go to work



History hidden from me

To hide my identity

So I'd never feel

I am somebody

You've gouged my eyes

I see more clearly

You've tried to rub me of my humanity

My spirit you tried to break

My soul you tried to take

There's no need to be afraid

&amp;quot;Cause I won't do unto you now



Chorus:

Amen

All that we've been through

Our time has come to rejoice

A new agenda's due

Amen

It's time to know the truth

Our time has come to rejoice

A new agenda's due



Because of my gender

I've heard &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; too many times

Because of my race

I've heard &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; to many times

But with every &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; I grow in strength

That is why

African American women

I stand tall with pride

You want to know what it takes

To rid yourself of me now

There's nothing you can do

Accept me for who I am now



Repeat Chorus



Time to step it up, step it up

Better check yourself

I got vexed to protect what we got

Left her alone

Lookin' for your own

Here it is I know what I'm sayin'

But the Klan ain't playin' at the range

Gotta step it up us to a discuss a must

It ain't nothin' but an us thing

Rewind back to the time

Where the color of our mother

Had 'em call it a crime

Brother what in the world?

And the world says where in the black man

Support the women and the children

Time to step it up, step it up, it's play off time

And the rhyme go to check, so check yourself



Repeat Chorus
