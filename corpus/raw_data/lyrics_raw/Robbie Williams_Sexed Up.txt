Loose lips sunk ships
I'm getting to grips
With what you've said
No it's not in my head
I can't awaken the dead day after day.
Why don't we talk about it?
Why do you always doubt that there could be a better way?
It doesn't make me wanna stay

(Chorus)
Why don't we break up?
There's nothing left to say
I've got my eyes shut, praying they won't stray
and we're not sexed up
That's what makes the difference today
I hope you blow away

You say we're fatally flawed
Well I'm easily bored, Is that okay?
Strike me off your list
Make this the last kiss
I'll walk away

Why don't we talk about it?
I'm only here
Don't shout it
Given time we'll forget
Let's pretend we never met

(Chorus)

Screw you, I didn't like your taste
Anyway, I chose you
and that's all gone to waste
It's Saturday, I'll go out and find another you

Chorus:

Why don't we
Why don't we break up
There's nothing left to say
I've got my eyes shut
Praying they won't stray
And we're not sexed up
That's what makes the difference today
I hope you blow away
I hope you blow away
I hope you blow away
I hope you blow away.
blow away
blow away
just blow away
