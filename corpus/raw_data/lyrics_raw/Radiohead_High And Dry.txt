Two jumps in a week
I bet you think that's pretty clever
Don't you boy
Flying on your motorcycle
Watching all the ground beneath you drop

You'd kill yourself for recognition
Kill yourself to never ever stop
You broke another mirror
You're turning into something you are not

Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry

Drying up in conversation
You will be the one who cannot talk
All your insides fall to pieces
You just sit there
Wishing you could still make love
They're the ones who'll hate you
When you think you've got the world
All sussed out
They're the ones who'll spit at you
You will be the one screaming out

Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry

It's the best thing that you ever had
The best thing that you ever, ever had
It's the best thing that you ever had
The best thing you have had, has gone away

Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry

Don't leave me high
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
