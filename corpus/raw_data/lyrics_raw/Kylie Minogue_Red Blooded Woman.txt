Count backwards 5 4 3 2 1,
Before you get too heated and turned on (and turned on),
You should have learned your lessons all them times before,
You've been bruised, you've been broken

Then there's my mind saying think before you go,
Through that door that take's me to nowhere (yes boy),
Has got you all romantic, crazy in your head,
You think I'd listen, no I don't care

Can't focus I can't stop,
You got me spinning round, round, round, round (like a record),
Can't focus it's too hot (inside),
You'll never get to Heaven if you're scared of getting high

Boy, boy,
Let me keep freaking around, I wanna get down,
And I'm a red blooded woman, what's the point in hanging round?
Boy, boy
I wanna keep turning it down,
When this girl wants to rock with you, yeah...

Boy, boy,
Let me keep freaking around, I wanna get down,
And I'm a red blooded woman, what's the point in hanging round?
Boy, boy
I wanna keep turning it down,
When this girl wants to rock with you, yeah...

My conscience saying, get down off the streets,
It's too dangerous and deadly (yes boy),
Has got you talking round in circles can't you see,
All for the sake of sexy (You're loving it),
And as my friends say, stop before you fall,
I don't wanna pick you up again (yes boy),
Has got you all romantic, crazier each day,
You think I'd listen, there's no way

Can't focus I can't stop,
You got me spinning round, round, round, round (like a record),
Can't focus it's too hot (Inside),
You'll never get to Heaven if you're scared of getting high

Boy, boy,
Let me keep freaking around, I wanna get down,
And I'm a red blooded woman, what's the point in hanging round?
Boy, boy
I wanna keep turning it down,
When this girl wants to rock with you, yeah...

Let me keep freaking around, I wanna get down,
And I'm a red blooded woman, what's the point in hanging round?

Let me keep freaking around (freaking around, freaking around),
Red blooded woman,
It's too hot inside,
You'll never get to Heaven if you're scared of getting high...

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la,
Freaking around....

Boy, boy,
Let me keep freaking around, I wanna get down,
And I'm a red blooded woman, what's the point in hanging round?
