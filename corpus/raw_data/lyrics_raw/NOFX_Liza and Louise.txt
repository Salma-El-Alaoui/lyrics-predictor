Liza's had enough of men
She said she won't get burned again
She said they don't know how to fuck
Her last boyfriend's a schmuck
Shared with her a nice disease
He kept her passive on her knees
Til one day she took his car
And drove into the city
Liza had put down a few
When she met this girl named Lou
Who convinced her to go home with her
She said, &amp;quot;My name's Louise
Now will you take off your clothes please?
I want to take you to the moon and back
So get on your back.&amp;quot;
With a flick of the tongue
She made her scream
She made her laugh
She made her dance
She was happy for the first time
And you know she wanted more
Now with her legs spread wider
She needed to have Louise inside her
She said, &amp;quot;I'll never forget the first time
You kissed me, now I want you to fist me.&amp;quot;
Louise didn't need a second invitation
She knew just what to do
Yeah, she knew just what to do
Liza had cum a few times before
But she had never even seen the door
Into the world of pleasures of the flesh
She felt just like 16
And her life before now was a dream
Or even a nightmare thats over and done
Just like warm healing rays
Shining from the sun
She made her scream
She made her laugh
She made her dance
She was happy for the first time
And you know she wanted more
You know she wanted more
You know she wanted more
