Chorus:
And we'll paint by numbers
Till something sticks
Don't mind doing it for the kids
So come on

Jump on board, take a ride, yeah
(You'll be doin' it alright)
Jump on board, feel the high, yeah
'Cause the kids are alright

K: You've got a reputation
R: Well I guess that could be explored
K: You're dancing with the chairman of the board
R: Take a ride on my twelve cylinder symphony
But if you've got other plans
K: The purpose of a woman is to love her man

And we'll paint by numbers
Till something sticks
Don't mind doing it for the kids
So come on

Jump on board, take a ride, yeah
(You'll be doin' it alright)
Jump on board, feel the high, yeah
'Cause the kids are alright

I'm gonna give it all of my loving
It's gonna take up all of my love
I'm gonna give it all of my loving
It's gonna take up all of my love (x4)

K: Come down from the ceiling
R: I didn't mean to get so high
K: I couldn't do what I wanted to do when my lips were dry
R: You can't just up and leave me I'm a singer in a band
K: Well I like drummers baby you're not my bag

Jump on board, take a ride, yeah
(You'll be doin' it alright)
Jump on board, feel the high, yeah
'Cause the kids are alright x2

I'm an honorary Sean Connery, born '74
There's only one of me
Single-handedly raising the economy
Ain't no chance of the record company dropping me
Press be asking do I care for sodomy
I don't know, yeah, probably
I've been looking for serial monogamy
Not some bird that looks like Billy Connolly
But for now I'm down with ornithology
Grab your binoculars, come follow me
