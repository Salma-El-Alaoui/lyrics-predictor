Everybody comes to Hollywood
They wanna make it in the neighborhood
They like the smell of it in Hollywood
How could it hurt you when it looks so good

Chorus:

Shine your light now
This time it's gotta be good yah
You get it right now
'Cause you're in Hollywood oh

There's something in the air in Hollywood
The sun is shining like you knew it would would would
You're ridin' in your car in Hollywood
You got the top down and it feels so good oooooooooh

Everybody comes to Hollywood
They wanna make it in the neighborhood
They like the smell of it in Hollywood
How could it hurt you when it looks so good

I lost my memory in Hollywood
I've had a million visions, bad and good
There's something in the air in Hollywood it is so good
I tried to leave it but I never could

(chorus)

There's something in the air in Hollywood
I've lost my reputation, bad and good
You're ridin' in your car in Hollywood
You got the top down and it feels so good

Music stations always play the same songs
I'm bored with the concept of right and wrong

Everybody comes to Hollywood
They wanna make it in the neighborhood
They like the smell of it in Hollywood
How could it hurt you when it looks so good

(chorus)

'Cause you're in Hollywood
'Cause you're in Hollywood
In Hollywood (repeat three times)

Check it out, this bird has flown

(chorus)

'Cause you're in Hollywood
'Cause you're in Hollywood
In Hollywood (repeat three times)

Push the button
Don't push the button
Trip the station
Change the channel Hey!
(repeat four time)
