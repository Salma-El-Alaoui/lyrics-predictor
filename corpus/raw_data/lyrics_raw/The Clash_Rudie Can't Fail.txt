Sing Michael sing - on the route of the 19 bus!
Hear them sayin'
How you get a rude and a reckless
don't you be so crude and a feckless
you bin drinking brew for breakfast
Rudie can't fail

So we reply
I know that my life makes you nervous
But I tell you that I can't live in service
Like the doctor who was born for a purpose
Rudie can't fail

I went to the market to realize my soul
'cause what I need I just don't have
First they curse, then they press me till I hurt
We say Rudie can't fail

We hear them sayin'
Now first you must cure your temper
Then you find a job in the paper
You need someone for a saviour
Oh Rudie can't fail

We reply
Now we get a rude and a reckless
We been seen lookin' cool an' a speckless
We been drinkin' brew for breakfast
So Rudie can't fail

I went to the market to realize my soul
'cause what I need I just don't have
First they curse, then they press me till I hurt
We say Rudie can't fail

OKAY!
So where you wanna go today?
Hey boss man!
You're looking pretty smart
In your chicken skin suit
You think you're pretty hot
In your pork pie hat
But ... Rudie can't fail
Lookout, lookout
Skyjuice! ... 10 Cents a bottle
