I gave my love, I gave my life
I gave my body and mind
We were inseparable
I guess I gave U all of my time
And now U plead insanity
And U don't even know the score
Why can't U learn 2 play the game, baby?
Don't U know that U need more? (More, more, more, more)
U need another lover
Like U need a hole in yo’ head (Baby, baby)
U know there ain't no other
That can do the duty in yo’ bed (Yeah, yeah)

We were brothers and sisters {lines repeat in BG}
United all 4 love
Now all of a sudden U try 2 fight it
U say U’ve had enough
Even though we had (big) fun
U want another someone, yo’ happily ever after be
(As sure as there’s a sun)
Sho’, sho’ as the sun, I wanna be the one
U don't understand? Face 2 face, baby, I'll tell U down on my knees
Yeah yeah

U need another lover
Like U need a hole in yo’ head (Baby, baby)
U know there ain't no other
That can do the duty in yo’ bed (Solo, solo)

(Sinkin’)
Yeah, oh Lord

U need another lover
U know there ain't no other

U need another lover
Like U need a hole in yo’ head
Hole in yo’ head {x2}
[(I do believe U’re on the rebound now)]
U need another lover
Like U need a hole, a hole, a hole, a hole, uh

U need another lover (Well)
U know there ain't no other

There's gonna be a riot if U don't clap your hands
If U don't make that funky stand
Everybody... {fade out}
U know there ain't no other
