Look at me I'm falling
Off a cliff now
I can still hear my mama yelling no no no
But the words mean nothing
Can't catch up to me now
And the view is so beautiful
All the way down
When I was a little boy
Sucking juice from a bottle
Believeing my perceptions were oh so real
But I didn't know nothing
Still know nothing
Was just enough for me to know the way I feel

This is life
What a fucked up thing we do
What a nightmare come true
Or a playground if we choose
And I choose

Look at me I'm swollen
Like a bananafish now
I'm never gonna make it out of my hole
But I keep on laughing
Doesn't really matter
There's dozens of reasons for explaining my soul
When I was a teenager
Suckin' booze with the vatos
Discussing who was gonna live to be 21
They said they wouldn't make it
They didn't make it
We're all naked when the day is said and done

This is life
What a fucked up thing we do
What a nightmare come true
Or a playground if we choose
And I choose

Don't know who made this all come true
But know while you're here
You just gotta do what you gotta do

Now if I wasn't such a weenie
Do you think you'd still love me
Prending I'm an airplane on the living room floor
But like a lovely generator
You stand right by me
And if words were wisdom I'd be talking even more
So I keep on falling
As I'm looking back above me
Watching as my mama just becomes a little dot
Now I'm like Deniro
I'm amarillo
And I'll never know when I hit the ground

This is life
What a fucked up thing we do
What a nightmare come true
Or a playground if we choose
And I choose
