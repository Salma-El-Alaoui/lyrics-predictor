Look at the red, red changes in the sky
Look at the separation in the borderline
(Don't look here inside)
But don't look at everything here inside
(Here inside)
And don't be afraid, afraid to speak your mind

It took a moment before I lost myself in here
It took a moment and I could not be found
Again and again and again and again
I see your face in everything
It took a moment, the moment it could not be found

What's with the fascination with the echelon?
What's with the constant questions that you have this time?
What's with this circumstantial consequence?
(Consequence)
Find oversight before this night will ever rise again

It's all you've got inside your head;
Better get up and leave instead

It took a moment before I lost myself in here
It took a moment and I could not be found
Again and again and again and again
I see your face in everything
It took a moment, the moment it could not be found

To find ourselves lost here within we need the reasons why
So we take this bridge with the others that will thrive in the great divide

Look at the red, red changes in the sky

Again and again and again and again
I see your face in everything
Again and again and again and again
I see your face in everything

It took a moment before I lost myself in here
It took a moment and I could not be found
Again and again and again and again
I see your face in everything
It took a moment, the moment it could not be found
