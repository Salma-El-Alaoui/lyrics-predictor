I'm nothing special
in fact, I'm a bit of a bore
if I tell a joke
you've probably heard it before
but I have a talent
a wonderful thing
cause everyone listens when I start to sing
I'm so grateful and proud
all I want is to sing it out loud
so I say

thank you for the music
the songs I'm singing
thanks for all the joy they're bringing
who can live without it
I ask in all honesty
what would life be
without a song or a dance what are we
so I say thank you for the music
for giving it to me

Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk
mmhmm, she says I began
to sing long before I could talk
and I've often wondered
how did it all start
who found out that nothing
can capture a heart
like a memory can
well, whoever it was
I'm a fan
so I say

thank you for the music
the songs I'm singing
thanks for all the joy they're bringing
who can live without it
I ask in all honesty
what would life be
without a song or a dance what are we
so I say thank you for the music
for giving it to me

I've been so lucky
I am the girl with golden hair
I wanna sing it out to everybody
what a joy
what a life
what a chance!
so I say

thank you for the music
the songs I'm singing
thanks for all the joy they're bringing
who can live without it
I ask in all honesty
what would life be
without a song or a dance what are we
so I say thank you for the music
for giving it
to me
