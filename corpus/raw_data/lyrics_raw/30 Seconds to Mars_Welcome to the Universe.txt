And so the time has come, it's here
The silence ends, a change is near

You wait in the palid slivered sky
Come into the pantheon

Welcome to the universe
Welcome to the universe

If there's a past into the clear
We better take the pace
Erase this face
In constant search for everything

You wait in the palid slivered sky
Come into the pantheon

Welcome to the universe
Welcome to the universe
Welcome to the universe
Welcome to the universe

(A new day has begun)
