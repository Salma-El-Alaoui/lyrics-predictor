I can't afford to breathe in this town
Nowhere to sit without a gun in my hand
Hooked back up to the cathode ray
I'm better off dead
I'm better off dead
I'm better off

Prove yourself
Prove yourself
Prove yourself

I want to breathe, I want to grow
I'd say I want it but I don't know how
I work, I bleed, I beg, I pray
But I'm better off dead
I'm better off dead
I'm better off

Prove yourself
Prove yourself
Prove yourself

I'm better off dead
I'm better off dead
I'm better off

Prove yourself
Prove yourself
Prove yourself
Prove yourself

Woah
