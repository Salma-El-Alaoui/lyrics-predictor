Honey its getting close to midnight
And all the myths are in town
True love and lipstick on your linen
Bite the pillow make no sound
If there's some living to be done
Before your life becomes your tomb
You'd better know that I'm the one
So unchain your back door invite me around

[Chorus]
Bring your daughter,bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go,let her go,let her go.
Bring your daughter,bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go,let her go,let her go.
Let her go

Honey its getting close to daybreak
The sun is creeping in the sky
No patent remedies for heartache
Just empty words and humble pie
So get down on your kneees honey
Assume an attitude
You just pray that I'll be waiting
Cos you know I'm coming soon

[Chorus]

Pick up your foolish pride,no going back
No where,no way,no place to hide

[solo]

Bring me your daughter, Bring me your daughter, Bring me your daughter, Bring me your daughter, Bring me your daughter, Bring me your daughter, To the slaughter.
Bring me your daughter, Bring me your daughter, Bring me your daughter, Bring me your daughter, Bring me your daughter, Bring me your daughter, To the slaughter.

Bring me your daughter, Fetch your daughter, Bring me your daughter, Fetch your daughter, Bring me your daughter, Fetch your daughter, To the slaughter.
Bring me your daughter, Fetch your daughter, Bring me your daughter, Fetch your daughter, Bring me your daughter, Fetch your daughter, To the slaughter.

[Chorus]X2
