It's just you jive talkin'
you're telling me lies, yeah,
Jive talkin'
you wear a disguise,
Jive talkin',
so misunderstood,
Jive talkin'
You're really no good.

Oh my child, you'll never know,
Just what you mean to me,
Oh my child, you got so much,
You're gonna take away my energy with all your

Jive talkin'
You're telling me lies, yeah
Good lovin'
Still gets in my eyes,
Nobody believes what you say,
It's just your
Jive talkin' that gets in the way

Oh my love, you're so good,
Treating me so cruel,
There you go, with your fancy lies,
Leavin' me looking like a love struck fool,

With all your jive talkin'
You're telling me lies, yeah,
Jive talkin'
You wear a disguise,
Jive talkin' so misunderstood, yeah
Jive talkin'
You just ain't no good.

Love talkin' is all very fine, yeah
Jive talkin' just isn't a crime,
And if there's somebody you'll love till you die,
Then all that jive talking'
Just gets in your eye.

Jive talkin'
you're tellin' me lies, yeah
Your lovin'
still gets in my eyes
Nobody' believe what you say,
It's just your Jive talkin'
that gets in the way

Love talkin' is all very fine, yeah
Jive talkin' just isn't a crime,
And if there's somebody you'll love till you die,
Then all that jive talking'
Just gets in your eye.

yeah, yeah.

Oh Jive talkin'
