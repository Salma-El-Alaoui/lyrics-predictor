Well it's a dog eat dog, eat cat too
The French eat frog, and I eat you
Business man when you make a deal
Do you know who you can trust
Do you sign your life away
Do you write your name in dust

Hey, hey, hey
Every dog has its day
It's a dog eat dog, dog eat dog

Dog eat dog, read the news
Someone win, someone lose
Up's above and down's below
And limbo's in between
Up you win, down you lose
It's anybody's game

Hey, hey, hey
Every dog has its day
It's a dog eat dog, dog eat dog

And it's a eye for eye
Tooth for tooth
It's a lie
That's the truth
See the blind man on the street
Lookin' for somethin' free
Hear the kind man ask his friend
What's in it for me

Hey, hey, hey
Every dog has its day
It's a dog eat dog, dog eat dog

Dog eat dog, Dog eat dog
Dog eat dog, Dog eat dog
Dog eat dog, Dog eat dog
Dog eat dog, Dog eat dog...
