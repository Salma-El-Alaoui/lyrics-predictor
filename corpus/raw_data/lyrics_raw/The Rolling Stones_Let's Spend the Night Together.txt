Don't you worry 'bout what's on your mind, oh my
I'm in no hurry, I can take my time, oh my
I'm going red and my tounge's getting tied (Tounge's getting tied)
I'm off my head and my mouth's getting dry
I'm high, but I try, try, try, oh my

Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together now

I feel so strong that I can't disguise, oh my
But I just can't apologize, oh no
Don't hang me up and don't let me down (Don't let me down)
We could have fun just groovin' around
Around, around, around, oh my

Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together

Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
You know I'm smiling, baby

You need some guiding, baby
I'm just deciding, baby, now
I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together
Let's spend the night together now
Oh my my my my my my my

This doesn't happen to me ev'ry day, oh my (Let's spend the night together)
No excuses offered anyway, oh my (Let's spend the night together)
I'll satisfy your every need (Your every need)
And now I know you will satisfy me
Oh my my my my my my

(Let's spend the night together)
(Now I need you more than ever)
(Let's spend the night together)
Together now, oh my my my my my my my
(Let's spend the night together)
Now I need you, need you more than ever, oh my
(Let's spend the night together)
I'll satisfy your every need, whoa my my
(Let's spend the night together)
Now I know, I know you'll satisfy me, whoa my my
(Let's spend the night together)
I beg you baby, whoa my my my my my my
