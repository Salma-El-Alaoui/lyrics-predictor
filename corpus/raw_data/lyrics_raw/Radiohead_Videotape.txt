When I'm at the pearly gates
This'll be on my videotape, my videotape
Mephistopheles is just beneath
And he's reaching up to grab me

This is one for the good old days
And I have it all here
In red, blue, green
Red, blue, green

You are my centre when I spin away
Out of control
On videotape
On videotape
On videotape
On videotape
On videotape
(On videotape)

This is my way of saying goodbye
Because I can't do it face to face
I'm talking to you before...

No matter what happens now
You shouldn't be afraid
Because I know today has been the most perfect day I've ever seen
