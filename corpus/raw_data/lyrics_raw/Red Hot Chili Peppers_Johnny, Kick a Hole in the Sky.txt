I, I, I, I, I cry
I cry
I was born in a land
I don't think you understand

I'm a native of this place
please don't kick me in my face
my race
has been disgraced

won't somebody testify
kick a hole right in the sky
testify testify kick a hole right in the sky
slap a liar in his eye
kick a hole right in the sky
testify testify kick a hole right in the sky

I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I wonder why
why
puts us in a pumpkin shell
where you keep us very well
it's hell
where I dwell
when history books are full of shit
I become the anarchist
I'm pissed at this
what this country claims to be
it's a lie
no place for me
I bleed

won't somebody testify
kick a hole right in the sky
testify testify kick a hole right in the sky
slap a liar in his eye
kick a hole right in the sky
testify testify kick a hole right in the sky

I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I decide
to defy
kill my trust if you must
but in my blood there is the lust
for life
that's right
apache blood is in my heart
thrashing though me like a shark
crashing though the dark

won't somebody testify
kick a hole right in the sky
testify testify kick a hole right in the sky
slap a liar in his eye
kick a hole right in the sky
testify testify kick a hole right in the sky

what am I supposed to do
I feel like I'm cut in two
confused by rules
do these cultures clash or am I living in the past
I ask
please tell me fast

won't somebody testify
kick a hole right in the sky
testify testify kick a hole right in the sky
slap a liar in his eye
kick a hole right in the sky
testify testify kick a hole right in the sky

to what do I belong and if I change will i be wrong
I took my foot and kicked
a hole in the sky
I proceeded to plead
fathers help me decide
a jagged flash of light struck me in the eye
I turned around and found that I was still alive
snakes rise high from the purple black sky
the red cloud rains and the black horse rides
then it dawned on my like the mornin sun
I'm a part of two worlds and the mornin comes
glowing embers tend to remember when
the power that is peace was treated as a friend
I am a master of and I've got to take action
I'm a man
the animal man
