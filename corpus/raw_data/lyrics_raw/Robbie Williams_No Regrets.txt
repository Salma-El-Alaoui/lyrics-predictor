Tell me a story
Where we all change
And we'd live our lives together
And not enstranged

I didn't lose my mind it was
Mine to give away
Couldn't stay to watch me cry
You didn't have the time
So I softly slip away...

No regrets they don't work
No regrets they only hurt
Sing me a love song
Drop me a line
Suppose it's just a point of view
But they tell me I'm doing fine

I know from the outside
(Some people said)
We looked good for eachother
Felt things were going wrong
When you didn't like my mother

I don't want to hate
But that's all you've left me with
A bitter aftertaste and a fantasy
Of how we all could live

No regrets they don't work
No regrets now, they only hurt
(We've been told you stay up late)
I know they're still talking
(You're far too short to carry weight)
The demons in your head
(Return the videos they're late)
If I could just stop hating you
(Goodbye)
I'd feel sorry for us instead

Remember the photographs insane
The ones where we all laugh so lame
We were having the time of our lives
Well thank you, it was a real blast

No regrets, they don't work
No regrets, they only hurt
(We've been told you stay up late)
Write me a love song
(You're far too short to carry weight)
Drop me a line
(Return the videos they're late)
Suppose it's just a point of view
(Goodbye)
But they tell me I'm doing fine

Everything I wanted to be
Everytime I walked away
Everytime you told me to leave
I just wanted to stay
Everytime you looked at me
And everytime you smiled
I felt so vacant you treat me like a child
I loved the way we used to laugh
I loved the way we used to smile
Often I sit down and think of you for a while
And then it passes me by
And I think of someone else instead
I guess the love we once had
Is officially
Dead!
