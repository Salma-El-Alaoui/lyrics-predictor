Somewhere, beyond the sea
Somewhere waiting for me...
My lover stands on golden sands
And watches the ships that go sailing

Somewhere, beyond the sea
She's there watching for me
If I could fly like birds on high
Then straight to her arms
I'll go sailing

It's far, beyond the stars
It's near, beyond the moon
I know... beyond a doubt
My heart will lead me there soon...

We'll meet, beyond the shore
We'll kiss just like before
Happy we will be beyond the sea
And never again, I'll go sailing


I know, beyond a doubt...
My heart... will lead me there soon

We'll meet, I know we'll meet, beyond the shore
We'll kiss just as before
Happy we will be beyond the sea...
And never again, I'll go sailing

No more sailing
So long, sailing, sailing
No more sailing

Goodbye, farewell, my friend
No more sailing
So long, sailin'
No more sailing

No more, farewell
Auf wiedersehen (to ya and ya and ya)

No more sailing
(No more) Oh, no more sailing

No more, no more
No more sailing...

No more
One more time

No more sailing...

Yeah
