Well, I just got back an' I wish I never leave now
(where'd ya go?)
Who dat Martian arrival at the airport yeah?
(where'd ya go?)
How many local dollars for a local anaesthetic?
(where'd ya go?)
The Johnny on the corner wasn't very sympathetic
(where'd ya go?)

''[Chorus:]''
I went to the place where every white face is an invitation to robbery
Sitting here in my safe European home
Don't wanna go back there again.

Wasn't lucky an' wouldn't it be loverly?
(where'd ya go?)
Send us all cards, an' have a laying in on a Sunday
(where'd ya go?)
I was there for two weeks, so how come I never tell now
(where'd ya go?)
That Natty Dread drinks at the Sheraton Hotel now
(where'd ya go?)

''[Chorus]''

They got the sun, an' they got the palm trees
(where'd ya go?)
They got the weed, an' they got the taxes
(where'd ya go?)
Whoa, The Harder They Come, an' the home of ol' bluebeat
(where'd ya go?)
I'd stay an' be a tourist but I can't take the gunplay
(where'd ya go?)

''[Chorus]''

Rudie come
From Jamaica
Cos Rudie can't fail
Cos Rudie come
From Jamaica
Rudie can't fail
Rudie come
From Jamaica
Cos Rudie can't fail
Cos Rudie come
From Jamaica
Rudie can't fail
Rudie, Rudie, Rudie, Rudie, Rudie
Rudie can't fail
Rudie, Rudie, Rudie, Rudie, Rudie
Rudie can't fail

Cos Rudie's went there
And Rudie's lived there
And Rudie come back, come back now

And Rudie, Rudie, Rudie, Rudie, Rudie
Come back, come on
now oh now

Rudie, Rudie, Rudie, Rudie, Rudie
Rudie can't fail

Rudie, Rudie, Rudie, Rudie
Rudie, you can't fail!

Rudie come on and Rudie come
And Rudie can't fail

Explosive!
(Rudie come on, Rudie, Rudie... Rudie can't fail...)
You're day at home
You try the fog train
(Rudie, Rudie, Rudie, Rudie.....)
(You're day at home, You try the fog train)
Rudie come back
And Rudie did
No else wants to be this way
