Where is the sun that shone on my head
The sun in my life, it is dead it is dead

Where is the light that would play on my street
And where are the friends
I could meet, I could meet

Where are the girls I left far behind
The spicks and the specks
Of the girls on my mind

Where is the sun that shone on my head
The sun in my life, it is dead it is dead

Where are the girls
I left far behind
The spicks and the specks
Of the girls on my mind

Where is the girl
I loved all along
The girl that I loved
She is gone, she is gone
All of my life
I call yesterday
The spicks and the specks
of my life've gone away

All of my life
I call yesterday
The spicks and the specks
of my life've gone away
(rpt whole section)

Everybody! (trumpet instr.)
Spicks and Specks, Spicks and Specks, oh......(fade out)
