Nowhere,
Yeah we're going nowhere- fast.
Maybe this time I'll be yours you'll be mine.
C-c-c-crazy!
Ah-Get your ass in my bed!
Baby you'll be, just my summer boyfriend (summerboy)

(Chorus)
Lets get lost you can take me home
Somewhere nice we can be alone
Bikini top's coming off
Don't be sad when the sun goes down
You'll wake up and I'm not around
I've got to go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
We'll still have the summer after all

Sometimes, you might start a fight.
But I'm happy pretending we're alright (alright)
Sun glasses cover up my green eyes
My martini glistens, yeah
While checking out other guys (summerboy)

Lets get lost you can take me home
Somewhere nice we can be alone
Bikini top's coming off
Don't be sad when the sun goes down
You'll wake up and I'm not around
I've got to go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
We'll still have the summer after all

Hey there summerboy
Let's go for a drive
Take me for a ride
Never gonna close our eyes

Hey there summerboy
I'm a busy girl
Don't got too much time
Hurry up before I change my mind

Hey there summerboy
I'm taking off my heels
Let's go for run
Have a little summer fun
Have a little summer fun
(summerboy)

Lets get lost you can take me home
Somewhere nice we can be alone
Bikini top's poppin' off
Don't be sad when the sun goes down
You'll wake up and I'm not around
You've got to go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
We'll still have the summer after-

Lets get lost you can take me home
Somewhere nice we can be alone
I‘ve got my summer-summerboy

Don't be sad when the sun goes down
You'll wake up and I'm not around
I've got my summer-summerboy

And we'll still have the summer after all

I've got my-
I've got my-
I've got my- summer summerboy
