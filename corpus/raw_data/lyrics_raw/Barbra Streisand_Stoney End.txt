I was born from love
And my poor mother worked the mines
I was raised on the good book, Jesus
Till I read between the lines
Now I don't believe I want to see the morning

Going down to Stoney End
I never wanted to go down to Stoney End
Mama, let me start all over
Cradle me, mama cradle me again

I can still remember him
With lovelight in his eyes
But the light flickered out and parted
As the sun began to rise
Now I don't believe I want to see the morning

Going down to Stoney End
I never wanted to go down to Stoney End
Mama, let me start all over
Cradle me, mama cradle me again
(Cradle me, mama cradle me again)
(Mama cradle me again)

Never mind the forecast
'Cause the sky has lost control
'Cause the fury and the broken thunder's
Come to match my raging soul
Now I don't believe I want to see the morning

Going down to Stoney End
I never wanted to go down to Stoney End
Mama, let me start all over
Cradle me, mama cradle me again

Going down to Stoney End
I never wanted to go, I never wanted to go
Going down to Stoney End
I never wanted to go, I never wanted to go
Going down to Stoney End
I never wanted to go, I never wanted to go
