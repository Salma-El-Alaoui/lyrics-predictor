Knew you'd be here tonight
So I put my best dress on
Boy I was so right
Our eyes connected
Now nothin's how it used to be
No second guesses
Trackin' on this feelin'
Pull focus close up you and me
Nobody's leavin'
Got me affected spun me 180 degrees
So electric

Chorus:
Slow down and dance with me, yeah
Slow
Skip a beat and move with my body, yeah
Slow
Come on and dance with me, yeah
Slow
Skip a beat and move with my body, yeah
Slow

Dont wanna rush it
Let the rhythmn pull you in
This will touch it
You know what Im sayin'
And I haven't said a thing
Keep the record playin

Chorus

Ohh

Read my body language
Take it down, down

Chorus
