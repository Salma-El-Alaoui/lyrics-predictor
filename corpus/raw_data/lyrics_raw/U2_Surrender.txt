Oh, the city's alight
With lovers and lies
And bright blue eyes

Oh, the city is bright
It's brighter than day tonight

(Surrender, surrender)
(Surrender, surrender)

Sadie said she couldn't work out what it was all about
And so she let go
Now Sadie's on the street and the people she meets you know

She tried to be a good girl and a good wife
Raise a good family
Lead a good life
It's not good enough
She got herself up on the 48th floor
Gotta find out
Find out what she's living for

(Surrender, surrender)
(Surrender, surrender)

Oh, the city's a fire
A passionate flame that knows me by name
Oh, the city's desire to take me for more and more
It's in the street gettin' under my feet
It's in the air, it's everywhere I look for you
It's in the things that I do and say
And it I wanna live I gotta die to myself someday

Oh, oh, oh, oh...

Papa sing my sing my song
Papa sing my sing my song
Papa sing my sing my song
