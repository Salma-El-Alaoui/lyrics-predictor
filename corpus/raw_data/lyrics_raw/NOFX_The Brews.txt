Friday night we'll be drinkin Maneshevitz
Goin out to terrorize goyim
Stompin shagitz, screwin shicksas
As long as we're home by Saturday mornin
Cause hey we're the brews
Sportin anti swastika tattoos
Oi Oi we're the boys
Orthodox, hasidic, OG Ois
Orthopedic Dr Martens good for
Waffle making, kickin through the shin
Reputation, gained through intimidation
Pacifism no longer tradition
Cause hey
We're the brews
Sportin anti swastika tattoos
Oi Oi we're the brews
The fairfax ghetto boys skinhead hebrews
We got the might, psycho meshuganas
We can't lose a fight,
As we are the chosen ones
Chutzpah driven, we battle then we feast
We celebrate, we'll separate our milkplates
From our meat
Oi Oi hey we're the brews
sportin anti swastika tattoos
Oi Oi we're the boys
Orthodox, hasidic, OG Ois

C'mon you schmucks
One more time for Hershel!
