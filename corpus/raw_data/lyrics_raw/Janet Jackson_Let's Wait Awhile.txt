Verse 1:
There's something I want to tell you
There's something I think that you should know
It's not that I shouldn't really love you
Let's take it slow
When we get to know each other
and we're both feeling much stronger
Then let's try to talk it over
Let's wait awhile longer

Chorus:
Let's wait awhile before it's too late
Let's wait awhile, our love will be great
Let's wait awhile before we go too far

Verse 2:
Remember that special night?
When all of the stars were shining bright
We made our first endeavor to stay together
We made our very first promise
To love, to share and be real honest


But on that very first night
It wasn't quite right

Chorus:
Let's wait awhile before it's too late
Let's wait awhile, our love will be great
Let's wait awhile before we go too far

I didn't really know not to let all my feelings show
to save some for later so our love will be greater
You said you would always love me
Remember I said the same thing too
You don't have to be frightened with my love
Because I'll never give up on you
Let's wait awhile, before it's too late
You know, you can't rush love
Let's just take our time
Love's so good - sure I'll love will be there
Slow it down
I promise, I'll be worth the wait.
