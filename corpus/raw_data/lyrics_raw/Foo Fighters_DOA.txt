Girl, you know I did it
It's over and I feel fine
Nothing you can say is gonna change my mind
Waited, and i waited the longest night
Nothing like the taste of sweet decline

I went down and i fell, i fell so fast
Dropping like the grains in an hour glass
Never say forever 'cause nothing lasts
Dancing with the bones of my buried past

Never mind there's nothing I could do
Bet your life there's something killing you.

It's a shame we have to die my dear
No-one's getting out of here alive
This time
What a way to go but have no fear
No-one's getting out of here alive
This time

I'm finished, i'm getting you off my chest
Made you come clean in a dirty dress
A promise is a promise you kept in check
Hard to cross a heart that beats its fist

Take a good hard look for the very last time
The very last one in a very long line.
Only took a second to say goodbye
Been a pleasure, but the pleasure's been mine all mine

(Bridge)

(chorus)

Ain't no way
D.O.A
Ain't no way
D.O.A

Take a good hard look for the very last time
The very last one in a very long line
Only took a second to say goodbye
Been a pleasure, but the pleasure's been mine all mine

(Bridge)

(Chorus)

It's a shame we have to disappear
No-one's getting out of here alive
This time
This time
This time
