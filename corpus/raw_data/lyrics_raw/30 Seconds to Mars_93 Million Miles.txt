Where does your garden grow?
Tell me the secrets that you know
Another time, another place
Where are the holy ones?
Selling the secret to the sun
Welcome to the Universe

Cross the line
Redefine
Lose your mind
Come crawl inside

Hey, hey
What've you got?
Doesn't matter to me 'cause I don't want them
I'm not the only one

The unified divide
Among and then deny
Now could you kindly cut to the chase?
It's like some other song
Pretty but something's always wrong
Show me the secret ancient sign

Cross the line
Redefine
Lose your mind
Come crawl inside

Hey, hey
What've you got?
Doesn't matter to me 'cause I don't want them
I'm not the only one

Hey, hey
What've you got?
Doesn't matter to me 'cause I don't want them
I'm not the only one

See
It's in your eyes
Come break me down
Come break me

Hey, hey
What've you got?
Doesn't matter to me 'cause I don't want them
I'm not the only one

Hey, hey
What've you got?
Doesn't matter to me 'cause I don't want them
I'm not the only one

Hey
What've you got?
