They came flying from far away
Now I'm under their spell
I love hearing the stories that they tell
 
They've seen places beyond my land
And they've found new horizons
They speak strangely but I understand
 
And I dream, I'm an eagle
And I dream, I can spread my wings
Flying high, high, I'm a bird in the sky
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
 
High, high, what a feeling to fly
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please
 
As all good friends, we talk all night
And we fly wing to wing
I have questions and they know everything
 
There's no limit to what I feel
We climb higher and higher
Am I dreaming or is it all real?
 
Is it true, I'm an eagle?
Is it true, I can spread my wings?
Flying high, high, I'm a bird in the sky
(I'm an eagle)
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
 
High, high, what a feeling to fly
(What a feeling)
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please
