Oh my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care
When he takes me in his arms
The world is bright, alright,
What's the difference if I say
I'll go away
When I know I'll come back
On my knees someday
Oh whatever my man is
I am his
Forever more
It cost me a lot
But that's one thing that I've got
It's my man
Cold and wet
Tired you bet
But all that I soon forget
With my man
He's not much for looks


And no hero out of books
He's my man
Two or three girls has he
That he likes as well as me
But I love him

Oh my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care
When he takes me in his arms
The world is bright, alright,
What's the difference if I say
I'll go away
When I know I'll come back
On my knees someday
Oh whatever my man is
I am his
Forever more
