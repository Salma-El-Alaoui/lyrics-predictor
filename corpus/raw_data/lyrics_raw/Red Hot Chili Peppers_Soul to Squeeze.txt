I've got a bad disease
But from my brain is where I bleed
Insanity it seems
Has got me by my soul to squeeze

Well all the love from thee
With all the dying trees I scream
The angels in my dreams (yeah)
Have turned to demons of greed that's mean

Where I go I just don't know
I got to got to gotta take it slow
When I find my peace of mind
I'm gonna give you some of my good time

Today love smiled on me
It took away my face, say please
I'll let your ride be free
You gotta let it be oh yeah

Where I go I just don't know
I got to gotta gotta take it slow
When I find my peace of mind
I'm gonna give you some of my good time

Oh so polite indeed
Well I've got everything I need
Oh make my days a breeze
And take away my self-destruction

It's bitter baby and its very sweet
I'm on a roller coaster
But I'm on my feet
Take me to the river lay me on your shore
I'll be comin' back baby
I'll be comin' back for more

Doo doo doo doo dingle zing a dong bone
Ba-di ba-da ba-soma coma con gone bad

Like an apple kiss
But I will not endeavor
Simple pleasures aren't much better
But I won't regret it never

Where I go I just don't know
I got to got to gotta take it slow
When I find my peace of mind
I'm gonna give you some of my good time

Where I go I just don't know
I might end up somewhere in Mexico
When I find my peace of mind
I'm gonna keep it for the end of time
