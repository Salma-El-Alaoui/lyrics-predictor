When I'm lost, in the rain,
In your eyes I know I'll find the light, to light my way.
When I'm scared, losing ground
When my world is going crazy, you can turn it all around. (yes)

And when I'm down you're there pushing me to the top.
You're always there giving me all you've got.

For a shield from the storm
For a friend, for a love
To keep me safe and warm,
I turn to you.
For the strength to be strong;
For the will to carry on;
For everything you do;
For everything that's true,
I turn to you. (oooo yeah)

When I lose the will to win,
I just reach to you and I can reach the sky again.
I can do anything,
'Cause your love is so amazing;
'Cause your love inspires me.

And when I need a friend, you're always on my side;
Giving me faith taking me through the night

For a shield (For a shield) from the storm; (from the storm)
For a friend; for a love (for a love to keep me safe and warm)
To keep me safe and warm,
I turn to you. (I turn to you)
For the strength (for the strength) to be strong;
For the will to carry on;
For everything you do;
I turn to you. (ooo yeah oohhh)

For the arms to be my shelter through all the rain;
For truth that will never change;
For someone to lean on;
For a heart I can rely on through anything;
For that one who I can run to;(oooooo) (I turn to you oooooo yeah)

For a shield from the storm;
For a friend; for a love (to keep me safe a warm yeah yeah, I turn to you)
To keep me safe and warm,
I turn to you. (I turn to you)
For the strength (for the strength) to be strong;
For the will to carry on;
For everything you do; (everything you do)
For everything that's true;

For everything you do;
For everything that's true,
I turn to you.
