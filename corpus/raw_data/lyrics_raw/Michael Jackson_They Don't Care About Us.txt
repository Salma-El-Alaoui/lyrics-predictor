Bang bang
Shock dead

All I wanna say is that

All I wanna say is that

You can never break me
Will me
Thrill me
You can never kill me

Everybody do me
Kick me
Kike me
Don't you black or white me

All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us

Tell me what has become of my life
I have a wife and two children who love me
I'm a victim of police brutality, now
I'm tired of bein' the victim of hate,
Your rapin' me of my pride
Oh for God's sake
I look to heaven to fulfill its prophecy...
Set me free

Tell me what has become of my rights
Am I invisible 'cause you ignore me?
Your proclamation promised me free liberty, now.
I'm tired of bein' the victim of shame
They're throwin' me in a class with a bad name
I can't believe this is the land from which I came
You know I really do hate to say it
The government don't wanna see
But if Roosevelt was livin', he wouldn't let this be, no no.

He wouldn't let this be, no no.
