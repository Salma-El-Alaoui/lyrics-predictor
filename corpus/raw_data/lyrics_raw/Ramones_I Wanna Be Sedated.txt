Twenty-twenty-twenty-four hours to go
I wanna be sedated
Nothing to do, nowhere to go home,
I wanna be sedated

Just, get me to the airport, put me on a plane
Hurry hurry hurry, before I go insane
I can't control my fingers, I can't control my brain
Oh no oh-oh oh-oh


Twenty-twenty twenty-four hours to go
I wanna be sedated
Nothing to do, nowhere to go home,
I wanna be sedated

Just put me in a wheelchair, get me on a plane
Hurry hurry hurry, before I go insane
I can't control my fingers, I can't control my brain
Oh no oh-oh oh-oh


Twenty-twenty-twenty-four hours to go
I wanna be sedated
Nothing to do, nowhere to go home,
I wanna be sedated

Just put me in a wheelchair and get me to the show
Hurry hurry hurry, before I gonna go
I can't control my fingers, I can't control my toes
Oh no oh-oh oh-oh


Twenty-twenty-twenty-four hours to go
I wanna be sedated
Nothing to do, nowhere to go home,
I wanna be sedated

Just put me in a wheelchair, get me to the show
Hurry hurry hurry, before I gonna go
I can't control my fingers, I can't control my toes
Oh no oh-oh oh-oh

Ba-ba-baba baba-ba-baba, I wanna be sedated
Ba-ba-baba baba-ba-baba, I wanna be sedated
Ba-ba-baba baba-ba-baba, I wanna be sedated
Ba-ba-baba baba-ba-baba, I wanna be sedated
