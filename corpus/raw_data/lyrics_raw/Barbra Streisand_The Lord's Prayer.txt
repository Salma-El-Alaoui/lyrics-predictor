Our father
Which art in heaven
Hallowed be thy name
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done
In earth as it is
In heaven...
(give us this day our daily bread)
And forgive our debts


As we forgive our debtors
And lead us not into temptation
But deliver us from evil
For thine is the kingdom
And the power
And the glory
Forever...
Amen...
