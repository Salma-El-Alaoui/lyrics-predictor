I know that things are getting tougher
When you can't get the top off
The bottom of the barrel
Wide open road of my future now...
Is fucking, fucking narrow

All I know is that I don't know
All I know is that I don't know nothing

We get told to decide
Just like as if
I'm not gonna to change my mind

Whatcha gonna do with yourself
Boy better make up your mind
Whatcha gonna do with yourself
You're running out of time

All I know is that I don't know
All I know is that I don't know nothing
And that's fine
