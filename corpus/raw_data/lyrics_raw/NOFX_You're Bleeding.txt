You've got the beauty, but that don't mean a thing

A bland reciprocation, but that dosen't bother me

You're happier with lights on underneath a darkened sky

Only in the spotlight can you tell me of your crimes

I understand the situation, but I can't

Seem to understand the motivations you once had

I recall a message I once left behind a screen

I was entranced, when you were never there for me

You're draining, you're draining me, I'm not a tub

What ever happened to the girl I used to hold?

I held in such a high regard

Where is the girl who had it all?

I used to think I wasn't worthy of your cause

I used to feel so lucky

Until the day I felt a weakness in my arms

I knew from where it had been coming

You're bleeding, you're bleeding me, I can recall

The passions you once had, where did they go?

I knew a girl who had it all?

I knew a girl where did she go?
