I work all night I work all day to pay the bills I have to pay
ain't it sad
and still there never seems to be a single penny left for me
that's too bad
in my dreams
I have a plan
if I got me a wealthy man
I wouldn't have to work at all I'd fool around and have a ball

(chorus)
money money money
must be funny
in the rich man's world
money money money
always sunny
in the rich man's world
ahaaa
all the things I could do
if I had a little money
it's a rich man's world

it's a rich man's world

a man like that is hard to find but I can't get him off my mind
ain't it sad
and if he happens to be free I bet he wouldn't fancy me
that's too bad
so I must leave
I'll have to go
to Las Vegas or Monaco
and win a fortune in a game my life would never be the same

(chorus x2)

it's a rich man's world
