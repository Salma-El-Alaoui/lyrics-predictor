INTRO:
Ooh yeah
Now word is out
The word is out
Innocence
Word is out
Over town

Now the word is out
Word is out
Now the word is out
The word is out

1:
You're clinging to a lie
Still you hope to try
And save your face, ooh
It's a no-win situation
There ain't gonna be a saving grace

Because you're sticking to a story
It really makes no sense
No judge or jury could ignore the evidence

CHORUS:
Because the word is out
I can't go on believing in your innocence
Now the word is out (the word is out)
The word is out
You can't go on pretending
It's all over town
Now the word is out (the word is out)

2:
Ain't but one redeeming feature
So you may as well accept your fate
(Accept your fate), ooh
You can't wriggle out of this, it's gone too far
It's much too late (it's much too late)

But it's funny my suspicions lead me to the lie
From the friend of a so-called friend
I heard about your double life

CHORUS:

Ooh yeah
Because the word is out
Can't go on pretending
Innocence
The word is out
The word is out
Yeah
Over town
Now the word is out (the word is out)
It's all over town

CHORUS:
(repeat & fade)
