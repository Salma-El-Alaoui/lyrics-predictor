I knew a girl named Nikki, I guess U could say she was a sex fiend
I met her in a hotel lobby masturbating with a magazine
She said, “How'd U like 2 waste some time”
And I could not resist when I saw little Nikki grind

She took me 2 her castle and I just couldn't believe my eyes
She had so many devices, everything that money could buy
She said, “Sign your name on the dotted line”
The lights went out and Nikki started 2 grind

Ow, Nikki!

The castle started spinning or maybe it was my brain
I can't tell U what she did 2 me, but me body will never be the same
Her lovin' will kick your behind, oh, she'll show U no mercy
But she'll sho'nuff, sho'nuff show U how 2 grind

Darlin' Nikki, oh!

I woke up the next morning, Nikki wasn't there
I looked all over, all I found was a phone number on the stairs
It said, “Thank U 4 a funky time
Call me up whenever U wanna grind”

Yeah, Nikki, oh!
Oh, come back Nikki, come back!
Your dirty little Prince wanna grind, grind, grind
