I'm diggin' my way
I'm diggin' my way to somethin'
I'm diggin' my way to somethin' better

I'm pushin' to stay
I'm pushin' to stay with somethin'
I'm pushin' to stay with somethin' better

I'm sowing the seeds
I'm sowing the seeds I take
I'm sowing the seeds I take for granted

This thorn in my side
This thorn in my side is from the tree
This thorn in my side is from the tree I've planted
It tears me and I bleed
And I bleed

Caught under wheels roll
I take that leech I'm bleeding me
Can't stop to save my soul
I take the leash that's leading me
I'm bleeding me
I can't take it
Caught under wheels roll
Oh, the bleeding of me
Of me
The bleeding of me

Caught under wheels roll
I take that leech
I'm bleeding me
Can't stop to save my soul
I take the leash that's leading me
I'm bleeding me
I can't take it
Caught under wheels roll
Oh, the bleeding of me
Oh, the bleeding of me

I am the beast that bleeds the feast
I am the blood
I am release

Come make me pure
Bleed me a cure
I'm caught, I'm caught, I'm caught under
Caught under wheels roll
I take that leech
I'm bleeding me
Can't stop to save my soul
I take the leash that's leading me
I'm bleeding me
I can't take it
I can't take it
I can't take it
Oh, the bleeding of me

I'm diggin' my way
I'm diggin' my way to somethin'
I'm diggin' my way to somethin' better

I'm pushin' to stay
I'm pushin' to stay with somethin'
I'm pushin' to stay with somethin' better
With somethin' better
