Boogie - ah, you sexy, sexy (boogie child)
Boogie - the situation wrecks me
Boogie - I cant stand the way you do it (boogie child)
Boogie - bad girl dont put me through it
Boogie - right to the limit (boogie child)
Boogie - youre a bad girl you got me in it
Boogie - a man could die for the way Im thinking (boogie child)
Boogie - and Im in too deep and I just keep sinking

When you move it like you really know how to move me
I follow you wherever you go
I just wanna lay my love on you -- that boogie child she can
Boogie - oh, you sexy, sexy (boogie child)

You cant touch her cos you know shes mine
Come on boogie child let your love-light shine
I just wanna lay my love on you -- that boogie child she can

Boogie - ah, you sexy, sexy (boogie child)
Boogie - the situation wrecks me
Boogie - I canï¿½t stand the way you do it (boogie child)
Boogie - bad girl dont put me through it
You cant touch her cos you know shes mine
Come on boogie child let your love light shine
I just wanna lay my love on you - that boogie child she can

Boogie - oh, you sexy, sexy (boogie child)
Boogie - the situation wrecks me
Boogie - I cant stand the way you do it (boogie child)
Boogie - bad girl dont put me through it
