Could be?
Who knows?
There's something due any day
I will know, right away
Soon as it shows
It may come connanballing down
Through the sky
Gleam in it's eye, bright as rose
Who knows?
It's only just out of reach
Down the block, on the beach
Under a tree
I got a feeling there's a miracle due
Gonna come true, comin' to me...
Could it be, yes it could
Something's comin', something good
If I can wait
Something's comin'
I don't know what it is
But it is gonna be great
With a click, with a shock
Phone'll jingle, door will knock
Open the latch
Something's comin'
Don't know when


But it's soon
Catch the moon
One handed catch
Around the corner
Or whistlin' down the river
Come on, deliver to me
Will it be, yes it will
Maybe just by holding still
It'll be there
Come on, something
Come on in
Don't be shy
Meet a guy
Pull up a chair
The air is humming
And something great is coming
I feel like drumming
And something great is coming
Who knows?
It's only just out of reach
Down the block, on a beach
Maybe tonight...
Maybe tonight...
Maybe tonight...!
