I'm buried up to my neck in
Contradictorary flies
I'll take pride as the king of literature
I'm very ape
And very nice

If you ever need anything
Please don't
Hesitate to ask someone else first
I'm to busy acting like I'm not naive
I've seen it all
I was here first

Out of the ground
Into the sky
Out of the sky
Into the dirt

If you ever need anything
Please don't
Hesitate to ask someone else first
I'm to busy acting like I'm not naive
I've seen it all
I was here first

Out of the ground
Into the sky
Out of the sky
Into the ground

Out of the ground
Into the sky
Out of the sky
Into the dirt
