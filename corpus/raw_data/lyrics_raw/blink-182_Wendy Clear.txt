Let's take the boat out on the bay
Forget your job for just one day
I wish it didn't have to be so bad
It might be inappropriate, because
Either way, our band gets dropped, oh yeah
I wish it didn't have to be so bad

But I'd play with fire to break the ice
And I'd play with a nuclear device
Is it something I'll regret
Why do I want what I can't get
I wish it didn't have to be so bad

The 3 date theory's getting old
Everyone's getting left out in the cold
I wish it didn't have to be so bad
So I'll see you with another guy
Who pretends not to hear you when you cry, oh yeah
I wish it didn't have to be so bad

But I'd play with fire to break the ice
And I'd play with a nuclear device
Is it something I'll regret
Why do I want what I can't get
I wish it didn't have to be so bad

I'll be moving on, moving on, moving on and on
Moving on, moving on, moving on and on and on

But I'd play with fire to break the ice
And I'd play with a nuclear device
Is it something I'll regret
Why do I want what I can't get
I wish it didn't have to be so bad
