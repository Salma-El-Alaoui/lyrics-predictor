At first flash of Eden, We race down to the sea.
Standing there on freedom's shore.

Waiting for the sun. Waiting for the sun. Waiting for the
sun.

Can you feel it, now that spring has come?
That it's time to live In the scattered sun.

Waiting for the sun. Waiting for the sun. Waiting for the
sun.
Waiting for the sun.
Waiting...

Waiting for you to
Come along.

Waiting for you to
Hear my song.

Waiting for you to come along.
Waiting for you to Tell me what went wrong.

This is the strangest life I've ever known.

Can't you feel it, now that spring has come?
That it's time to live In the scattered sun.

Waiting for the sun. Waiting for the sun. Waiting for the
sun. Waiting for the sun
