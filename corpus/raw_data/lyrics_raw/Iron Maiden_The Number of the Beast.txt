I left alone, my mind was blank.
I needed time to think to get the memories from my mind.

What did I see, can I believe,
That what I saw that night was real
and not just fantasy.

Just what I saw, in my old dreams,
Were they reflections of my warped mind
staring back at me.

'Cause in my dreams, it's always there,
The evil face that twists my mind and brings
me to despair.
Yeah!!!

The night was black, was no use holding back,
'Cause I just had to see, was someone
watching me.
In the mist, dark figures move and twist,
Was all this for real, or just some kind of hell.
666 the Number of the Beast.
Hell and fire was spawned to be released.

Torches blazed and sacred chants were phrased,
As they start to cry, hands held to the sky.
In the night, the fires burning bright,
The ritual has begun, Satan's work is done.
666 the number of the beast.
Sacrifice is going on tonight.

This can't go on, I must inform the lord.
Can this still be real or just some crazy dream.
But I feel drawn towards the chanting hordes,
They seem to mesmerize...can't avoid their eyes,
666 the Number of the Beast.
666 the one for you and me.

I'm coming back, I will return,
And I'll possess your body and I'll make you burn.
I have the fire, I have the force.
I have the power to make my evil take it's course.
