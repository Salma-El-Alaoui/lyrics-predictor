Crazy

Oh, oh

Baby, I'm so into you
You've got that something, what can I do
Baby, you spin me around, oh
The earth is movin', but I can't feel the ground
Every time you look at me
My heart is jumpin, it's easy to see

You drive me crazy, I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep (oh-oh-oh)
Crazy, but it feels alright
Baby thinking of you keeps me up all night

Tell me... you're so into me
That I'm the only one you will see
Tell me... I'm not in the blue, oh
That I'm not wastin my feelings on you
Every time I look at you
My heart is jumpin, what can I do

You drive me crazy, I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep (oh-oh-oh)
Crazy, but it feels alright
Baby thinking of you keeps me up all night

Oh (ooh, yeah-yeah)
(you drive me crazy) (oh) Sing it!

Yeah-yeah-yeah

Stop!

(Oooh, oh, yeah)
You drive me crazy, baby
Get excited, I'm in too deep (oh-oh-oh)
Oh but it feels alright
Baby thinking of you keeps me up all night

You drive me crazy... (I just can't sleep)

Crazy (Oh) but it feels alright
Baby thinkin' of you keeps me up all night

You drive me crazy, but it feels alright
Baby thinkin' of you keeps me up all night
