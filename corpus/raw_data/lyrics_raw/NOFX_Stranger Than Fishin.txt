Got a no string guitar
Got a sun bathed head
I'm a rock n' roll star

I ain't no musician
Some things are stranger than fishin'

Know how to beat on a drum
Know how to sing out of key
Got some prescription drugs

I ain't no musician
Some things are stranger then fishin'

Yeah I know what I am chop up another gram
Some of us have all the luck
No matter how much we fucking suck
