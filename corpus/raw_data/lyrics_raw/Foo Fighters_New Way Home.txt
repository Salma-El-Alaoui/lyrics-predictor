Have you found your way around the down and out?
I know it must seem long, so long
I'm still trying to keep this time from running out
Head down, always moving on and on and on

I never heard this warning
Another early morning takes me, wakes me into
If you could manage me
I'll try to manage you
But lately it's all I ever do

CHORUS
I felt like this on my way home
I'm not scared
I pass the boats and the Kingdome
I'm not scared

I'll never tell you the secrets I'm holding
I know these things must bore you
But I can't find another way
I'll never tell you the secrets I'm holding
I love this leash that holds me
When I try to run away

REPEAT CHORUS (8X)

I'm not scared
