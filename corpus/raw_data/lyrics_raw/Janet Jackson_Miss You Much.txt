Shot, like an arrow through my heart
That's the pain I feel
I feel whenever we're apart
Not to say that I'm in love with you
But who's to say that I'm not
I just know that it feels wrong
When I'm away too long
It makes my body hot
So let me tell ya baby

I'll tell your mama, I'll tell your friends
I'll tell anyone whose heart can comprehend
Send it in a letter baby, tell you on the phone
I'm not the kinda girl who likes to be alone

I miss ya much (boy, oh, I, miss you much)
I really miss you much (M, I, S, S you much)
I miss ya much (boy, oh, I, miss you much)
I really miss you much (M, I, S, S you much)

I'm rushing home, just as soon as I can
I'm rushing home to see your smiling face
And feel your warm embrace
It makes feel so g-g-good
So I'll tell you baby

I'll tell your mama, I'll tell your friends
I'll tell anyone whose heart can comprehend
Send it in a letter baby, tell you on the phone
I'm not the kinda girl who likes to be alone

I miss ya much (boy, oh, I, miss you much)
I really miss you much (M, I, S, S you much)
I miss ya much (boy, oh, I, miss you much)
I really miss you much (M, I, S, S you much)

I miss ya much (boy, oh, I, miss you much)
I really miss you much (M, I, S, S you much)
I miss ya much (boy, oh, I, miss you much)
I really miss you much (M, I, S, S you much)


Miss you much, I miss you much
I really, really miss you
Miss you much, I miss you much

I brought you hear
To tell the world
I miss you

I'll tell your mama, I'll tell your friends
I'll tell anyone whose heart can comprehend, baby
Send it in a letter baby, tell you on the phone
I'm not the kinda girl who likes to be alone

I miss ya much (boy, oh, I, miss you much)
I really miss you much (M, I, S, S you much)
I miss ya much (boy, oh, I, miss you much)
I really miss you much (M, I, S, S you much)

I miss ya much (boy, oh, I, miss you much)
I really miss you much (M, I, S, S you much)
I miss ya much (boy, oh, I, miss you much)
I really miss you much (M, I, S, S you much)

That's the end?
