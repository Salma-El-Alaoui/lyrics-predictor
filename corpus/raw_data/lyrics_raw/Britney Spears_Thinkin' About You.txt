ah, ah ah
ah, ah ah

They say
I'm away
Because I'm down with you everyday
They say
Break away
I'm missing out on the fun and games

But you smile
And the words they tell me
Quickly disappear
You speak and there is no other
Voice that I can hear

(Chorus)
I spend my days (oh, oh) (all day all night)
With you
I spend my nights (My nights)
Thinkin' about you (2x)

You stepped on
On my mind
And I think about you
All the time
Day and night
Feels so right
And for us there is no end in sight

Each day that I spend around you
Passes by too fast
Each night
That I spend without you
Is longer than the last

Chorus

Ohh,
You know I can't get enough of you
(can't get enough yeah) (Uh, Uh)
You know that twenty-four hours won't ever ever do

(Chorus)(5x's)
