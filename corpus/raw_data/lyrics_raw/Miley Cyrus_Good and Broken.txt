Are you overloaded
Can't decode it
Your life's imploded now
There's a risk worth taking
A pain worth aching
On this hollow ground (we can)
Let go
Don't hold on to all of life's hardest parts
When we think of stoppin
Let's keep on rockin'
To the rhythm of our hearts

We can, We can
Break outta here
Jump on over there
Where the air is clearer
We can, We can
Forget the pace
Win in our own race
Become a broken chain, yeah
We are broken chains, yeah
Good and Broken

Find the magic
Go and grab it
Your fate is in your hands
Come on, find a reason to believe in
Just tell yourself
We can

We can, We can
Break outta here
Jump on over there
Where the air is clearer
We can, We can
Forget the pace
Win in our own race
Become a broken chain, yeah
We are broken chains, yeah
Good and Broken

Get off your seat
On your feet
Raise your hands
Feel the beat
Let it go
Lose control
Feel it in your soul
Don't you know what you can do
If you have faith in you
Let's not be invisible
There's no red light in life
Just go

We can, We can
Break outta here
Jump on over there
Where the air is clearer
We can, We can
Forget the pace
Win in our own race
Become a broken chain, yeah
We are broken chains, yeah
Good and Broken, yeah

Oh we can
Oh we can
Oh we can
Oh we can
Oh we can

Oh we can
Oh we can
Oh we can
Oh we can
Oh we can

Oh we can
Oh we can
Oh we can
Oh we can
Oh we can

Good and Broken
