We're a happy family
we're a happy family
we're a happy family
me mom and daddy

We're a happy family
we're a happy family
we're a happy family
me mom and daddy

Sitting here in Queens
eating refried beans
we're in all the magazines
gulpin' down thorazines
we ain't got no friends
our troubles never end
no Christmas cards to send
Daddy likes men

Daddy's telling lies
baby's eating flies
mommy's on pills
baby's got the chills
I'm friends with the president
I'm friends with the pope
we're all making a fortune
selling daddy's dope

Sitting here in Queens
eating refried beans
we're in all the magazines
gulpin' down thorazines
we ain't got no friends
our troubles never end
no Christmas cards to send
Daddy likes men

We're a happy family
we're a happy family
we're a happy family
me mom and daddy

We're a happy family
we're a happy family
we're a happy family
me mom and daddy...
