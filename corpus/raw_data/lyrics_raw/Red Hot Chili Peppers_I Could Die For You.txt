Something inside the cards I know is right
Don't wanna live somebody else's life
This is what I want to be
And this is what I give to you
Because I get it free
She smiles while I do my time

I could die for you
Oh this life I choose

I'm here to be your only go-between
To tell you of the sights these eyes have seen
What I really want to do, is turn it into motion
Beauty that I can't abuse.
You know that I use my senses to
You can see that it's only everywhere
I'd take it all and then I'd find a way to share
Come along and go along with me
Wander with me yo
It's all for free

I could die for you
What you wanna do
Oh this life I choose
I could die for you,
What you wanna do
Oh this life I choose

Come again and tell me where you wanna go
What it means for me to be with you alone
Close the door and no-one has to know
How we are

Come along and go along with me
Wander with me yo
It's all for free

I could die for you
What you wanna do
Oh this life I choose
