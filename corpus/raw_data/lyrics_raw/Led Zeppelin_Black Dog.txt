Hey, hey, mama, said the way you move
Gonna make you sweat
Gonna make you groove

Ah, ah, child, way you shake that thing
Gonna make you burn
Gonna make you sting

Hey, hey, baby, when you walk that way
Watch your honey drip
Can't keep away

Oh yeah, oh yeah, ah, ah, ah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, ah, ah, ah

I gotta roll, can't stand still
Got a flamin' heart, can't get my fill

Eyes that shine, burnin' red
Dreams of you all through my head

Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah, ah ah, ah ah, ah ah, ahhh

Hey baby, whoa baby, pretty baby
Darlin' makes 'em do me now
Hey baby, oh baby, pretty baby
Move me like you're doin' now

Didn't take too long 'fore I found out
What people mean by down and out

Spent my money, took my car
Started tellin' her friends she gonna be a star

I don't know, but I been told
A big-legged woman ain't got no soul

Oh yeah, oh yeah, ah, ah, ah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, ah, ah, ah

All I ask for, all I pray
A steady rollin' woman gonna come my way

Need a woman gonna hold my hand
Won't tell me no lies, make me a happy man

Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah, ah ah, ah ah, ah ah, ahhh
