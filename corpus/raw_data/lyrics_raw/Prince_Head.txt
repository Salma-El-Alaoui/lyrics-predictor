Head
Prince

Remember when I met you, Baby,
You were on your way to be wed.
You were such a sexy thing,
I loved the way you walked, the things you said.

I was so nonchalant.
I didn't want you to be misled.
But I got to have you, Baby.
I got to have you in my bed.

You said, "I'm just a virgin and I'm
On my way to be wed.
But you're such a hunk,
So full of spunk,
I'll give you"

Head. Til you're burning up.
Head. Til you get enough.
Head. Til your love is red.
Head. Love you til you're dead.

You know you're good, girl.
I think you like to go down.
You wouldn't have stopped but
I came, on getting down.

You said, "I must confess
I want to get undressed
And go to bed."
With that, I changed.
You fool, you married me instead.
Now, morning, noon, and night I give you

Head. Til you're burning up.
Head. Til you get enough.
Head. Til your love is red.
Head. Love you til you're dead.

Ahhh!

Oooh yeah. Oooh yeah. Oooh yeah.

Head. Head. Head. Head.

Oooh. Ahhh!

[musical interlude]

Head. Til you're burning up.
Head. Til you get enough.
Head. Til your love is red.
Head. Love you til you're dead.

I know.
Head. Head.
I know.
Head. Baby, Baby, Head. Oooh.
Head. Oooh. Head. Ooooh.
Head. You just said I could. Head. I'm good.
Head.
