''{spoken} Oh my God! What a fabulous room! Are all these your guitars?
[Film in background: I'm sorry sir, I didn't mean to startle you!]
This place is bigger than our apartment!
[Film: Let me know when you're entering a room
Yes sir!]
erm, Can I get a drink of water?
[Film: I was wondering about ...]
You want some, huh?
[Film: Yes]
Oh wow, look at this tub? Do you wanna take baaaath?
[Film: I'll have to find out from Mrs. Bancroft what time she wants to meet us, for her main ...]
What are you watching?
[Film: If you'll just let me know as soon as you can ... Mrs Bancroft... Mrs Bancroft ...]
Hello?
[Film: I don't understand ...]
Are you feeling okay?''

Day after day, love turns grey
Like the skin on a dying man
And night after night
We pretend it's all right
But I have grown older
And you have grown colder
And nothing is very much fun anymore
And I can feel
One of my turns coming on
I feel cold as a razor blade
Tight as a tourniquet
Dry as a funeral drum

Run to the bedroom
In the suitcase on the left
You'll find my favorite axe
Don't look so frightened
This is just a passing phase
One of my bad days
Would you like to watch TV?
Or get between the sheets?
Or contemplate the silent freeway?
Would you like something to eat?
Would you like to learn to fly? -- Would you?
Would you like to see me try?

Would you like to call the cops?
Do you think it's time I stopped?
Why are you running away?
