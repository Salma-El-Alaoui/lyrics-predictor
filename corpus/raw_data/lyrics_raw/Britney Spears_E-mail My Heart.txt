Forever...

It's been hours
seems like days
since you went away
and all I do is check the screen
to see if you're okay
you don't answer when I phone
guess you wanna be left alone
so I'm sending you my heart my soul
and this is what I'll say

(CHORUS 1)
I'm sorry(baby oh oh)
oh so sorry
can't you give me one more chance
to make it all up to you

(CHORUS 2)
E-mail my heart(oh yea)
and say our love will never die (and I)
I know you're out there
and I know that you still care (I know you care)
e-mail me back and say our love will stay alive
Forever...e-mail my heart

I can see you in my mind
coming on the line
and opening this letter
that I've sent a hundred times
here's a picture of us two (us two)
I look so good on you (on you)
and can't you please forgive me
for the hurt I put you through(ohoh

(CHORUS 1 and 2 2X)

Forever...e-mail my
forever...e-mail my heart
