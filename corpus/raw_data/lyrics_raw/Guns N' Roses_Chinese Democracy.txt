It don't really matter
You'll find out for yourself
No it don't really matter
You're gonna leave these thing to
Somebody else

If they were missionaries
Real time visionaries
Sitting in a Chinese stew
To view my dis-infatu-ation
I know that I'm a classic case
Watch my disenchanted face
Blame it on the Falun Gong
They've seen the end and you can't hold on now

Cause it would take a lot more hate than you
To end the fascination
Even with an iron fist
Our baby got to rule the nation
But all I got is precious time

It don't really matter
Yes I'll keep it to myself
Said it don't really matter
This time I look around for
Somebody else

Cause it would take a lot more time than you
Have got for masturbation
Even with your iron fist
Our baby got to rule the nation but all we've got is
Precious time
Our baby got to fool the nation but all I got is
Precious time

It don't really matter
I guess you'll find out for yourself
No it don't really matter
So you can hear it now from
Somebody else

You think you got it all locked up inside
And if you beat them all up they'll die
Then you'll walk them home for the cells
Then now you'll dig for your road back to hell
And with your ? makes you stop
As if your eyes were their eyes you can tell
In your lack of time
