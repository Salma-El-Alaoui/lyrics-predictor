Do the worm on Acropolis
Slamdance the Cosmopolis
Enlighteen the populace

Hungry darkness of living
Who will thirst in the pit
Hooked in Metropolis
She spent a lifetime deciding
How to run from it
Addicts of Metropolis
Once fate had a witness
And the years seemed like friends
Girlfriend
Her babies can dream
But dreams begin like the end
Shot into eternity
Methadone kitty
Iron serenity

Ghetto Defendant
It is heroin pity
Not tear gas nor baton charge
That stops you taking the city
Strung out committee

Walled out of the city
Clubbed down from uptown
Sprayed pest from the nest
Run out to Barrio Town
The guards are itchy
Forced to watch at the feast
Then sweep up the night
Flipped pieces of coin
Broken bottles
Exchanged for birthright
Graphed in a jiffy
Strung out committee
Sitting pretty
Graphed in a jiffy
No pity, pretty

The ghetto Prince of gutter poets
Was bounced out of the room
Jean Arthur Rimbaud
By the bodyguards of greed
For disturbing the tomb
1873
His words like flamthrowers
Paris Commune
Burnt the ghettos in their chests
His face painted whiter
And he was laid to rest
Died in Marseille
Buried in Charleville
Shut Up

Soap floods oil in water
All churn in the wake
On the great ship of progress
The crew can't find the brake
Klaxons are blaring
The admiral snores command
Submarines boil in oceans
While the armies fight with suns
