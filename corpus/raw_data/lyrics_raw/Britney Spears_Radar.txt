Confidence is a must, cockiness is a plus
Edginess is a rush
Edges, I like 'em rough
A man with a Midas touch
Intoxicate me, I'm a lush
Stop, you're making me blush
People are looking at us

I don't think you know (know)
I'm checking you, so hot, so hot
Wonder if ya know you're on my radar (on my radar)
On my radar (on my radar)
And yep, I notice you. I know it's you
I'm choosy, don't wanna lose you
You're on my radar (on my radar)
On my radar (on my radar)

And when you walk (when you walk)
And when you talk (when you talk)
I get the tingle, I wanna mingle
That's what I want (that's what I want)
Hey, listen, baby, turn up the fader
Trynna make you understand you're on my radar (on my radar)
On my radar (on my radar)

On my radar
Got you on my radar
Got you on my radar
Got you on my radar

Interesting sense of style, ten million dollar smile
Think I can handle that? Animal in the sack
His eyes see right to my soul, I surrender self-control
Catch me looking again, falling right into my plan

I don't think you know (know)
I'm checking you, so hot, so hot
Wonder if ya know you're on my radar (on my radar)
On my radar (on my radar)
And yep, I notice you. I know it's you
I'm choosy, don't wanna lose you
You're on my radar (on my radar)
On my radar (on my radar)

And when you walk (when you walk)
And when you talk (when you talk)
I get the tingle, I wanna mingle
That's what I want (that's what I want)
Hey, listen, baby, turn up the fader
Trynna make you understand you're on my radar (on my radar)

''I got my eye on you and I can't let you get away''

Hey, baby
Whether it's now or later, I got you
You can't shake me (no)
'Cause I got you on my radar
Whether you like it or not, it ain't gonna stop
'Cause I got you on my radar (I got you)
