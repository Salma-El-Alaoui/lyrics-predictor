You change your mind 
Like a girl changes clothes 
Yeah you, PMS 
Like a bitch 
I would know 

And you always think 
Always speak 
critically

I should know 
That you're no good for me 

Cause you're hot then you're cold 
You're yes then you're no 
You're in and you're out 
You're up and you're down 
You're wrong when it's right 
It's black and it's white 
We fight, we break up 
We kiss, we make up

You, You don't really want to stay, no 
You, but you don't really want to go-o 
You're hot then you're cold 
You're yes then you're no 
You're in and you're out 
You're up and you're down 

We used to be 
Just like twins 
So in sync 
The same energy 
Now's a dead battery 
Used to laugh bout nothing 
Now your plain boring 

I should know that 
you're not gonna change 

Cause you're hot then you're cold 
You're yes then you're no 
You're in and you're out 
You're up and you're down 
You're wrong when it's right 
It's black and it's white 
We fight, we break up 
We kiss, we make up

You, You don't really want to stay, no 
You, but you don't really want to go-o 
You're hot then you're cold 
You're yes then you're no 
You're in and you're out 
You're up and you're down 

Someone call the doctor 
Got a case of a love bi-polar 
Stuck on a roller coaster 
Can't get off this ride 

You change your mind 
Like a girl changes clothes 

Cause you're hot then you're cold 
You're yes then you're no 
You're in and you're out 
You're up and you're down 
You're wrong when it's right 
It's black and it's white 
We fight, we break up 
We kiss, we make up

You're hot then you're cold 
You're yes then you're no 
You're in and you're out 
You're up and you're down 
You're wrong when it's right 
It's black and it's white 
We fight, we break up 
We kiss, we make up

You, you don't really want to stay, no 
You, but you don't really want to go-o 
You're hot then you're cold 
You're yes then you're no 
You're in and you're out 
You're up and you're down
