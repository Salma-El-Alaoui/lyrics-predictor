where are those happy days they seem so hard to find
I try to reach for you but you have closed your mind
whatever happened to our love
I wish I understood
it used to be so nice, it used to be so good

so when you're near me darling can't you hear me, SOS
the love you gave me nothing else can save me, SOS
when you're gone
how can I even try to go on
when you're gone
though I try how can I carry on

you seem so far away though you were standing near
you made me feel alive but something died I fear
I really tried to make it up
I wish I understood
what happened to our love, it used to be so good

so when you're near me darling can't you hear me, SOS
the love you gave me nothing else can save me, SOS
when you're gone
how can I even try to go on
when you're gone
though I try how can I carry on

so when you're near me darling can't you hear me, SOS
the love you gave me nothing else can save me, SOS
when you're gone
how can I even try to go on
when you're gone
though I try how can I carry on

when you're gone
how can I even try to go on
when you're gone
though I try how can I carry on
