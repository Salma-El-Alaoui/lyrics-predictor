I've been running
 In circles all day long
 I'm out of breath
 But I'm still going strong

I'm gonna get you, yeah
 No matter what they say
 You think I'm losing
 But I always get my way

Hey, don't walk away
 When I'm talking to you
 This ain't no time for your
 Bad attitude

Don't gimme that face
 When you know I'm really
 Down for the chase

'Cause my heart's already in it
 And I'm never gonna quit it
 When you finally gonna get it
 Don't walk away when I'm talking to you

You act, act like
 That I don't have a clue
 You think you know it all
 But I'm so onto you

You think you figured out
 Just how to win this game
 I'm on your tracks
 Yeah, I know every move you make

Hey, don't walk away
 When I'm talking to you
 This ain't no time for your
 Bad attitude

Don't gimme that face
 When you know I'm really
 Down for the chase

'Cause my heart's already in it
 And I'm never gonna quit it
 When you finally gonna get it
 Don't walk away

I won't give up just like that
 I'm gonna make you mine
 If it takes everything I have

Don't walk away
 When I'm talking to you
 This ain't no time for your
 Bad attitude

Don't gimme that face
 When you know I'm really
 Down for the chase

'Cause my heart's already in it
 And I'm never gonna quit it
 When you finally gonna get it
 Don't walk away when I'm talking to you

Yeah, don't gimme that face
 When you know I'm really
 Down for the chase

'Cause my heart's already in it
 And I'm never gonna quit it
 When you finally gonna get it
 Don't walk away
