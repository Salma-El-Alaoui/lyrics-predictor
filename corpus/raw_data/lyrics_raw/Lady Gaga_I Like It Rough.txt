(Lady GaGa)
(I like it rough)

Your love is nothing I can't fight
Can't sleep with the man
Who dims my shine

I'm in the bedroom with tissues and when-
I know you're outside banging but I won't let you in
'Cause it's a hard life, with love in the world
And now my hard girl lovin' is like chewing on pearls

You got me wondering why I
I like it rough, I-I like it rough, I-I like it rough
You got me wondering why I
I like it rough, I-I like it rough, I-I like it rough

Won't go without my fix tonight
It's a little too rough
Prom girl wipes her tears with silver lines
And she can't get enough

I'm in the bedroom with tissues and when-
I know you're outside banging but I won't let you in
'Cause it's a hard life, with love in the world
And now my hard girl lovin' is like straightening curls

You got me wondering why I
I like it rough, I-I like it rough, I-I like it rough
You got me wondering why I
I like it rough, I-I like it rough, I-I like it rough

Shiny and I know it
Don't know why you wanna blow it
Need a man who likes it rough
Likes it rough, likes it rough
(baby likes it a-rough)

Shiny and I know it
Don't know why you wanna blow it
Need a man who likes it rough
Likes it rough, likes it rough
(baby likes it a-rough)

Is it 'cause you don't mean it?
Or because I don't feel it?
Yes it's rough
Is it 'cause you don't mean it?
Or because I don't feel it?
Yes it's rough

(Lady GaGa)

You got me wondering why I
I like it rough, I-I like it rough, I-I like it rough
You got me wondering why I
I like it rough, I-I like it rough, I-I like it rough

You got me wondering why I
I like it rough, I-I like it rough, I-I like it rough
You got me wondering why I
I like it rough, I-I like it rough, I-I like it rough
