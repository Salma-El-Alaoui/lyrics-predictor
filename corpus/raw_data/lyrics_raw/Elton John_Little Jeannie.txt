Oh little Jeannie
You got so much love
Little Jeannie
And you take it where it strikes
and give it to the likes of me

Oh little Jeannie
She got so much love
Little Jeannie
So I see you when I can
You make me all a man can be

And I want you to be my acrobat
I want you to be my lover
Oh there were others who would treat you cruel
And oh little Jeannie
You were always someone's fool

Little Jeannie
You got so much time
Little Jeannie
Though you've grown beyond your years
You still retain the fears of youth

Oh little Jeannie
You got so much time
Little Jeannie
But you're burning it up so fast
Searching for some lasting truth

And I want you to be my acrobat
I want you to be my lover
Oh there were others who would treat you cruel
But oh Jeannie
I will always be your fool

[Saxophone solo]

And I want you to be my acrobat
I want you to be my lover
Oh there were others
and I've known quite a few
But oh oh Jeannie
I'm still in love with you...

(You stepped into my life from a bad dream)
(Making the life that I had seem suddenly shiny and new)
Oh Jeannie(Oh Jeannie...) I'm so in love with you...

(You stepped into my life from a bad dream)
(Making the life that I had seem suddenly shiny and new)
Oh Jeannie(Oh Jeannie...) I'm so in love with you...

(You stepped into my life from a bad dream)
(Making the life that I had seem suddenly shiny and new)
Oh Jeannie(Oh Jeannie...) I'm so in love with you...

(You stepped into my life from a bad dream)So...
(Making the life that I had seem) suddenly shiny and new
Oh Jeannie(Oh Jeannie...) I'm so in love
[fading]
I'm so...(You stepped into my life from a bad dream)...in love
(Making the life that I had seem) suddenly shiny and new
Oh Jeannie(Oh Jeannie...) I'm so in love

I'm so...(You stepped into my life from a bad dream)...in love
