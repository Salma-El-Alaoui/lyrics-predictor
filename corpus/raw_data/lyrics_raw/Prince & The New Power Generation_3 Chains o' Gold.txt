3 Chains O' Gold

If I don't think about the fact that she left me
If I don't see the pearls fall from the sky
If I don't hear the accusations of blasphemy
If I don't feel the tears in my eyes
This is the best day of my life

U say U'll call me and then U don't
I want 2 kiss U and then I won't
We both do nothing and call it love
Is this love?
Is this love?

This morning I wanted a cup of coffee
But I didn't have any cream
Last night I wanted some inspiration
But I didn't have any dreams
Coupled with the fact that U belong 2 another
Whose name is self-righteousness
So evil girl, if one of us has a date with the undertaker
Which one will it be?
U can cry 4ever, but U'll get no sympathy
This is the best day of my life!

I've got 3 chains of gold
And they will shine 4ever
They are the nucleus of my soul
Melt down? No, they will never
I've got 3 chains of gold
And they will shine 4ever
They are the nucleus of my soul
Melt down? No, they will never

Yes Give back the chains
If U don't, U will die
Nothing should come between U and I

I've got 3 chains of gold
And they will shine 4ever
If one of us has 2 go
U will go before me
If one of us has 2 go (3 chains of gold)
U will go before me (3 chains of gold)
U will go before me, baby (They will shine 4ever)
Cuz I sho'nuff say U will

(3 chains of gold)
(U will go before me) {x4}
I've got 3 chains of gold

They gonna shineâ€¦ 4ever, 4ever, 4ever!
(3 chains of gold)
