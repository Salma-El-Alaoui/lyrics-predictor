saint anger round my neck
saint anger round my neck
he never gets respect
saint anger round my neck

(you flush it out, you flush it out)
saint anger round my neck
(you flush it out, you flush it out)
he never gets respect
(you flush it out, you flush it out)
saint anger round my neck
(you flush it out, you flush it out)
he never gets respect

fuck it all and no regrets
i hit the lights on these dark sets
i need a voice to let myself, to let myself go free
fuck it all and fucking no regrets
i hit the lights on these dark sets
Medallion noose, i hang my self, saint anger round my neck

i feel my world shake
like an earthquake
it's hard to see clear
is it me, is it fear

im madly in anger with you
im madly in anger with you

saint anger round my neck
saint anger round my neck
he never gets respect
saint anger round my neck

you flush it out, you flush it out)
saint anger round my neck
(you flush it out, you flush it out)
he never gets respect
(you flush it out, you flush it out)
saint anger round my neck
(you flush it out, you flush it out)
he never gets respect

fuck it all and no regrets
i hit the lights on these dark sets
i need a voice to let myself, to let myself go free
fuck it all and fucking no regrets
i hit the lights on these dark sets
Medallion noose, i hang my self, saint anger round my neck

i feel my world shake
like an earthquake
it's hard to see clear
is it me, is it fear

im madly in anger with you
im madly in anger with you
im madly in anger with you
im madly in anger with you

and i want, my anger to be healthy
and i want, my anger just for me
and i need, my anger not to control
yeah and i want, my anger to be me
and i need, to set my anger free
and i need, to set my anger free
and i need, to set my anger free
and i need, to set my anger free
set it free

fuck it all and no regrets
i hit the lights on these dark sets
i need a voice to let myself, to let myself go free
fuck it all and fucking no regrets
i hit the lights on these dark sets
Medallion noose, i hang my self, saint anger round my neck
