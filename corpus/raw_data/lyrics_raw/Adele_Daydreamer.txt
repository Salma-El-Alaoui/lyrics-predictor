Daydreamer, sittinâ?? on the seat
Soaking up the sun he is a
Real lover, makinâ?? up the past and feeling up his girl like heâ??s never felt her figure before
Her joy (..?)
Looks good when he when he walks, he is the subject of their talk
He would be hard to chase, but good to catch and he could change the world with his hands behind his back, Ohâ?¦

You can find him sittinâ?? on your doorstep
Waiting for the surprise
It will feel like heâ??s been there for hours
And you can tell that heâ??ll be there for life

Daydreamer, with eyes that make you melt
He lends his coat for shelter because heâ??s there for you when he shouldnâ??t be
But he stays all the same, waits for you and then sees you through
Thereâ??s no way I could describe him
All I say is, just what Iâ??m hoping for

But I will find him sittinâ?? on my doorstep
Waiting for the surprise
It will feel like heâ??s been there for hours
And I can tell heâ??ll be there for life
And I can tell heâ??ll be there for life
