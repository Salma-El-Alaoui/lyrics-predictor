Hey, Jaded
You got your mama's style
But you're yesterday's child to me
So jaded
You think that's where it's at
But is that where it's s'posed to be
You're gettin' it all over me
Exer-ated

My my baby blue
Yeah, I've been thinkin' 'bout you
My my baby blue
Yeah, you're so jaded
And I'm the one that jaded you

Hey, Jaded
In all it's misery
It will always be what I love
And hated
And maybe take a ride
To the other side we're thinkin' of
We'll slip into the velvet glove
And be jaded

My my baby blue
Yeah, I been thinkin' 'bout you
My my baby blue
Yeah I'm so jaded
And baby, I'm afraid of you

You're thinkin' so complicated
I've had it all up to here
But it's so overrated
Love and hate it
Wouldn't trade it
Love me Jaded, yeah

Hey, Jaded
There ain't no baby please
When I'm shootin' the breeze with her
When everything you see is a blur
And ecstasy's what you prefer

My my baby blue, yeah
I'm a talkin' 'bout you
My my baby blue
Yeah, I been thinkin' 'bout you
My my baby blue
Yeah, you're so jaded (baby)
Jaded (baby)
You're so jaded
'Cause I'm the one that jaded you
