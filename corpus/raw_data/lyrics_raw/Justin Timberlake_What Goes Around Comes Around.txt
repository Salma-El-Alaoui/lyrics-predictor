Hey girl, is he everything you wanted in a man?
You know I gave you the world
You had me in the palm of your hand
So, why your love went away?
I just can't seem to understand
Thought it was me and you, baby
Me and you until the end
But I guess I was wrong

Don't wanna think about it
Don't wanna talk about it
I'm just so sick about it
Can't believe it's ending this way
Just so confused about it
Feeling abused about it
I just can't do without you
So, tell me is this fair?

Is this the way it's really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye?
Should've known better when you came around
That you were gonna make me cry
It's breaking my heart to watch you run around
Cause I know that you're living a lie
But, that's okay, baby, cause in time you will find

What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around

Yeah

Now, girl, I remember everything that you claimed
You said that you were moving on now, and maybe I should do the same
The funny thing about that is I was ready to give you my name
Thought it was me and you, baby
And, now, it's all just a shame and I guess I was wrong

Don't wanna think about it
Don't wanna talk about it
I'm just so sick about it
Can't believe it's ending this way
Just so confused about it
Feeling abused about it
I just can't do without you
Can you tell me is this fair?

Is this the way it's really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye?
Should've known better when you came around
That you were gonna make me cry
And, now, it's breaking my heart to watch you run around
Cause I know that you're living a lie
But, that's okay, baby, cause in time you will find

What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around

Yeah

What goes around comes around, yeah
What goes around comes around, you should know that

Let me paint this picture for you, baby

You spend your nights alone and he never comes home
And every time you call him, all you get's a busy tone
I heard you found out that he's doing to you what you did to me
Ain't that the way it goes?
When you cheated, girl, my heart bleeded girl
So, that goes without saying that you left me feeling hurt
Just a classic case, scenario
Tale as old as time
Girl, you got what you deserve

And, now, you want somebody to cure the lonely nights
You wish you had somebody that could come and make it right
But, girl, I ain't somebody
I'm out of sympathy
See, see...

(What goes around comes back around)
I thought I told you
Hey

(See)
(You should've listened to me, baby)

(Because)
What goes around comes back around
