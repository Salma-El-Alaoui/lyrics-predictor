Top down, on the strip
Lookin' in the mirror and
I'm checkin out my lipstick
Girlfriends up in the back
We're out for an all night

Feelin' so crazy cool
Vibe so right
Don't know what they're ready for it
Valet
Baby here's the keys
We're about to step inside

Skip on the drinks
Head to the floor
Makin' my way
That's for sure
My body's takin' over
And I want some more
(Woah yeah yeah)

I'll be anticipating
This is our song they're playing
I don't know what your thinking
You're feelin' this right
Let's do this tonight

Step up
baby don't be shy
I know you're feeling me
'Cause you're giving me the eye
And I
don't wanna play around
Baby watch me move
Check this, let's make a scene
Don't leave me waiting longer
Why you wanna make me long for ya
Move it, baby over here
So we can set it off

We can get down to the DJ's sound
Feel soo good, baby all around
Feelin' kinda naughty
Come and get me now
(Oh oh yeah)

I'll be anticipating
(Anticipating)
This is our song they're playing
I wanna rock with you
You're feelin' this right
Let's do this tonight
(Oh)

Gotta really let me know if you want me
You gotta turn me on and make me feel sexy
Gotta show me you got everything that I need (x2)

I'll be anticipating
This is our song they're playing
(Yeah yeah)
I wanna rock with you
(Yeah oh yeah)
You're feelin' this right
Let's do this tonight
(I feel ya groove ya)

I'll be anticipating
This is our song they're playing
I wanna rock with you
You're feelin' this right
Let's do this tonight

Gotta really let me know if you want me
You gotta turn me on and make me feel sexy
Gotta show me you got everything that I need (x2) (fade)
