They can say anything they want to say
Try to bring me down
But I will not allow anyone to succeed
Hanging clouds over me
And they can try hard to make me feel that I
Don't matter at all
But I refuse to falter in what I believe
Or lose faith in my dreams
Cause there, there's a light in me
That shines brightly
They can try but they cant take that away from me

Oh, they, they can do
Anything they want to you
If you let them in
But they wont ever win
If you cling to your pride
And just push them aside
See I, I have learned
There's an inner peace I own
Something in my soul that they cannot possess
So I wont be afraid and the darkness will fade

Cause there, there's a light in me
That shines brightly, yes
They can try but they cant take that away from me

No, they cant take this precious love I'll always have inside me
Certainly the Lord will guide me
Where I need to go

Oh, they can say anything they want to say
Try to bring me down
But I wont face the ground
I will rise steadily sailing out of their reach
Oh, Lord, they do try
Hard to make me feel that I dont matter at all
But I refuse to falter in what I believe or lose faith in my dreams
Cause there's a light in me
That shines brightly, yes
They can try but they cant take that away from me
