Come on, come on
Now, touch me, babe
Can't you see that I am not afraid
What was that promise that you made
Why won't you tell me what she said
What was that promise that you made

Now I'm gonna love you
'Til the heavens stop the rain
I'm gonna love you
'Til the stars fall from the sky
For you and I
