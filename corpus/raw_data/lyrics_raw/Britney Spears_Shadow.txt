Your body's warm but you are not
You give a little not a lot
You coup your love until we kiss
You're all I want but not like this

I'm watching you disappear
But you, you were never here

It's only your shadow, never yourself
It's only your shadow, nobody else
It's only your shadow, filling the room
Arriving too late, and leaving too soon
And leaving too soon...

Your body gives but then holds back
The sun is bright, the sky is black
Can only be another sign
I cannot keep what isn't mine

You left and it lingers on
But you, you were almost gone

It's only your shadow, never yourself
It's only your shadow, nobody else
It's only your shadow, filling the room
Arriving too late, and leaving too soon
And leaving too soon...

I cannot tell if you mean what you say
You say it so loud, but you sound far away
Maybe I had just a glimpse of your soul
Or was that your shadow I saw on the wall

I'm watching you disappear
But you, you were never here

It's only your shadow, never yourself
It's only your shadow, nobody else
It's only your shadow, filling the room
Arriving too late
No, no, no
It's only your shadow
It's only your shadow, nobody else
It's only your shadow
Arriving too late and leaving too soon

It's only your shadow
