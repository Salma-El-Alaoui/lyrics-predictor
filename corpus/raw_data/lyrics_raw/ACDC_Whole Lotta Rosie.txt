Wanna tell you a story
'Bout a woman I know
When it comes to lovin'
Oh, she steals the show
She ain't exactly pretty
She ain't exaclty small
42-39-56
You could say she's got it ALLLLLL!!!!!!!!!!!

Never had a woman, never had a woman like you
Doin' all the things, doin' all the things you do
Ain't no fairy story
Ain't no skin-and-bones
But you give all you got, weighin' in at nineteen stone

You're a whole lotta woman
A whole lotta woman
I gotta whole lotta Rosie
A whole lotta Rosie
A whole lotta Rosie
I gotta whole lotta woman, yeah-yeah-yeah

Honey, you can do, do it to me all night long
Only one can turn, only one can turn me on
All through the night-time
Right around the clock
To my suprise, Rosie never stops

You're a whole lotta woman
A whole lotta woman
I gotta whole lotta Rosie
A whole lotta Rosie
A whole lotta Rosie
I gotta whole lotta woman, yeah-yeah-yeah
