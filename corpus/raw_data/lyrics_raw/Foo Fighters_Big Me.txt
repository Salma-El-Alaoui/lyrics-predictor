When I talk about it
Carries on
Reasons only knew
When I talk about it
Aries or
Treasons all renew

If we can get around it
I know that it's true

When I talked about it
Carried on
Reasons only knew
But it's you
I fell into

Big me to talk about it
I could stand to prove
If we can get around it
I know that it's true

Well I talked about it
Put it on
Never was it true
But it's you
I fell into

Well I talked about it
Put it on
Never was it true
But it's you
I fell into
