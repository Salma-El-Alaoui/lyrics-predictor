Dont know how to take it, dont know where to go
My resistances running low
And every day the hold is getting tighter and it troubles me so
(you know that Im nobodys fool)
Im nobodys fool and yet its clear to me
I dont have a strategy
Its just like taking candy from a baby and I think I must be

Under attack, Im being taken
About to crack, defences breaking
Wont somebody please have a heart
Come and rescue me now cause Im falling apart
Under attack, Im taking cover
Hes on my track, my chasing lover
Thinking nothings gonna stop him now
Should I want to, Im not sure I know how

This is getting crazy, I should tell him so
Really let my anger show
cause waiting at the answer to his questions is a definite no!
(Im kinda flattered I suppose)
Guess Im kind of flattered but Im scared as hell
Staring down the deepest well
I hardly dare to think of what could happen, where Id be if I fell

Under attack, Im being taken
About to crack, defences breaking
Wont somebody please have a heart
Come and rescue me now cause Im falling apart
Under attack, Im taking cover
He saw my track, my chasing lover
Thinking nothings gonna stop him now
Should I want to, Im not sure, I wont know how

Under attack, Im being taken
About to crack, defences breaking
Wont somebody see and save a heart
Come and rescue me now cause Im falling apart
Under attack, Im taking cover
He saw my track, my chasing lover
Thinking nothings gonna stop him now
Should I want to, Im not sure, I wont know how
