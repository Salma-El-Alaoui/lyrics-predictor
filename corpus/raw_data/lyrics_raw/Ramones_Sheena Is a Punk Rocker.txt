Well the kids are all hopped up and ready to go
They're ready to go now
They got their surfboards
And they're going to the Discotheque Au Go Go
But she just couldn't stay
She had to break away
Well New York City really has it all
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

Sheena is a punk rocker
Sheena is a punk rocker
Sheena is a punk rocker now.

Sheena is a punk rocker
Sheena is a punk rocker
Sheena is a punk rocker now.

She's a punk punk, a punk rocker
Punk punk, a punk rocker
Punk punk, a punk rocker.
