This is a story about control, my control
Control of what I say, control of what I do
And this time I'm gonna do it my way
I hope you enjoy this as much as I do
Are we ready? I am? Cause it's all about control
And I've got lots of it

When I was 17, I did what people told me
Did what my father said, and let my mother mold me
But that was long ago

I'm in control, never gonna stop
Control, to get what I want
Control, I got to have a lot
Control, now I'm all grown up

First time I fell in love
I didn't know what hit me
So young and so naive
I thought it would be easy
But now I know I've go to take...

I'm in control, never gonna stop
Control, to get what I want
Control, I got to have a lot
Control, now I'm all grown up

That's right, I'm on my own,
I'll call my own shots, thank you

Got my own mind
I wanna make my own decisions
When it has to do with my life, my life
I wanna be the one in control

So let me take you by the hand
And lead you on this dance
Cause what I've got is because I took a chance
I don't wanna rule the world
Just wanna run my life
So make your life a little easier
When you get the chance just take...

I'm in control, never gonna stop
Control, to get what I want
Control, I got to have a lot
Control, now I'm all grown up

Free at last, out here on my own
Now control this
That's right, career moves
I do what's right for me
And me wants to groove
Is that ok?

Got my own mind
I wanna make my own decisions
When it has to do with my life, my life
I wanna be the one in control

Hop to it
I'm in control (and I love it, that's right)
Control, now I've got a lot
Control, now I'm all grown up
I'm in control, I'm in control

Don't make me lose it
