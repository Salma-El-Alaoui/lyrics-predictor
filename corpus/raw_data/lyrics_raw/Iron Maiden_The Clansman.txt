Wake alone in the hills
with the wind in your face
It feels good to be proud
and be free and a race
That is part of a clan
and to live on highlands
And the air that you breathe
so pure and so clean

When alone on the hills
With the wind in your hair
With a longing to feel ..
Just to be free

Is it right to believe
in the need to be free
It's a time when you die
and without asking why
Can't you see what they do
they are grinding us down
They are taking our land
that belongs to the clans

Not alone with a dream
Just want to be free
With a need to belong
I am a clansman .....Freedom

It's a time wrought with fear
it's a land wrought with change

Ancestors could hear
What is happening now
They would turn in their graves
they would all be ashamed
That the land of the free
has been written in chains
And I know what I want

When the timing is right
Then I'll take what is mine
I am the clansman

And I swear to defend
And we'll fight to the end
And I swear that I'll never
be taken alive
And I know that we'll stand
and we'll fight for our land
And I swear that my bairns Will be born free

And I know what I want
When the timing is right
Then I'll take what i want
I am the clansman .....freedom

No, no we can't let them take anymore
No we can't let them take anymore
We've the land of the free
Freedom

Is it right to believe
in the need to be free
It's a time when you die
and without asking why
Can't you see what they do
they are grinding us down
They are taking our land
that belongs to the clans

Not alone with a dream
Just want to be free
With a need to belong
I am a clansman

And I know what I want
When the timing is right
Then I'll take what is mine
I am the clansman
Freedom

And I know what I want
When the timing is right
Then I'll take what is mine
I am the clansman
