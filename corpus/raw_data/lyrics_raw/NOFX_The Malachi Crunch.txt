Did you get that rush, that feeling, adrenalin

pumping through your veins?

A lifeless body in the gutter, city streets are stained

How do you rationalize, what do you see

in your reflection?

A kid just having fun, A soldiers bloodied

boot impression

One for all and all for one, especially when

it's ten on one

You don't care what you're doing, you know

it sure is fun



If it happened to your mother would

you laugh so hard?

Well, that was someones son or brother

That you kicked so hard



This time you went too far

What's the matter, don't you feel alright?

Do you feel remorse?

Or are the handcuffs on a little too tight?



Now that your friends are gone, you've got no

defense, no protection

5 or 6 times a day you receive your hot beef injection

I hope every time you're cornholed

terror fills your mind

The one emotion you have inspired one too many

times.
