Words &amp;amp; music by Paul Simon

When I was a little boy, (when I was just a boy)
And the Devil would call my name (when I was just a boy)
I'd say &amp;quot;now who do,
Who do you think you're fooling?&amp;quot; (when I was just a boy)
I'm a consecrated boy (when I was just a boy)
I'm a singer in a Sunday choir
Oh , my mama loves, she loves me
She get down on her knees and hug me
Like she loves me like a rock
She rocks me like the rock of ages
And loves me
She love me, love me, love me, love me

When I was grown to be a man (grown to be a man)
And the Devil would call my name (grown to be a man)
I'd say &amp;quot;now who do,
Who do you think you're fooling?&amp;quot; (grown to be a man)
I'm a consummated man (grown to be a man)
I can snatch a little purity
My mama loves me, she loves me
She get down on her knees and hug me
Like she loves me like a rock
She rocks me like the rock of ages
And loves me
She love me, love me, love me, love me
And if I was President (was the President)
The minute Congress call my name (was the President)
I'd say &amp;quot;who do,
Who do you think you're fooling? (Who do you think you're fooling)

I've got the Presidential Seal (was the president)
I'm up on the Presidential Podium
My mama loves me
She loves me
She get down on her knees and hug me
Like she loves me like a rock
She rocks me like the rock of ages
And loves me

Fade out:
She love me, love me, love me, love me
(loves me like a rock)
