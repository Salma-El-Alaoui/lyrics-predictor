Tonight I'm gonna have myself a real good time
I feel alive
And the world turning inside out, yeah
And floating around in ecstasy, so
Don't stop me now
Don't stop me
'Cuz I'm having a good time, having a good time

I'm a shooting star leaping through the sky
Like a tiger defying the laws of gravity
I'm a racing car passing by like Lady Godiva
I'm gonna go, go, go
There's no stopping me

I'm burning through the sky, yeah
Two hundred degrees
That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm a traveling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic man out of you

(Don't stop me now) I'm having such a good time, I'm having a ball
(Don't stop me now) if you wanna have a good time just give me a call
(Don't stop me now) 'Cuz I'm havin' a good time
(Don't stop me now) Yes, I'm havin' a good time
I don't want to stop at all

I'm a rocket ship on my way to Mars
On a collision course
I am a satellite, I'm out of control
I am a sex machine ready to reload
Like an atom bomb about to
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, explode

I'm burning through the sky, yeah
Two hundred degrees
That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm traveling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic woman of you

Don't stop me, don't stop me
Don't stop me, hey hey hey!
Don't stop me, don't stop me
Oh, ooh, ooh, (I like it)
Don't stop me, don't stop me
Have a good time, good time
Don't stop me, don't stop me

I'm burning through the sky, yeah
Two hundred degrees
That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm traveling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic man out of you

(Don't stop me now) I'm having such a good time, I'm having a ball
(Don't stop me now) if you wanna have a good time just give me a call
(Don't stop me now) 'Cuz I'm havin' a good time
(Don't stop me now) Yes, I'm havin' a good time
I don't want to stop at all
