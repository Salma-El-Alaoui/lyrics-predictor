You know the day destroys the night
Night divides the day
Tried to run
Tried to hide
Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side
Chased our pleasure here
Dug our treasure there
Still recall
Time we cried
Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side
Break on through, yeah!

Wow!
Wow!

Everybody loves my baby
Everybody loves my baby

The woman get high. She get high.
She get high. Baby, so high.
She get high. She get high.
The woman get high. She get high.
Wow!

I found an island in your arms
Country in your eyes
Arms that chain us
Eyes that lie
Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side
Break on through, yeah!
All right!

Yeah, made the scene
Week to week
Day to day
Hour to hour
The gate is straight
Deep and wide

Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side
Break on through
Break on through
Break on through
Break on through
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
