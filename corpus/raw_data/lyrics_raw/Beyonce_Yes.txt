I said Yes to your number
And Yes to you dating me
And Yes we can be together
But you gotta wait for me
The first time I say no
Its like I never said Yes

I said Yes we can be together
Yes you can stay with me
but when i say no not tonight
You acting so ungratefully
The first time I say no
Its like I never said Yes

You was on the wall
I was with my crew
You was watching me baby
I was watchin you
Slowly you walked over
I maintained my cool
You said hello to me
I said hello to you

You ask me where Im from
I asked you what you do
You somehow intrigued me
I thought you were so cool
Somewhere between hi and goodbye
I felt so comfortable
I felt like we could talk all night
So I gave my number to you

I said Yes to your number
And Yes to you dating me
Yes we can be together
But you gotta wait for me
The first time I say no
Its like I never said Yes

I said Yes we can be together
Yes you can stay with me
but when i say no not tonight
You actin so ungratefully
The first time I say no
Its like I never said Yes

Certainly you can call me baby
I love to hear from you
Yes of course you can come and see me boy
I want to get to know you more
Shoot, Im feelin you
No baby, not yet, we cant take that next step
Why you gettin so upset?
Boy you actin as though I never told you Yes before
You are so ungrateful

You was at my house
I was sitting on my couch
You was really bugging
So I told you to get out
I had been misjudging you
You had a lotta nerve
You too damn old to be so immature
I hope you learn

You said I move too slow
I showed you to the door
You said you'd call me later
I said dont call no more
Its cool if you cant wait for me
Im glad you let me know
Cuz you showed me your true face baby
The first time I said no

I said Yes to your number
And Yes to you dating me
And Yes we can be together
But you gotta wait for me
The first time I say no
Its like I never said Yes

I said Yes we can be together
Yes you can stay with me
but when i say no not tonight
You acting so ungratefully
The first time I say no
Its like I never said Yes before

( fades )
I said Yes to your number
And Yes to you dating me
And Yes we can be together
But you gotta wait for me
The first time I say no
Its like I never said Yes
