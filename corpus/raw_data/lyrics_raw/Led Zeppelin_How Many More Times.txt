How many more times
Treat me the way you wanna do?
How many more times
Treat me the way you wanna do?
When I give you all my love, please, please be true

I'll give you all I've got to give
Rings, pearls, and all
I'll give you all I've got to give
Rings, pearls, and all
I've got to get you together baby, I'm sure, sure you're gonna crawl

Oh! Wanna love some other man too?

I was a young man, I couldn't resist
Started thinkin' it over, just what I had missed
Got me a girl and I kissed her and then and then
Whoops, oh Lordy, well I did it again
Now I've got ten children of my own
I got another child on the way that makes eleven
But I'm in constant heaven
I know it's alright in my mind
'Cause I got a little schoolgirl and she's all mine
I can't get through to her 'cause it doesn't permit
But I'm gonna give her everything I've got to give

Oh Rosie, oh girl
Oh Rosie, oh girl
Steal away now, steal away
Steal away baby, steal away
Little Robert Anthony wants to come and play
Why don't ya come with me baby?
Steal away
Alright, alright

Well they call me the hunter, that's my name
Call me the hunter, that's how I got my fame
Ain't no need to hide, ain't no need to run
'Cause I've got you in the sights of my gun

How many more times
Barrelhouse all night long, all right
How many more times
Barrelhouse all night long
Well I've got to get to you, baby
Girl, please come home

Why don't you listen to me babe?
Why don't you please come home?
Why don't you please come home?
Why don't you please come home?
