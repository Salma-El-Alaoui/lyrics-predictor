Stranded, lost inside myself
My own worst friend and my own closest enemy
Branded, Maladjusted
Never trusted anyone let alone myself

I must insist
On being a pessimist
I'm a loner in a catastrophic mind

Elected the rejected
I perfected the science of the idiot
No meaning and no healing
Self loathing freak and introverted deviant

I must insist
On being a pessimist
I'm a loner in a catastrophic mind
