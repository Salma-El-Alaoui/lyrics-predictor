Living easy, loving free
Season ticket on a one-way ride
Asking nothing, leave me be
Taking everything in my stride
Don't need reason, don't need rhyme
Ain't nothing that I'd rather do
Going down, party time
My friends are gonna be there too

I'm on the highway to hell
On the highway to hell
Highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell

No stop signs, speed limit
Nobody's gonna slow me down
Like a wheel, gonna spin it
Nobody's gonna mess me around
Hey Satan, paid my dues
Playing in a rocking band
Hey momma, look at me
I'm on my way to the promised land

I'm on the highway to hell
Highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
Highway to hell

Don't stop me!

I'm on the highway to hell
On the highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
On the highway to hell

Highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
Highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
Highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
Highway to hell

And I'm going down all the way

We're on the highway to hell
