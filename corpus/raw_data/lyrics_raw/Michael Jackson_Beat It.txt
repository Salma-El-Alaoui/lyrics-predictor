They told him don't you ever come around here
Don't wanna see your face, you better disappear
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear
So beat it, just beat it

You better run, you better do what you can
Don't wanna see no blood, don't be a macho man (Uh)
You wanna be tough, better do what you can
So beat it, but you wanna be bad

Just beat it, (beat it), beat it, (beat it)
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky strong it's your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it, beat it
Just beat it, beat it
Just beat it, beat it
Just beat it, beat it

Uh!

They're out to get you, better leave while you can
Don't wanna be a boy, you wanna be a man
You wanna stay alive, better do what you can
So beat it, just beat it (Uh)

You have to show them that you're really not scared (Uuh)
You're playin' with your life, this ain't no truth or dare (Uh!)
They'll kick you, then they beat you,
Then they'll tell you it's fair
So beat it, but you wanna be bad

Just beat it, (beat it), beat it, (beat it)
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky strong it's your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Chorus
Just beat it, (beat it), beat it, (beat it)
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky strong it's your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it (x 12)

(Guitar solo)

Beat it, (beat it), beat it, (beat it)
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky strong it's your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
(Oooh, right!)
(wooohooo)

Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated (Oh, lord)
Showin' how funky (Eeh, eeh) strong it's your fight (Eeh, eeh)
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right

Just beat it, (beat it), beat it, (beat it), beat it
No one wants to be defeated (Oh, no)
Showin' how funky (Eeh, eeh)strong it's your fight(Eeh, eeh)
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right

Just beat it, (beat it), beat it, (beat it)
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky strong it's your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right (Whoâ€™s wrong)
Just beat it, (beat it) (Wooohooo)
Beat it, beat it, beat it
