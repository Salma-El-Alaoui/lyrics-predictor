My baby moves at midnight
Goes right on till the dawn
My woman take me higher
My woman keep me warm

What you doin' on your back aah
What you doin' on your back aah?
You should be dancing, yeah
dancing, yeah
(repeat)

She's juicy and she's trouble
She gets it to me good
My woman give me power
Goes right down to my blood

What you doin' on your back aah
What you doin' on your back aah?
You should be dancing, yeah
dancing, yeah
(repeat)

My baby moves at midnight
Goes right on till the dawn, yeah
My woman take me higher
My woman keep me warm

What you doin' on your back aah
What you doin' on your back aah?
You should be dancing, yeah
dancing, yeah
(repeat)

You should be dancing, yeah
You should be dancing, yeah
You should be dancing, yeah
You should be dancing, yeah
You should be dancing, yeah
(repeat until fades)
