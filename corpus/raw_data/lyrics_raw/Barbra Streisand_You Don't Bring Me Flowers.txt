Barbara
You don't bring me flowers
You don't sing me love songs
Neil
You hardly talk to me anymore
When I come through the door at the end of the day...
Barbara
I remember when you couldn't wait to love me
Used to hate to leave me
Now after loving me late at night
Neil
When it's good for you, babe
And you're feeling all right
Barbara
When you just roll over and turn out the light...
And you don't bring me flowers anymore
Neil
It used to be so natural
Barbara
It used to be...
Neil
To talk about forever
Barbara
Mmm...
Neil
But used-to-bes don't count anymore
They just lay on the floor
Till we sweep them away
Barbara
And baby I remember all the things you taught me
Neil
I learned how to laugh and I learned how to cry
Barbra
Well, I learned how to love and I learned how to lie
Neil
So you think I could learn how to tell you goodbye
Barbara
So you think I could learn how to tell you goodbye
You don't bring me flowers any more...
Both
Well, you think I could learn how to tell you goodbye...
Neil
?Cause you don?t say you need me;
Barbara
You don't sing me love songs;
Both
You don't bring me flowers anymore...
