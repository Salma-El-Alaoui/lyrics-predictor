Hitting walls for a feet
With our friends and we hear this free
All the dogs, dropping bombs
He see

HUCK IT
You don't have the ties
You won't have the eyes
HUCK IT
Cause you realize
You don't need to justify
That cable show is not the lives we know

Drop a bomb in the publics eye
Fuck the Spartans they always lie
You are pointing to go fast and GO

Broken bombs and baking skin
Notify your next of kin
You'll know you'll come alive some day

HUCK IT
Now you feel alive,
stinks like shit all the time
HUCK IT
Its like you gotta try
risky shit, by the time
You can not practice lay it on the line

HUCK IT
Now you're down in luck
cause you dont give a fuck
HUCK IT
And go by the time
You go out doin what you know
no talking shit just leave it all and go home

HUCK IT
Now youll feel alive
stinks like shit all the time
HUCK IT
Like you gotta try
risky shit by the time
can't practice just lay it on the line

HUCK IT
Now you're down in luck
cause you dont give a fuck
HUCK IT
And go by the time
You go out doin what you know
no talking shit just leave it all and go home
