Outta my way I'm a runnin high
Take your chance with me and I'll give it a try
Ain't no woman in the world I know
Cause I ain't looking for an overflow
Oh baby I ain't got much
Resistance to your touch
Take off the high heels, let down your hair
Paradise ain't far from there

I wanna walk all over you
I wanna walk all over you
Do anything you want me to, baby
I wanna walk all over you

Reflections on the bedroom wall
And girl you thought you'd seen it all
We're rising, falling like the sea
You're looking so good under me

I'm gonna walk all over you
I'm gonna walk all over you
Do anything you want me to do to you
I'm gonna walk all over you

Moanin, groanin stereo
Said gimme the stage, I'm gonna steal the show
Leave on the lace and turn off the light
Tonight is gonna be the night

I'm gonna walk all over you
I'm gonna walk all over you
Do anything you want me to
I'm gonna walk all over you

Ow, I'm gonna walk all over you
