Well I'm going out west where I belong
Where the days are short and the nights are long

And I'll walk
And they'll walk
And I'll twist
And they'll twist
And I'll shimmy
And they'll shimmy
And I'll fly
And they'll fly

Where we're out there having fun
In the warm California sun

Well, I'm going out west out on the coast
Where the California girls are really the most

And I'll walk
And they'll walk
And I'll twist
And they'll twist
And I'll shimmy
And they'll shimmy
And I'll fly
And they'll fly

Where we're out there having fun
In the warm California sun

Well, the girls are frisky in old 'Frisco
A pretty little chick wherever you go

And I'll walk
And they'll walk
And I'll twist
And they'll twist
And I'll shimmy
And they'll shimmy
And I'll fly
And they'll fly

Where we're out there having fun
In the warm California sun
Where we're out there having fun
In the warm California sun
