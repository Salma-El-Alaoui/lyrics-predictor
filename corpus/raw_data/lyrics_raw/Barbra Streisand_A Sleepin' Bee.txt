When a bee lies sleepin' in the palm of your hand,
You're bewitched, and deep in love's long looked-after land.
Where you'll see a sun-up sky with a mornin' moon,
and where the days go laughin' by, as love comes a callin' on you.

Sleep on bee, don't waken, can't believe what just passed.
He's mine for the takin' I am happy at last.
Maybe I dreams, but he seems sweet golden as a crown
A sleepin' bee done told me, I will walk with my feet off the ground
when my one true love, I has found.

Sleep on bee, don't waken! Cannot believe what just passed!
He's mine for the takin'. I am happy at last.
Maybe I dreams, but he seems golden as a crown.
A sleepin' bee done told me, I will walk with my feet off the ground,
when my one true love, I has found!
