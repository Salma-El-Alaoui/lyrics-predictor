I live in an apartment on the 99th floor of my block
And I sit at home looking out the window imagining the world has stopped
Then in flies a guy who's all dressed up just like a Union Jack
And says, "I've won five pounds if I have his kind of detergent pack"

I said hey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud
Hey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud
Hey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud
Don't hang around 'cause two's a crowd on my cloud, baby

The telephone is ringing I say, "Hi, it's me, who is it there on the line?"
A voice says, "Hi, hello, how are you?" "Well, I guess I'm doin' fine"
He says, "It's 3 AM, there's too much noise, don't you people ever wanna go to
bed?
Just 'cause you feel so good, do you have to drive me out of my head?"

I said hey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud
Hey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud
Hey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud
Don't hang around 'cause two's a crowd on my cloud, baby

I was sick and tired, fed up with this and decided to take a drive downtown
It was so very quiet and peaceful, there was nobody, not a soul around
I laid myself out, I was so tired, and I started to dream
In the mornin' the parkin' tickets were just like rags stuck on my window screen

I said hey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud
Hey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud
Hey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud
Don't hang around 'cause two's a crowd on my cloud, baby

Hey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud
Hey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud
Hey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud
Don't hang around, baby two's a crowd on my cloud, baby
