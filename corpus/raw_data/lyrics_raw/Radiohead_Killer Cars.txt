Killer cars ... cars
Killer cars

Too hard on the brakes again
What if these brakes just give in?
What if they don't get outta the way?
What if there's someone overtaking?

I'm going out for a little drive, and it could be the last time you see me alive
There could be an idiot on the road
The only kick in life is pumping that steel

Wrap me up in the back of the trunk, packed with foam and blind drunk
They won't ever take me alive
'cause they all drive ...

Don't die on the motorway
The moon would freeze, the plants would die
I couldn't cope if you crashed today
All the things I forgot to say

I'm going out for a little drive, and it could be the last time you see me alive
What if that car loses control?
What if there's someone overtaking?

Wrap me up in the back of the trunk, packed with foam and blind drunk
They won't ever take me alive
'cause they all drive ...

Killer cars ...

Wrap me up in the back of a trunk, packed with foam and blind drunk
They won't ever take me alive, cause they all drive killer cars
They all drive ... killer cars
They all drive ... killer cars
