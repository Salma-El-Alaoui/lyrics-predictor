Sweet emotion
Sweet emotion

You talk about things and nobody cares
You're wearing other things that nobody wears
You're calling my name but I gotta make it clear
I can't say baby where I'll be in a year

Some sweat hod mama with a face like a gent
Said, "My 'get up and go' must have got up and went"
Well I got good news, she's a real good liar
'Cause the backstage boogie set your pants on fire

Sweet emotion
Sweet emotion

I pulled into town in a police car
Your daddy said I took it just a little too far
You tellin' me things but your girlfriend lied
You can't catch me 'cause the rabbit done died
Yes it did

You stand in the front just a-shakin' your ass
I'll take you backstage, you can drink from my glass
I talk about something you can sure understand
'Cause a month on the road and I'll be eatin' from your hand
