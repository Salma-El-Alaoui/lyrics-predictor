(Do the rudebox
Shake your rudebox
Do the rudebox
Shake your rudebox)

OK then, back to basics
Grab your shell toes and your fat laces
A little hand clap for some funk faces
And make your body move in the following places
Goes up your back and then down your spine
And when it hits your head…

OK then, back to bass-heads
Dance like you just won at the Special Olympics
They got the rudebox off the back of a spaceship
So sick I just had to take it
The R-U-D-E-B-O-X
Up your jacksy, split your kecks,
Sing a song of semtex
Pocket full of Durex
Body full of Mandrax
Are we gonna have sex (yes)
Do you wear your knee socks (ohh)
Back to the rudebox

Got this double fantasy
Where we just never stop
I’ve got one design
And that’s to funk you to the top
Know what’s on my mind,
It’s only one thing you will find
I got one design
And that’s to bump you till you drop

Rudebox
Do the rudebox
'Cause you so nasty
Rudebox
Shake your rudebox
Why you so nasty?
Rudebox
Do the rudebox
'Cause you so nasty
Rudebox
Shake your rudebox
Why you so nasty?

OK then, back to spaceship
Take both pills, f.uck the Matrix
Jack those Jills, shake your Playtex
Rock three stripes, not the Asics
A-D-I-D-A-S old school, 'cause it’s the best
(Yes)
TK Maxx cost less
(Yes)
Jackson looks a mess
(Bless)

OK then, what to do
If you try to jack me I’ll rudebox you
If you rudebox me I’ll rudebox your whole crew
'Cause it’s what I do
Ain’t that right boo (true)

I’ll ride with you
If you can get me to the border
'Cause the sheriff’s after me
For what I did to his daughter
I did it like this
(You did it like that)
I love it when you double clap (clap)

Got this double fantasy
Where we just never stop
I’ve got one design
And that’s to funk you to the top
Know what’s on my mind,
It’s only one thing you will find
I got one design
And that’s to bump you till you drop

Rudebox
Do the rudebox
'Cause you so nasty
Rudebox
Shake your rudebox
Why you so nasty?
Rudebox
Do the rudebox
'Cause you so nasty
Rudebox
Shake your rudebox
Why you so nasty?

OK then, check the tan line
Make your body shape
Like you’re stood on a land mine
Call me on my mobile
Not the land line
And jack the main line
At the same time

OK, this is what we do
Got a jam so fresh
It’s nice for you
OK, give me what you got
And dial 808
For the bass to drop
OK then, what’s the fracas
Grab your cardy
Your lead hat and the bus pass
You don’t sweat much
For a fat lass
Grab your rudebox
’Cause your box is righteous
OK bum, rush the show
I got high speed dubbing on my stereo
And all the tunes in the box are the cherrio
I know I told you before,
Did you hear me though

Got this double fantasy
Where we just never stop
I’ve got one design
And that’s to funk you to the top
Know what’s on my mind,
It’s only one thing you will find
I got one design
And that’s to bump you till you drop

Rudebox
Do the rudebox
’Cause you so nasty
Rudebox
Shake your rudebox
Why you so nasty?
Rudebox
Do the rudebox
’Cause you so nasty
Rudebox
Shake your rudebox
Why you so nasty?

Do the rudebox
Shake your rudebox
