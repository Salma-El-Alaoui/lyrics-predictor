Hey!!!!
Do your thing honey!

I could feel it from the start,
Couldn't stand to be apart.
Something 'bout you caught my eye,
Something moved me deep inside
Don't know what you did boy but you had it
And I've been hooked ever since.

I told my mother, my brother, my sister and my friends
Told the others, my lovers, both past and present tense.
That everytime I see you everything starts making sense.

Do your thing honey!

Ain't no other man can stand up next to you
Ain't no other man on the planet does what you do
(what you do!)
You're the kinda guy, a girl finds in a blue moon. (hey)
You got soul (yeah), you got class (ohh). You got style, you bad ass (Oh Yeah!)
Ain't no other man it's true (all right)
Ain't no other man but you.

Never thought I'd be alright. No, no, no!
'Til you came and changed my life. Yeah, yeah, yeah!
What was cloudy now is clear! Yeah, yeah!
You're the light that I needed.

You got what I want boy, and I want it!
So keep on givin' it up!

So tell your mother, your brother, your sister, and your friends.
Tell the others, your lovers, better not be present tense.
Cause I want everyone to know that you are mine and no one else's!

Ooooh,oh oh!

Ain't no other man can stand up next to you (to you yeah)
Ain't no other man (ain't no other man) on the planet does what you do

Ain't no other, I, I, I need no other!
