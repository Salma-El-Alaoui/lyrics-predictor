From the top to the bottom, bottom to top I stop
At the core I've forgotten in the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety, the picture's there
The memory won't escape me but why should I care
From the top to the bottom, bottom to top I stop
At the core I've forgotten in the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety, the picture's there
The memory won't escape me but why should I care

There is a place so dark, you can't see the end
Skies cock back and shock that which can't defend
The rain then sends dripping, acidic questions
Forcefully, the power of suggestion
Then with the eyes shut
Looking through the rust and rot and dust
A small spot of light floods the floor and pours over the rusted world of pretend
And the eyes ease open and it's dark again

From the top to the bottom, bottom to top I stop
At the core I've forgotten in the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety, the picture's there
The memory won't escape me but why should I care

In the memory you'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up

Moving all around, screaming of the ups and downs
Pollution manifested in perpetual sound, the wheels go round
And the sunset creeps behind street lamps
Chain links and concrete
A little piece of paper with a picture drawn
Floats on down the street until the wind is gone
The memory now is like the picture was then
When the paper is crumpled up, it can't be perfect again

From the top to the bottom, bottom to top I stop
At the core I've forgotten, in the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety, the picture's there
The memory won't escape me but why should I care
From the top to the bottom, bottom to top I stop
At the core I've forgotten, in the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety, the picture's there
The memory won't escape me but why should I care

In the memory you'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up

Now you've got me caught in the act
You bring the thought back
I'm telling you that
I see it right through you

Now you've got me caught in the act
You bring the thought back
I'm telling you that
I see it right through you

Now you've got me caught in the act
You bring the thought back
I'm telling you that
I see it right through you

Now you've got me caught in the act
You bring the thought back
I'm telling you that
I see it right through you

Now you've got me caught in the act
You bring the thought back
I'm telling you that
I see it right through you

Now you've got me caught in the act
You bring the thought back
I'm telling you that
I see it right through you

Now you've got me caught in the act
You bring the thought back
I'm telling you that
I see it right through you

In the memory you'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up

In the memory you'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up
