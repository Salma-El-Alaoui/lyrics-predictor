Shed my skin since you came in,
where do you end and I begin?
awoke my senses yet you stopped time,
you took me to a deeper high,
the essence of my hopes and fears,
creation of my muddled dreams

Cowboy Style,
with a peaceful smile,
you are from the temple won't you stay a while

Found my voice to have my say,
you take me close to far away,
and now I find and now I feel,
the ordinary is surreal,
peace and terror all in one,
my future life has just begun

Cowboy style,
with a peaceful smile,
you are from the temple won't you stay a while (x2)

Won't you stay a while

I am frightened I'm aroused,
I'm enlightened to the now

Cowboy style (x2)

Cowboy style,
with a peaceful smile,
you are from the temple won't you stay a while
