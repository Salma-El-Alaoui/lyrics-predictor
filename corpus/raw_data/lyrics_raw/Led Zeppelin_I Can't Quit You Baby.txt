Ah, ah
I can't quit you, babe
So I'm gonna put you down for awhile
I said I can't quit you, babe
I guess I got to put you down for awhile
Said you messed up my happy home
Made me mistreat my only child
Yes you did babe, oh

Said you know I love you, baby
My love for you, I could never hide
Oh, you know I love you, babe
My love for you, I could never hide
A-when I feel you near me little girl
I know you are my one desire
Whoa, oh, oh yeah

When you hear me moanin' an' groanin, babe
You know it hurts me deep down inside
Oh, when you hear me moanin' an' groanin', babe
You know it hurts me deep down inside
Oh, when you hear me, honey baby
You know you're my one desire
Yes, you are
Oh, you are
