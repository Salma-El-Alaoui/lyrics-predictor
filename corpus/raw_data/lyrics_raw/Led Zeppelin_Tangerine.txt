Measuring a summer's day
I only find it slips away to grey
The hours, they bring me pain

Tangerine, Tangerine
Living reflections from a dream
I was her love, she was my queen
And now a thousand years between

Thinking how it used to be
Does she still remember times like these?
To think of us again, and I do

Tangerine, Tangerine
Living reflections from a dream
I was her love, she was my queen
And now a thousand years between
