I open up my head inside
And find another person's mind
I'm gonna take this chance I've got
I run denying as we speak
Hiding my face among the weak
Some say their day is on the way

Into the wild
I'm with a mission
Over the hill
Come here with me

Into the wild
Into the wild

High above the serpentine
I cross below the well-worn lines
Entangled in a missing memory
I've had an oversight
I formed this sword that will give rise
To something some new world is here to seize

Into the wild
Into the wild

I love you this is a dream
I'm starting it's easy to see
To find someone else
someone who believes
And I know it
I see what you mean

Into the wild
I'm with a mission
Over the hill
Come here with me

Into the wild
I'm with a mission
Over the hill
Come here with me
