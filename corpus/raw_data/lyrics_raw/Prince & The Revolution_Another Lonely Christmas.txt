Last night I spent another lonely Christmas
Darling, darling, u should've been there
Cuz all the 1s I dream about
U are the 1 that makes my love shout
U see, u are the only 1 I care 4 Remember the time we swam naked
In your father's pool?
Boy he was upset that night
But boy was that ever cool Remember the night we played pokeno 4 money
And u robbed me blind
Remember how u used 2 scream so loud
Cuz u hated that number 9 Hey, I saw your sister skating on the lake
This afternoon
Good Heaven how she's grown
She swoons the boy skaters she's so tall But of all your father's children
All your father's children, baby
U know, u are the finest of them all
U are brighter than the northern star Last night I spent another lonely Christmas
Darling, darling, u, u should've been there
U see, of all the 1s I dream about
U are the 1 that makes my love shout
U see, u are the only 1 I care 4
Yeah My momma used 2 say
Always trust your lover
Now I guess that only applies 2 her Cuz baby u promised me
Baby u promised me u'd never leave
Then u died on the 25th day of December
Oh baby Last night I spent another lonely, lonely Christmas
Darling, baby, u, u should've been there
Cuz all the 1s I dream about
U are the 1 that makes my love shout
U see, u are the only 1 I care 4
Yeah Your father said it was pnemonia
Your mother said it was strep
But the doctor said u were dead
And I, I say its senseless Every Christmas night 4 7 years now
I drink banana daquaris 'til I'm blind
As long as I can hear u smilin' baby
U won't hear my tears
Another lonely Christmas is mine
Yeah, mine
Yeah
Another lonely Christmas is mine Last night, yeah, I spent another lonely, lonely Christmas
Darling, darling, u should've been there, yeah
Cuz all the 1's I dream about
U are the 1 that makes my love shout
U see, u are the only 1 I care 4 Another Lonely
