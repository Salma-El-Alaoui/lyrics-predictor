It's cold outside
It gets so hot in here
And the boys and girls collide
To the music in my ear

Hear the children crying
And I know it's time to go
I hear the children crying
Take me home

A painted face
And I know we haven't long
We thought that we had the answers
It was the questions we had wrong

Hear the children crying
And I know it's time to go
I hear the children crying
Take me home

Sad song, sad song
Sad song, sad song

La lah la la, la lah la la
La lah la
La lah la la la la
La lah la la, lah lah la

La lah la la, la lah la la
La lah la
La lah la la la la
La lah la la, lah lah la

Same song, sad song
Same song, sad song
Oh, same, oh

Call out your name
Call out in shame
Call out your name
Call out
You better call out
Call, call, call out
