I want you to remember, First kiss you ever had, When our lips met together
I knew that was that, I'm still standing, Keeping you dancing yeah, You know
You want it, I'm still going, Making the party blow, The way you like it, Do
You wanna hear me sing Pop, 'cause I don't think I wanna Stop, And I love it
When my beats Drop, Yeah it makes me feel Hot, Guess whose back on top, I'll
Happily surrender, To your desire, A touch so warm and tender, Is setting me
On fire, Funkin to this sound, We're gonna get down, Pop, Stop, Drop, Hot
