So I run and hide and tear myself up
Start again with a brand new name
And eyes that see into infinity

I will disappear
I told you once and I'll say it again
I want my message read clear
I'll show you the way, the way I'm going

So I run and hide and tear myself up
Start again with a brand new name
And eyes that see into infinity

I was almost there
Just a moment away from becoming unclear
Ever get the feeling you're gone?
I'll show you the way, the way I'm going

So I run and hide and tear myself up
Start again with a brand new name
And eyes that see into infinity (into infinity)

So I run, start again
With a brand new name
With a brand new name

So I run and hide and tear myself (so I run)
Start again with a brand new name (start again)
And eyes that see into infinity (with a brand new name)

I will disappear
