Beyonc√© - Freakum Dress
Album: B'Day

(Intro)
To be or not to be
Not!

Hold Up - bring the beat back

Stop - I ain't ready yet

Wait - let me fix my hair (yes, yes)

Yes mam (yes mam)
Yes (So now pass me my dress)

(Verse 1)
I think I'm ready
Been locked up in the house way too long,
It's time to get it,
Cause once again he's out doing wrong,
And my girls are so real,
Said it's been a minute since I had some
He's been acting up, but he won't be the only one

(Oh) Cause when he acts wrong(Oh) is when you put it on,
(Oh) Get him uptight (Oh) this is your song
(Oh) Poke out your back (Oh) time to impress
(Oh) Pull out your freakum dress

(Chorus)
Oooh put your freakum dress on Oooh put your freakum dress on
Oooh put your freakum dress on Oooh put your freakum dress on
Oooh Every woman got one Oooh Shut it down for when the time comes
Oooh So pull out the big gun Oooh and put your freakum dress on

(Verse 2)
Soon as you saw me, turned on by how the dress was fitting right


Short and backless (backless, backless)
See my silhouette in the moonlight
Such an attraction, keep telling me how my outfit's so nice
Little did he know, Ha my man gonna take it off tonight

(Oh) Cause when he acts wrong (Oh) is when you put it on,
(Oh) Get him uptight (Oh) this is your song
(Oh) Poke out your back (Oh) time to impress
(Oh) Pull out your freakum dress

(Chorus)
Oooh put your freakum dress on Oooh put your freakum dress on
Oooh put your freakum dress on Oooh put your freakum dress on
Oooh Every woman got one Oooh Shut it down for when the time comes
Oooh So pull out the big gun Oooh and put your freakum dress on

All the ladies (oh) you wicked all dressed up in your dresses, and your bestest for no reason. Get ready to freakum freakum

When you put it on it's an invitation, when they play your the song get on up and shake it,
Pokin' out on your back you don't have to waste it,
Spinin' all around then take it to the ground and (2x)

(Oh) Cause when he acts wrong (Oh) is when you put it on,
(Oh) Get him uptight (Oh) this is your song
(Oh) Poke out your back (Oh) time to impress
(Oh) Pull out your freakum dress

(Chorus)
Oooh put your freakum dress on Oooh put your freakum dress on
