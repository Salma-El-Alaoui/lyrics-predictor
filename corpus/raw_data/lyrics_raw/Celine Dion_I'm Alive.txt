(Words and music by Kristian Lundin, Andreas Carlsson)


Mmmmm ... Mmmmm ...
Mmmmmmmmmmmm
I get wings to fly
Oh, oh ... I'm alive ...
Yeah

When you call on me
When I hear you
Breathe
I get wings to fly
I feel that I’m alive

When you look at me
I can touch the sky
I know that I’m alive
Mmmmm Ohhhhh Ahhhhhh

When you bless
The day
I just drift away
All my worries die
I’m glad that I’m
Alive

You’ve set my heart
On fire
Filled me with love
Made me a woman on
Clouds above

I couldn’t get
Much higher
My spirit takes flight
Cause I am alive
OHHHHH

When you call on me
When you call on me
When I hear you Breathe
When I hear you breathe
I get wings to fly
(Fly)
I feel that I’m alive
(I'm alive)

When you reach
For me
Raising spirits high
God knows that

That I’ll be the one
Standing by

Through good and
Through
Trying times

And it’s only begun
I can’t wait for the
Rest of my life

When you call on me
When you call on me
When you reach for me
When you reach for me
I get wings to fly
I feel thatI'm alive
Yeah

When you bless
The day
I just drift away
All my worries die
I know that I’m alive

I get
Wings to fly
God knows that I’m alive
