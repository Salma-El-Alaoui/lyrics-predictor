Someone told me it's all happening at the zoo.
I do believe it, I do believe it's true.

Its a light-and-tumble journey from the East Side to the park,
Just a fine and fancy ramble to the zoo.
But you can take the crosstown bus if it's rainin' or it's cold,
And the animals will love it if you do...
(If you do, now...)

Something tells me it's all happening at the zoo.
I do believe it, I do believe it's true.

The monkeys stand for honesty, giraffes are insincere,
And the elephants are kindly but they're dumb.
Orangutans are skeptical of changes in their cages,
And the zookeeper is very fond of rum.

Zebras are reactionaries, antelopes are missionaries,
Pigeons blocked in secrecy, and hamsters turn on frequently,
(what the...)
Guess you'll have to come and see at the zoo,
At the zoo, at the zoo, at the zoo, at the zoo.
