So you want to be free
To live your life the way you wanna be
Will you give if we cry
Will we live or will we die

Tainted hearts heal with time
Shoot bad love so we can
Stop the bleeding

Solitary brother, is there still a part of you that
Wants to live
Solitary sister, is there still a part of you that
Wants to give
Solitary brother, is there still a part of you that
Wants to live
Solitary sister, is there still a part of you that
Wants to give

If we try to live our lives
The way we wanna be

Solitary brother, is there still a part of you that
Wants to live
Solitary sister, is there still a part of you that
Wants to give
Solitary brother, is there still a part of you that
Wants to live
Solitary sister, is there still a part of you that
Wants to give

Racism in future kings can only lead to no good
And besides, all our sons and daughters already
Know that feels

It was the third of september
That day I?ll always remember, yes I will
Ã‚'Cause that was the day that my daddy died

Never had a chance to see him, no
Never heard nothin? but bad things about him
Mama, I?m depending on you to tell me the truth
Mama just hung her head and said

(Chorus)

Papa was a rollin? stone
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
(And when he died)
All he left us was alone (repeat)

Hey, mama, is it true what they say
That papa never worked a day in his life
Some bad talks going around sayin?
Papa had three outside children
And anouther wife
That ain?t right

Heard some talks about papa and his storefront
Preachin?
Talkin? about saving souls and all the time
Leaching
And dealing in the dirt
Stealin? in the name of the lord
But mama she just said

(Chorus)

Papa was a rollin? stone
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
(And when he died)
All he left us was alone (repeat)

Say, I heard my papa was a jack of all trades
Is that what sent papa to an early grave?
Folks say papa would bag, borrow of steal just
To pay his bills
Hey, mama, folks say papa was ever much on thinkin?
Spent most of this time chasin? women and drinkin?
But mouther, I?m depending on you to tell me the truth
But my mama she just said

(Chorus 2x)

Papa was a rollin? stone
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
(And when he died)
All he left us was alone (repeat)

But my mama she said

Papa was a rollin? stone
Oh my mama said
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died
All he left us was alone (repeat)

All he left us
All he left us

Can you believe he left us?

All alone yeah
All alone yeah
All alone yeah

Yeah
