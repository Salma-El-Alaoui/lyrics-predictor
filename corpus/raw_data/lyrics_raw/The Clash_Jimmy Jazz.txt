The police walked in for Jimmy Jazz
I said, he ain't here, but he sure went past

Sattamassagana for Jimmy Dread
Cut off his ears and chop off his head
Police came looking for Jimmy Jazz

Maybe put it down somewhere over the other side
See it gets to Jimmy Jazz

You can try your luck, brother, see what you found
But I guarantee you that it ain't your day
Your time, it ain't your day

Chop! Chop!
