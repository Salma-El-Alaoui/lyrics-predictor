Five o'clock in the morning you ain't home
I can't help thinking that's strange
Baby I just want you to know I won't go through this again
Yes, those clouds are closing in

Chorus:
And I will not accept this as a part of my life
I will not live in fear of what may be
And the lessons that I learned
I would rather be alone than watch you spinning that wheel for me
You've got a thing about danger
Ain't you getting what you want from me
You've got a thing about strangers
Baby that's what we used to be
You've got a thing about danger baby
I guess the hungry just can't see
One of these days you gonna bring some home to me

Six o'clock in the morning you ain't home
I can't help thinking it's strange
It seems that everybody takes their chances these days
Oh yeah, we're standing in the rain

Chorus

How can you love me when you're playing with my life
You say give me time and I'll do better I swear
Give me time and I'll lead you back to despair
And I don't want to go back there
