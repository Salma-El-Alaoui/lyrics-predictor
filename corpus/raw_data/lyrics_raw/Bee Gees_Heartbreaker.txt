got to say it and it's hard for me
You got me cryin' like I thought I would never be
Love is believin' but you let me down
How can I love you when you ain't around
And I .....

Get to the morning and you never call
Love should be ev'rything or not at all
And it don't matter what ever you do
I made a life out of lovin' you

Only to find any dream that I follow is dying
I'm cryin' in the rain
I could be searchin' my world for a love everlasting
Feeling no pain, when will we meet again

Why do you have to be a heartbreaker
Is it a lesson that I never knew
Gotta get out of the spell that I'm under
My love for you
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker
When I was bein' what you want me to be
Suddenly ev'rything I ever wanted has passed me by
This world may end
Not you and I

My love is stronger than the universe
My soul is cryin' for you
And that can not be reversed
You made the rules but you could not see
You made a life out of hurtin' me

Out of my mind ,
I am held by the power of you love
Tell me when do we try
Why should we say goodbye

Ohhh,
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker
When I was bein' what you want me to be
Suddenly ev'rthing I ever wanted has passed me by

Ohhh,
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker
Is it a lesson that I never knew
Suddenly ev'rthing I ever wanted my love for you

Why do you have to be a heartbreaker
When I was bein' what you want me to be
Suddenly ev'rthing I ever wanted has passed me by
