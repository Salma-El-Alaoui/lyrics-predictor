[Both:]
There was a time when we were down and out
There was a place when we were starting over
We let the bough break
We let the heartache in
Who's sorry now
Who's sorry now

[Barbra:]
There was a world when we were standing still
And for a moment we were separated
And then you found her
You let the stranger in
Together
Who's sorry now

[Barbra:]
Who's sorry now
What , what kind of fool
Tears it apart
Leaving me pain and sorrow

[Barry:]
Losing you now
Wonderin' why
Where will I be tomorrow

Chorus
Forever more that's what we are to be
Without each other
We'll be remembering when...

[Both:]
There was a time when we were down and out
(We cried)
There was a place when we were starting over
(We lied)
We let the bough break
We let the heartache in
Who's sorry now
Who's sorry now

[Barbra:]
What , what kind of fool

[Barry:]
What , what kind of fool

[Barbra:]
Tears it apart

[Barry:]
Tears it apart

[Barbra:]
Leaving me pain and sorrow

[Barry:]
Oh! Losing you now
How can I win
Where will I be tomorrow

[Barbra:]
Was there a moment when I cut you down
Played around
What have I done
I only apologize
For being as they say, the last to know
It has to show
When someone is in your eyes

[Both:]
What, what kind of fool
Tears it apart
Leaving me pain and sorrow
Losing you now
Wondering why
Where will I be tomorrow
What, what kind of fool
Tears it apart
Leaving me pain and sorrow
Losing you now
How can I win
Where will I be tomorrow
