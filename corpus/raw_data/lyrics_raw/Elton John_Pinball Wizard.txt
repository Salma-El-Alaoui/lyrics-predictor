Ever since I was a young boy I played the silver ball
From Soho down to Brighton I must have played 'em all
But I ain't seen nothin' like him in any amusement hall
That deaf, dumb and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball

He stands like a statue, becomes part of the machine
Feelin' all the bumpers, always playin' clean
He plays by intuition, the digit counters fall
That deaf, dumb and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball

He's a pinball wizard, there has to be a twist
A pinball wizard's got such a supple wrist
How do you think he does it? - I don't know
What makes him so good?

Well, he ain't got no distractions, can't hear no buzzes or bells
Don't see no lights a-flashin', he plays by sense of smell
Always have a replay, never tilts at all
That deaf, dumb and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball

He can't beat me now, I've always been the champ
I know every trick, no freak's gonna beat my hand

Even on my usual table, he can beat the best
His disciples lead him in and he just does the rest
He's got crazy flipper fingers, I've never seen him fall
That deaf, dumb and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball.

He's a pinball wizard, there has to be a twist
A pinball wizard's got such a supple wrist

He's a pinball wizard, he scores a trillion more
A Pinball Wizard, the world's new pinball lord
He's scoring more, he's scoring more

I thought I was the Bally table king
But I just handed my pinball crown to him
To him, to him!
