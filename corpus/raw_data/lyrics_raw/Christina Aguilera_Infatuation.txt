He comes from a foreign place
From an island far away
Intrigues me with every move
Till I'm breathless, I'm helpless
Can't keep my cool
Steals my heart when he takes my hand
And we dance, to the rhythm of the band
I feel his finger tips, grip my hips
And I slip as we dip into a state of bliss

Mama used to warn me
To beware of those Latin lovers
She said I gave my heart too soon
And that's how I became your mother
I said ay mama, you seem to forget
I'm not in love yet
Sweet talk don't win me over
But I realized
Big brown eyes can hypnotize
When he says

Chorus:
I am full blood boricua
Reads the tattoo on his arm
He tells me, mami I need ya
And my heartbeat pumps so strong
Getting lost in el ritmo
He whispers te quiero, te quiero
I begin to give in with no hesitation
Can't help my infatuation
It's pure infatuation

Skin the color of cinnamon
His eyes light up and I melt within
Feels so good it must be a sin
I can't stop what I started
I'm giving in
He brings life to my fantasies
Sparks a passion inside of me
Finds the words when I can not speak
In the silence, his heartbeat is music to me

But Mama used to warn me
Not to rush love with another
She said I'm not trying to lecture
I just care about my daughter
Ay mama, you seem to forget
I never will let
A man control my emotions
But when he smiles (when he smiles)
I feel like a little child
When he says

(Chorus)

Caught between my mama's words
And what I feel inside
I'm wanting to explore his world
But part of me wants to hide
Should I risk it, can't resist it
This has caught me by surprise
Should I, let him take me to Puerto Rico
I can't hold back no more
Let's go tonight...

Papi hold me, say that you adore me
Never let go never leave me lonely

(Chorus)

I can't help what I'm feeling
I'm infatuated (It's pure infatuation)
(Can't help my infatuation)
Papi hold me, say that you adore me
Never let go never leave me lonely

It's pure infatuation
