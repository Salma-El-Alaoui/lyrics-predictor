I get up around seven
Get outta bed around nine
And I don't worry about nothin', no
'Cause worryin's a waste of my... time

The show usually starts around seven
We go on stage around nine
Get on the bus about eleven
Sippin' a drink and feelin' fine

We been dancin' with Mr. Brownstone
He's been knockin'
He won't leave me alone
No, no ,no, he won't leave me alone

I used to do a little but a little wouldn't do it
So the little got more and more
I just keep tryin' to get a little better
Said a little better than before
I used to do a little but a little wouldn't do it
So the little got more and more
I just keep tryin' to get a little better
Said a little better than before

We been dancin' with Mr. Brownstone
He's been knockin'
He won't leave me alone
No, no ,no, he won't leave me alone

Now I get up around whenever
I used to get up on time
But that old man, he's a real motherfucker
Gonna kick him on down the line

I used to do a little but a little wouldn't do it
So the little got more and more
I just keep tryin' to get a little better
Said a little better than before
I used to do a little but a little wouldn't do it
So the little got more and more
I just keep tryin' to get a little better
Said a little better than before

We been dancin' with Mr. Brownstone
He's been knockin'
He won't leave me alone
No, no ,no, he won't leave me alone, never
Oh, leave me alone

Stuck it in the bindle and I shot it in the middle
And it, it drove outta my mind
I should've known better, said I wish I never met her
Said I, I leave it all behind
Yowsa
