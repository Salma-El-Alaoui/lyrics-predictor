Where are U?
U can relax now, the max is in control, uh
I Go (this is something 4 nothing), ah yeah yeah

When my back is so far back it's on the other side of the wall
When half a chance is all I get, if I get a chance at all
When the going gets tougher than the tough can go
I grind the ax - that's when I go, I go, I go 2 the max, I go

The max-- yo baby, tell me where the party's at (This is something)
The max-- yo baby, I wanna shuffle the cards in that stack (I go)
The max - we can dance if U want 2 but I might break your back (Yeah) (This is something)
The max -- MO 4 4 your buck U can bet on that

When they tell me 2 walk a straight line
I put on crooked shoes
When they tell me that I can't live 4ever
I pay some overdues (Dig it)
When they start making up a crazy rule
That's when I break a back, cuz (Break a back)
When I go, I go, I go 2 the max, I go

The max-- yo baby, tell me where the party's at (This is something)(Oh Yeah)
The max-- yo baby, I wanna shuffle the cards in that stack (Ah yeah yeah) (Yeah)
The max - we can dance if U want 2 but I might break your back (This is something)(Yeah)
The max -- MO 4 4 your buck U can bet on that

(Let's go {x4) (Oow) (Ah yeah yeah)

When my body starts 2 shiver from the chill of a scarlet sweat (Dig it)
When my lips eclipse the sun and the moon reflecting from the wet
When the blood of my love outraces everyone of the stallions in your pack
That's when U go, U go, U go 2 the max

U go, (The max, the max) (Oh get funky)
(The max) (Git, git, git funky) (Oow)
(The max) (Get funky) (Let's go)

I think I'm gonna like this (Let's go {x2}) (Dance)
I wanna dance (Let's go {x2}) (Ah yeah yeah)
I go 2 the max I'm not afraid (Oh my God!)
I wanna dance (Hey listen)

When the going gets tougher than tough can go I grind the ax
That's when I go, I go, I go 2 the max...I go

The max-- yo baby, tell me where the party's at(This is something)
The max-- yo baby, I wanna shuffle the cards in that stack
The max - we can dance if U want 2 but I might break your back (This is something)
The max -- MO 4 4 your buck U can bet on that
This is the max

Dear love, dear love, dear love forgive me 4 my sins
But U left me such a cold cold world 2 suffer in (Dig it)
And contrary 2 popular belief even though one's life is brief
If U go there once U'll come again and again and again and a (Let's go)

(When some something...)
This is the max
