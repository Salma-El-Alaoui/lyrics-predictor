I-I-I I wouldn't change
I-I-I I wouldn't change
I-I-I I wouldn't change
I-I-I I wouldn't change
I-I-I I wouldn't change

Some people don't understand
What I see in you
If only they knew
They think my head's in the sand
They'll never see
The best side of you
Is my heart ruling my mind
Maybe I'm not right every time
But I know I'm right about this love of mine

CHORUS:
If I had to do it all again
I wouldn't change a single thing
There's no questioning in my heart
When it comes to our love
I wouldn't change a thing

Yeah, I've had my doubts
My ups and downs
On the merry-go-round
They say my heads in the cloud
But I'm keeping one
Foot on the ground
I know they say love is blind
But he's the best thing that happened to me
And I'm not ashamed for the world to see

CHORUS:

I-I-I I wouldn't change
I-I-I I wouldn't change
I-I-I I wouldn't change
I-I-I I wouldn't change

Is my heart ruling my mind
Maybe I'm not right on every thing
But I know I'm right about this love of mine

CHORUS:
repeat & fade
