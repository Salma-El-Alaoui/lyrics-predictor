Burn all the candles out
Make a wish but not aloud
Relive the here and now
See you now and then
I'm a revolvin' door
I've seen it all before
I will begin again
But I can't start until I've seen the end

I took a look around
I believe in hand me down
The treasure's all we've found
When we were brand new
Now that we're old and worn
A little ripped and torn
One day we'll be reborn
One day I will meet you right back here
Once again
Wait
Stop me so I can begin

End over end x3
I'm circling
End over end x3
I'm circling

I'm feelin' out of luck
Maybe I just feel too much
That old familiar touch
Always stained my skin
The good in everyone
The ties we left undone
The heart that moves your blood
All the things that bring me right back here
Once again
Wait
Stop me so I can begin

End over end x3
I'm circling
End over end x3
I'm circling
End over end x3
I'm circling
End over end x3
I'm circling, Im circling
Hey
Once again
Wait
Stop me so I can begin

End over end x3
I'm circling
End over end x3
I'm circling
End over end x3
I'm circling
End over end x3
I'm circling, I'm circling
I'm circling, I'm circling
I'm circling
