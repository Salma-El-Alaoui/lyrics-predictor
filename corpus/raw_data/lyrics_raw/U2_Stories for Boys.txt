There's a place I go
When I am far away.
There's a T.V. show
And I can play.

Sometimes when a hero takes me
Sometimes I don't let go
Oh, oh, oh.

There's a picture book
With colour photographs
There's a comic strip
That makes me laugh

Sometimes away he takes me
Sometimes I don't let go.

There's a place I go
And it's a part of me
There's a radio
And I will go

Sometimes a hero takes me
Sometimes I don't let go.
