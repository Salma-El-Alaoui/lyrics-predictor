Lie awake in bed at night
And think about your life
Do you want to be different?
Try to let go of the truth
The battles of your youth
â€™Cause this is just a game

It's a beautiful lie
It's a perfect denial
Such a beautiful lie to believe in
So beautiful, beautiful it makes me

It's time to forget about the past
To wash away what happened last
Hide behind an empty face
Don't ask too much, just say
'Cause this is just a game

It's a beautiful lie
It's a perfect denial
Such a beautiful lie to believe in
So beautiful, beautiful it makes me

Lie....Beautiful

Everyone's looking at me
I'm running around in circles (baby)
A quiet desperation's building higher
I've got to remember this is just a game

So beautiful, beautiful...

(It's a beautiful lie
Beautiful, beautiful
It's a beautiful lie
Beautiful, beautiful
It's a beautiful lie
Beautiful, beautiful)

It's a beautiful lie
It's a perfect denial
Such a beautiful lie to believe in
So beautiful, beautiful it makes me

(Shoots himself)
