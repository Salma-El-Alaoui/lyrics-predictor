you push me!
to go the extra mile
you push me!
when it's dificult to smile
you push me!
a better version of myself
you push me!
only you and no one else
you push me!
see the other point of view
you push me!
when there's nothing else to do
you push me!
when I think I know it all
You push me!
when I stumble and I fall

keep on pushing
like nobody

every race I win
every mood I'm in
everything I do, I owe it all to you
Every move I make
every step I take
everything I love
it's all because you push me

you push me!
when I don't appreciate
you push me!
not to lie and not to hate
you push me!
when I want it all to end
you push me!
when I really need a friend
you push me!
all I wanna do is cry
you push me!
when It's hard for me to try
you push me!
learn to do it for myself
you push me!
only you and no one else

keep on pushing
like nobody


every race I win
every mood I'm in
everything I do, I owe it all to you
Every move I make
every step I take
everything I do
it's all because you push me
you push me

keep on pushing
like nobody

to go the extra mile
when it's dificult to smile
only you , and only you, and only you
see the other point of view
when there's nothing else to do
when I think I know it all
only you, and only you, and only you

every race I win
every mood I'm in
everything I do, I owe it all to you
Every move I make
every step I take
everything I love
it's all because you push me
you push me
