On and on, reckless abandon
Something's wrong
This is gonna shock them
Nothing to hold on to
We'll use this song
To lead you on

I learned a lot today
Not sure if I'll get laid and
Not sure if I'll fail or pass
Kissed every girl in class

Everybody would waste it all
To have a summer that they could call
A memory that's full of fun
Fucked up when it's all done

On and on, reckless abandon
Something's wrong
This is gonna shock them
Nothing to hold on to
We'll use this song
To lead you on
And break the truth with more bad news.
We left a scar size extra large

Sip a drink of the alcohol
End up kneeling in bathroom stalls
Eyes are red and my movements slow
Too high, got vertigo

He took a shit in the bathroom tub
And fed the dog the brownie drugs
Tried hard to not get caught
He fucked a chick in a parking lot

On and on, reckless abandon
Something's wrong
This is gonna shock them
Nothing to hold on to
We'll use this song
To lead you on
And break the truth with more bad news
We left a scar size extra large

Break a window and bust a wall
Making fun of your friend's mom
Turn the music up way too loud
Charge the pizza to the house

Everybody would waste it all

To have a summer that they could call
Memory that's full of fun
Fucked up when it's all done

On and on, reckless abandon
Something's wrong
This is gonna shock them
Nothing to hold on to
We'll use this song
To lead you on
And break the truth with more bad news
We left a scar size extra large
