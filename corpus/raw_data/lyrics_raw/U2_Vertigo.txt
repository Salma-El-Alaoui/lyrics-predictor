''Unos, dos, tres, catorce!''
Turn it up, there, captain...

Lights go down, it’s dark
The jungle is your head
Can’t rule your heart
A feeling so much stronger than
A thought
Your eyes are wide
And though your soul
It can’t be bought
Your mind can wander

Hello, hello!
''¡Hola, hola!''
I’m at a place called Vertigo!
''¿Donde está?''
It’s everything I wish I didn’t know
Except you give me something I can feel, feel

The night is full of holes
There's bullets ripping sky
Of ink with gold
They twinkle as the
Boys play rock and roll
They know that they can’t dance
At least they know

I can’t stand the beats
I’m asking for the cheque
Girl with crimson nails
Has Jesus 'round her neck
Swinging to the music
Swinging to the music
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh

Hello, hello!
''¡Hola, hola!''
I’m at a place called Vertigo!
''¿Donde está?''
It’s everything I wish I didn’t know
But you give me something I can feel, feel

Checkmated
Just fall
Show meaning, eh, eh

All of this, all of this can be yours
All of this, all of this can be yours
All of this, all of this can be yours
Just give me what I want and no-one gets hurt

Hello, hello!
''¡Hola, hola!''
I'm at a place called Vertigo!
''¿Donde está?''
Lights go down and all I know
Is that you give me something

I can feel your love teaching me how
Your love is teaching me how
How to feel
Kneel

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
