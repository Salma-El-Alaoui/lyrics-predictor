Now every cheap hood strikes a bargain with the world
And ends up making payments on a sofa or a girl
Love 'n' hate tattooed across the knuckles of his hands
The hands that slap his kids around 'cause they don't understand how

''[Chorus:]''
Death or glory becomes just another story
Death or glory becomes just another story

And every gimmick hungry job digging gold from rock 'n' roll
Grabs the mike to tell us he'll die before he's sold
But I believe in this and it's been tested by research
That he who fucks nuns will later join the church

''[Chorus]''

In every dingy basement on every dingy street
Every dragging hand clap over every dragging beat
That's just the beat of time the beat that must go on
If you been trying for years then we already heard your song

''[Chorus]''

Gonna march a long way
Gonna fight a long time
Got to travel over mountains
Got to travel over seas

We're gonna fight you, brother
We're gonna fight till you lose
We're gonna raise trouble
We're gonna raise hell

We're gonna fight you, brother
We're gonna raise hell

''[Chorus]''
