Fine

Excuse me, but uh, what's up with your voice?

It's a special phone - a tongue box.

A tongue box?
Oh, like in the movie "Barbarella"?

Yeah, it gives me courage, U know, like a veil I can hide behind
It talks at, around, through her

OK, so why are U giving me an interview?

Because I want U...

Eh, pardon me?

...2 tell the truth

Oh, well I will if U will
4 example, the first song of your opera

Ah, the opera

Why don't U tell me your real name?

My name is Victor

That is not the truth and U know it
How old are U?

I'm into my 5th soul now so that makes me 3 hundred...

Hmph, why do U pretend 2 be a maze?

How 'bout this 4 a scandal: 320 year old robs a cradle?
Hm mm, what a scandal!

Scandal
