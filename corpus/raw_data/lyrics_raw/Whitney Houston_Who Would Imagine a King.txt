Mommies and Daddies, always believe
That their little angels are special indeed,
And you could grow up to be anything,
But who would imagine a king

A sheperd or teacher, is what you could be
or maybe a fisherman out on the sea
or maybe a carpenter, building things
But who would imagine a king

It was so clear, when the wisemen arrived
and the angels were singing your name,
that the world would be different
cause you were alive
That's why heaven stood still to proclaim

One day an angel, said quietly
that soon he would bring something special to me
and of all of the wonderful gifts he could bring
who would imagine, who could imagine, who would imagine a king

ooooooooooooo
