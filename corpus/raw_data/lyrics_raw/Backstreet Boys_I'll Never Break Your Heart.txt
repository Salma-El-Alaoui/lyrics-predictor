Spoken
Baby I know your hurting
Right now you feel like you could never love again
Now all I ask is for a chance
To prove that I love you

From the first day
That I saw your smiling face
Honey, I knew that we would be together forever
Ooh when I asked you out
You said no but I found out
Darling that you'd been hurt
You felt that you'd never love again
I deserve a try honey just once
Give me a chance and I'll prove this all wrong
You walked in you were so quick to judge
But honey he's nothing like me

Chorus
I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die than live without you
I'll give you all of me
Honey that's no lie (2x)

As time goes by you
will get to know me
A little more better
Girl that's the way love goes
And I know you're afraid (Know your afraid)
To let you're feelings show (feelings show)
And I understand
But girl it's time to let go
I deserve a try honey
Just once
Give me a chance and I'll prove this all wrong
You walked in you were so quick to judge
But honey he's nothing like me
Darling why can't you see

Chorus (2x)

Bridge
No way, no how
I'll never make you cry (2x)

Chorus
