Tryin' to be misunderstood
But it doesn't do me any good
Love the way they smile at me
Held that face for eternity
Now let them all fly off

When it comes down
It all comes down
You will not be found

When its over
It's all over
Even if i make a sound

I'll be misunderstood
By the beautiful and good in...This city
None of it was planned
Take me by the hand
Just dont try and understand

Try to be misunderstood
Just a product of my childhood
And still i find myself outside
You cant say i havent tried
Perhaps i tried too hard

No exscuses
I wont apoligise
Or justify your lies
Come find me
Tell them to me
Look me in the eyes

I'll be misunderstood
By the beautiful and good in...This city
None of this was planned
Take me by the hand
Just dont try and understand

Cant forgive sorry to say
You dont know your guilty anyway
Isnt it funny how we dont speak
The language of love
