It's all your fault, but, I'm gonna try

I'm feelin' as bad about me as you are
You know I don't wanna be here
I'm tryin' to work out where these feelings are from
I don't know why I'm doin' this either

I know, you're right, you win
I don't want any part of it
You know what I'm like, I give in
Even though you started it

Last time I checked, had it under control
But now everything is unclear
Help me correct it, I know that I'm wrong
I don't know why I'm doin' this either

I know, you're right, you win
I don't want any part of it
You know what I'm like, I give in
Even though you started it

Oh well, baby, you were right
Oh, no, no, no, hush, hush, you were right
Forget about it baby, you were right
Yeah, we argue sometimes but please, not tonight

''Hey, you gon' be okay?
Don't worry about it
Sing''

I know, you're right, you win
I don't want any part of it
You know what I'm like, I give in
Even though you started it

I know, you're right, you win
I don't want any part of it
You know what I'm like, I give in
Even though you started it

Yeah
We argue sometimes but
Not tonight, tonight, tonight...
