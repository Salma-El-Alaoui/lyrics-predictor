Smile an everlasting smile
A smile can bring you near to me
Don't ever let me find you gone
'Cause that could bring a tear to me

This world has lost it's glory,
Let's start a brand new story, now my love
Right now there'll be no other time
And I can show you all, my love

Talk in everlasting words
And dedicate them all to me
And I will give you all my life
I'm here if you should call to me

You think that I don't even mean
A single word I say
It's only words and words are all I have
To take your heart away

LaLaDaDaDiaDA....

You think that I don't even mean
A single word I say
It's only words and words are all I have
To take your heart away

It's only words and words are all I have
To take your heart away(X2)
