After all you put me through
You'd think I'd despise you
But in the end I want to thank you
'Cause you made me that much stronger

Well I thought I knew you
Thinking that you were true
I guess I, I couldn't trust
Called your bluff time is up

'Cause I've had enough
You were there by my side
Always down for the ride
But your joy ride just came down in flames
'Cause your greed sold me out in shame

After all of the stealing and cheating
You probably think that
I hold resentment for you
But, uh uh, oh no, you're wrong

'Cause if it wasn't for
All that you tried to do
I wouldn't know just how capable
I am to pull through
So I wanna say thank you 'cause

It makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
It makes me that much wiser
So, thanks for making me a fighter

Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So, thanks for making me a fighter

Never saw it coming
All of your backstabbing
Just so you could cash in
On a good thing before I realized your game

I heard you're going around
Playing the victim now
But don't even begin
Feeling I'm the one to blame
'Cause you dug your own grave

After all of the fights and the lies
Yes, you wanted to harm me
But that won't work anymore
Uh, no more, oh no, it's over

'Cause if it wasn't for all of your torture
I wouldn't know how to be this way now
And never back down
So I wanna say thank you 'cause

It makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
Makes me that much wiser
So, thanks for making me a fighter

Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
It makes me that much smarter
So, thanks for making me a fighter

How could this man I thought I knew
Turn out to be unjust so cruel
Could only see the good in you
Pretended not to see the truth

You tried to hide your lies, disguise yourself
Through living in denial
But in the end you'll see
You won't stop me

I am a fighter and I
I ain't gonna stop
There is no turning back
I've had enough

'Cause it makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
Makes me that much wiser
So, thanks for making me a fighter

Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
It makes me that much smarter
So, thanks for making me a fighter

You thought I would forget,
But, I, I remember
I remember, I remember
You thought I would forget,
But, I, I remember
I remember, I remember

'Cause it makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
Makes me that much wiser
So, thanks for making me a fighter

Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
It makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter
