Reckoner
You can't take it with you
Dancing for your pleasure

You are not to blame for
Bittersweet distractor
Dare not speak its name
Dedicated to all you
All human beings

Because we separate
Like ripples on a blank shore
(In rainbows)
Because we separate
Like ripples on a blank shore
(In rainbows)

Reckoner
Take me with you
Dedicated to all you
All human beings
