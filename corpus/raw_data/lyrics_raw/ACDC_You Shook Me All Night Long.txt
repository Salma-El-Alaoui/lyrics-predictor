She was a fast machine
She kept her motor clean
She was the best damn woman that I ever seen
She had the sightless eyes
Telling me no lies
And knockin' me out with those American thighs
Taking more than her share
Had me fighting for air
She told me to come, but I was already there
'Cause the walls started shaking
The earth was quaking
My mind was aching
And we were making it and

You shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me all night long

Working double time
On the seduction line
She was one of a kind, she's just mine all mine
Wanted no applause
Just another course
Made a meal out of me and come back for more
Had to cool me down
To take another round
Now I'm back in the ring to take another swing
But the walls were shaking
The earth was quaking
My mind was aching
And we were making it and

You shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me all night long
And knocked me out, I said, you shook me all night long
You had me shaking and, you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me
When you took me

You really took me and you shook me all night long
Ah, you shook me all night long
Yeah yeah, you shook me all night long
You really got me and you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me
Yeah, you shook me all night long
