First they ignore you
Then laugh at you and hate you
Then they fight you
Then you win

When the truth dies very bad things happen
They're being heartless again
I know its gone and there's going to be violence
I've taken as much as I'm willing to take
Why do you think we should suffer in silence?
When a heart is broken there's nothing to break

You've been mixing with some very heavy faces
The boys have done a bit of bird
They don't kill their own when they all love their mothers
But you're out of your depth son have a word

I know its gone and there's going to be violence
I've taken as much as I'm willing to take
Why do you think we should suffer in silence?
The heart is broken there's nothing to break

All is wonderful in this life
Dreaming of the sun she warms,
You should see me in the afterlife
Picking up the sons of dust

When you think we're lost we're exploring
What you think is what you're soon adoring
You don't want the truth the truth is boring
I've got this fever, need to
Leave the house
Leave the car
Leave the bad men where they are
I leave a few shells in my gun
N' its Got me staring at the sun....

I know its gone and there's going to be violence
I've taken as much as I'm willing to take
Why do you say we should suffer in silence?
My heart is broken there's nothing to break
