Swaying Room As The Music Starts
Strangers Making The Most Of The Dark
Two By Two Their Bodies Become One

I See You Through The Smokey Air
Can`t You Feel The Weight Of My Stare
You`re So Close,But Still A World Away
What I`m Dying To Say Is That

Chorus:
I`m Crazy For You
Touch Me Once And You Know Its True
I Never Wanted Anyone Like This
Its All Brand New
You`ll Feel It In My Kiss
I`m Crazy For You
Crazy For You

Trying Hard To Control My Heart
I Walk Over To Where You Are
Eye To Eye We Meet No Words At All

Slowly Now We Begin To Move
Every Breth I`m Deeper Into You
Soon We Too Are Standing Still In Time
If You Read My Mind
You See

Chorus(Repeat)
Crazy For You
Crazy For You
Crazy For You
Crazy For You

Its All Brand New
I`m Crazy For You
And You Know Its True
I`m Crazy,Crazy For You
Its All Brand New
I`m Crazy,Crazy For You
And You Know Its True
Yeah I`m Crazy For You
Crazy For You Baby
I`m Crazy For You
Crazy For You Baby
