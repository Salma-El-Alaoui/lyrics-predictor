Come and I'll take you under
This beautiful bruise's colors
Everything fades in time, it's true
Wish that I had another
Stab at the undercover
Was it a change in mind for you

It's impossible
I can't let it out
You'll never know
Am I selling you out
Sit and watch
Your every mood
Mood

Your eyes still remind me of
Angels that hover above
Eyes that can change from blind to blue

It's impossible
I can't let it out
You'll never know
Am I selling you out
Sit and watch
Your every mood
Mood
Mood
Mood

Now that I've found my reward
I'd throw it away long before
I'd share a piece of mine with you

It's impossible
I can't let it out
You'll never know
Am I selling you out
Sit and watch
Your every mood
Mood
Mood
Mood
