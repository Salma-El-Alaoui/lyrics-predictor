I sit alone in my bedroom
Staring at the walls
I've been up all damn night long
My pulse is speeding
My love is yearning

I hold my breath and close my eyes
And dream about her
Cause she's 2000 light years away
She holds my malakite so tight so..
Never let go
Cause she's 2000 Light years away

I sit outside and watch the sunrise
Look out as far as I can
I can't see her, but in the distance
I hear some laughter
We laugh together

Then I hold my breath and close my eyes
And dream about her
Cause she's 2000 light years away.
