If I say I don't need anyone
I can say these things to you
'Cause I can turn on anyone
Just like I turned on you

I've got a tongue like a razor
A sweet switchblade knife
And I can do you favors
But then you'll do whatever I like

Here I am
And you're a Rocket Queen
I might be a little young
But honey I ain't naive

Here I am
And you're a Rocket Queen, oh yeah
I might be too much
But honey you're a bit obscene

I've seen everything imaginable
Pass before these eyes
I've had everything that's tangible
Honey you'd be surprised

I'm a sexual innuendo
In this burned out paradise
If you turn me on to anything
You better turn me on tonight

Here I am
And you're a Rocket Queen
I might be a little young
But honey I ain't naive

Here I am
And you're a Rocket Queen, oh yeah
I might be too much
But honey you're a bit obscene

Here I am
And you're a Rocket Queen
I might be a little young
But honey I ain't naive

Here I am
And you're a Rocket Queen, oh yeah
I might be too much
But honey you're a bit obscene

I see you standing, standing on your own
It's such a lonely place for you, for you to be
If you need a shoulder or if you need a friend
I'll be here standing until the bitter end

No one needs the sorrow
No one needs the pain
I hate to see you
Walking out there, out in the rain

So don't chastise me
Or think I, I mean you harm
Of those that take you
Leave you strung out much too far, baby, yeah

Woah, no, woah, woah, baby, yeah

Don't ever leave me
Say you'll always be there
All I ever wanted
Was for you to know that I care
