(Better the devil you know, better the devil you know)
Woah woah woah woah woah woah woah.

Say you won't leave me no more,
I'll take you back again.
No more excuses, no no,
Cos I've heard them all before,
A hundred times or more.

I'll forgive
And forget
If you say you'll never go,
Cos it's true
What they say
It's better the devil you know.

Our love wasn't perfect I know,
I think you know the score.
When you say you love me, oh boy,
I can't ask for more.
I'll come if you should call.

I'll forgive
And forget
If you say you'll never go.
Cos it's true
What they say
It's better the devil you know.

Woah woah woah woah woah woah woah woah.

Say you won't leave me no more,
I'll take you back again.
No more excuses, no no,
Cos I've heard them all before,
A hundred times or more.

I'll forgive
And forget
If you say you'll never go.
Cos it's true
What they say
It's better the devil you know
I'll be here every day
waiting for your love to show
Cos it's true what they say
It's better the devil you know
