(Intro: Background Voices)

...Nation to nation all the world must come together
Face the problems that we see then maybe somehow we can work it out
I asked my neighbour for a favor she said later
What has come of all the people have we lost love of what it's about
I have to find my peace 'cause no one seems to let me be
Fal' prophets cry of doom what are the possibilities
I told my brother there'll be problem time and tears for fears
We must leave each day like is today

Go with it go with it
Jam
It ain't too much stuff
Jam
It ain't too much
It ain't too much for me to
Jam
It ain't
It ain't too much stuff
Jam
It ain't don't you
It ain't too much for me to

The world keeps changing rearranging minds and thoughts
Predictions fly of doom the baby boom has come of age we'll work it out
I told my brothers don't you ask me for no favors
I'm conditioned by the system don't ya talk to me or scream and shout
She prays to God to Buddha then she sings a talmud song
Confusions contradict the self do we know right from wrong
I just want you to recognize me in the temple
You can't hurt me I found peace within myself

Go with it go with it
Jam
It ain't
It ain't too much stuff
Jam
It ain't too much
It ain't too much for me to
Jam
It ain't
It ain't too much stuff
Jam
It ain't don't you
It ain't too much for me to
Jam
A-ha
It ain't too much stuff
Jam
It ain't too much
It ain't too much for me to
Jam
It ain't too
It ain't too much stuff
Jam
It ain't don't you
It ain't too much for me to
Haw

Jam jam here comes the man hot damn
The big boy stands movin' up a hand
Makin' funky tracks with my man Michael Jackson
Smooth criminal that the man is Mike so relaxed
Jingle mingle jingle in the jungle
Bum rushed the door three and four's in a bundle
