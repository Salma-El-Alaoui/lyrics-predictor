Destiny, destiny protect me from the world.
Destiny, hold my hand, protect me from the world.
Here we are with our running and confusion,
And I don't see no confusion anywhere.

And if the world does turn and if London burns,
I'll be standing on the beach with my guitar.
I want to be in a band when I get to heaven,
Anyone can play guitar and they won't be a nothing any more.

Grow my hair, grow my hair, I am Jim Morrison,
Grow my hair, I wanna be, wanna be, wanna be Jim Morrison.
Here we are with our running and confusion,
And I don't see no confusion anywhere.

And if the world does turn and if London burns,
I'll be standing on the beach with my guitar.
I want to be in a band when I get to heaven,
Anyone can play guitar and they won't be a nothing any more.
