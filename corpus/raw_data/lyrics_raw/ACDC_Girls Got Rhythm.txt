I've been around the world
I've seen a million girls
Ain't one of them got
What my lady she's got
She steals the spotlight
Knocks me off my feet
She's enough to start a landslide
Just a walkin down the street
Wearing dresses so tight
And looking dynamite
Enough to blow me out
No doubt about it can't live without it

(CHORUS)
The girl's got rhythm (girl's got rhythm)
The girl's got rhythm (girl's got rhythm)
She's got the backseat rhythm (backseat rhythm)
The girl's got rhythm

She's like a lethal brand
Too much for any man
She gives me first degree
She really satisfies me
Love me till I'm legless
Aching and sore
Enough to stop a freight train
Or start the Third World War
You know I'm losin sleep
I'm in too deep
Like a body needs blood
No doubt about it can't live without it

(CHORUS)

You know she moves like sin
And when she lets me in
It's like liquid love
No doubt about it can't live without it

The girl's got rhythm (girl's got rhythm)
The girl's got rhythm (girl's got rhythm)
She's got the backseat rhythm (backseat rhythm)
The girl's got rhythm (girl's got rhythm)
You know she really got the rhythm (girl's got rhythm)
She's got the backseat rhythm (backseat rhythm)
Rock n roll rhythm (rock n roll rhythm)
The girl's got rhythm
