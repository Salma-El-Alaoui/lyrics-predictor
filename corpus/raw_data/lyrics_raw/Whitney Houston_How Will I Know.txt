There's a boy I know
He's the one I dream of
Looks into my eyes
Takes me to the stars above
Oh I lose control
Can't seem to get enough
When I wake from dreaming
Tell me is it really love

How will I know
Girl trust your feelings
How will I know
How will I know
Love can be deceiving
How will I know

Chorus:
How will I know if he really loves me
I say a prayer with every heart beat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you what you know about these things
How will I know if he's thinking of me
I try to phone but I'm too shy - can't speak
Falling in love is so bitter sweet
This love is strong why do I feel weak

Oh, wake me, I'm shaking
Wish I had you near me now
Said there's no mistaking
What I feel is really love

How will I know
Girl trust your feelings
How will I know
How will I know
Love can be deceiving
How will I know

Chorus:
How will I know if he really loves me
I say a prayer with every heart beat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you what you know about these things
How will I know if he's thinking of me
I try to phone but I'm too shy - can't speak
Falling in love is so bitter sweet
This love is strong why do I feel weak

If he loves me, if he loves me not
He loves me, if he loves me not
He loves me, if he loves me not
Oh how will I know

Chorus:
How will I know if he really loves me
I say a prayer with every heart beat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you what you know about these things
How will I know if he's thinking of me
I try to phone but I'm too shy - can't speak
Falling in love is so bitter sweet
This love is strong why do I feel weak
