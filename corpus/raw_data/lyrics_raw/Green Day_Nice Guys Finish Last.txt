Nice guys finish last
You're running out of gas
Your sympathy will get you left behind
Sometimes you're at your best, when you feel the worst
Do you feel washed up, like piss going down the drain

Pressure cook and bake my brain and tell me I'm insane
I'm so fucking happy I could cry
Every joke can have it's truth and now the joke's on you
I never knew you were such a funny guy

Oh nice guys finish last, when you are the outcast
Don't pat yourself on the back, you might break your spine

Living on command
You're shaking lots of hands
Kissing up and bleeding all your trust, taking what you need
Bite the hand that feeds
You kill your memory and you' got no shame

Pressure cook and bake my brain and tell me I'm insane
I'm so fucking happy I could cry
Every joke can have it's truth and now the joke's on you
I never knew you were such a funny guy

Oh nice guys finish last, when you are the outcast
Don't pat yourself on the back, you might break your spine
Oh nice guys finish last, when you are the outcast
Don't pat yourself on the back, you might break your spine
Ooh!

Oh nice guys finish last, when you are the outcast
Don't pat yourself on the back, you might break your spine
Oh nice guys finish last, when you are the outcast
Don't pat yourself on the back, you might break your spine
