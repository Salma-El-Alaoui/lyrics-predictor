Ahhhhah Ahhhhah Ooohhh

Club Mix {x2}

How can I put this in a way so as not 2 offend or unnerve?
But there's a rumor goin' all around that U ain't been gettin'served
They say that U ain't "U know what" in, baby, who knows how long
It's hard 4 me 2 say what's right when all I wanna do is wrong

CHORUS:
Gett off – 23 positions in a one night stand
Gett off – I'll only call U after if U say I can
Gett off – Let a woman be a woman and a man be a man
Gett off – If U want 2, baby, here I am (Here I am)

I clocked the jizz from a friend of yours named Vanessa Bet (Bet)
She said U told her a fantasy that got her all wet (Wet)
Something about a little box with a mirror and a tongue inside(Yeah)
What she told me then got me so hot, I knew that we could slide(Ooh)

CHORUS

Gett off {repeat in BG}

1 2 3
Naw, little cutie, I ain't drinkin'
But scope this, I was just thinkin'
U + me, what a ride
If U was thinkin' the same, we could continue outside
Lay your pretty body against a parkin' meter
Strip your dress down like I was strippin' a Peter Paul's AlmondJoy
Lemme show U, baby, I'm a talented boy

Everybody grab a body
Pump it like U want somebody
Gett off

So here we, so here we…
So here we are, here we are in my paisley crib
What cha want 2 eat? (Ribs!)
Naw toy, I don't serve ribs
U better be happy that dress is still on
I heard the rip when U sat down
Honey, them hips is gone
But that's alright, I clock 'em that way
Remind me of somethin' James used 2 say
"I like 'em fat, I like 'em proud
U got 2 have a mother 4 me"
Now move your big ass 'round this way
So I can work on that zipper, baby
2night U're a star and I'm the Big Dipper
Na, na, na, na {x2}

(Kick it)
