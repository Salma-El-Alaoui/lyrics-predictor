Heard it first from Reagan youth,
Dead Kennedys and D.I. too.
Wanna burn the effigie,
From DRI to MDC.

But I miss the days of Reagan punk.
We all shared the same enemy,
From CFA to Shattered Faith.

Guess what nostalgia sucks,
But I miss songs about Reagan sucks.
We all shared the same memory,
From DRI to MDC.
