Shut my eyes
Feel the colour of you
So get to this elation
So high so fast

Shut my eyes
Feel the colour of you
Succumb to this illusion
So strong so deep

Cos everyday is all there is
In my some kind of bliss
Cos everyday is all there is
In my some kind of bliss

Study my reflection
and let the colours fall
Slip into stillness
And be above it all

Good to be here
Time to be alone
I've found a space where I belong
Not succumb to fear

Cos everyday is all there is
In my some kind of bliss
Cos everyday is all there is
In my some kind of bliss
