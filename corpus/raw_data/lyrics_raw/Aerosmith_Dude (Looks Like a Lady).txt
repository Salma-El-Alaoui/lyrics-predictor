Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady

Cruised into a bar on the shore
Her picture graced the grime on the door
She a long lost love at first bite
Baby maybe you're wrong, but you know it's alright
That's right

Backstage we're having the time
Of our lives until somebody say
Forgive me if I seem out of line
Then she whipped out her gun and tried to blow me away

Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady

So never judge a book by its cover
Or who you're gonna love by your lover
Love put me wise to her love in disguise
She had the body of a Venus, Lord imagine my surprise

Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady

(Baby let me follow you down) Let me take a peek dear
(Baby let me follow you down) Do me, do me, do me all night
(Baby let me follow you down) Turn the other cheek dear
(Baby let me follow you down) Do me, do me, do me, do me

Ooh what a funky lady
She like it, like it, like it, like that
Ooh he was a lady

Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady

Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady

Dude, dude, dude, dude looks like a lady
Dude, dude, dude, dude looks like a lady
Dude, dude, dude, dude looks like a lady
Dude, dude, dude, dude looks like a lady
