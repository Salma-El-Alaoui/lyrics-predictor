Why can't you see
That I'm still mad about you
Even though I've found out about you
I'll always stay forever true

And in my heart
I will forgive you
I've got so much love to give you

CHORUS:
It's never too late
We've still got time
It's never too late
You can still be mine
It's never too late
To change your mind

Why can't you try
And be a man about it
And if you stop and think about it
You just can't keep walking out on me
And even if it takes forever
Your love's better late than never

CHORUS:

It's never too late
It's never too late
It's never too late
To change your mind

Though I try
I can never put you from my mind
You just creep right back inside
And there's no place I can hide

And in my heart
I will forgive you
I've got so much love to give you

CHORUS:
repeat & fade
