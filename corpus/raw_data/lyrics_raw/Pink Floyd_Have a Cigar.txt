Come in here, dear boy, have a cigar,
you're gonna go far,
you're gonna fly high,
you're never gonna die,
you're gonna make it if you try,
they're gonna love you.
I've always had a deep respect and I mean that most sincere;
the band is just fantastic, that is really what I think,
oh, by the way, which one's Pink?

And did we tell you the name of the game, boy?
We call it "Riding The Gravy Train".

We're just knocked out.
We heard about the sell out.
You're gonna get an album out,
you owe it to the people.
We're so happy we can hardly count.
Everybody else is just green,
have you seen the chart?
It's a hell of a start,
it could be made into a monster,
if we all pull together as a team.

And did we tell you the name of the game, boy?
We call it "Riding The Gravy Train".
