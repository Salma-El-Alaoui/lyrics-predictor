I was just walking that day aimlessly
You picked the perfect day to bump into me (perfect day)
Probably should have watched the stars in the sky the night before
But for some reason
We still met at your store
You baby
And your eyes have a story
That they wish to tell
And I have my whole life and I listen well
Hey
Look I'll be your confidante
Tell me anything
But please start it off with how you tuck your wings

There's nothing else that I have seen
There's no getting around it or in between
You're out of this world
Except you're not green (look)
You don't know what you mean to me
To me

All my friends meet you and say you're the one
(You're the one you're the one)
And all my meaningless friendships should be done
I should just leave them alone
Baby hey hey
You had a friend but he did you wrong
But I'm a God sent sign that reads
Please move on with me

You taught me to use my heart and forget my eyes
(Use my heart forget my eyes)
And that's the way to his kingdom to eternal life
Since you're an angel baby your job's never done
Too bad the world won't see you when they dial 911
(Thats why)

There's nothing else that I have seen
There's no getting around it or in between
You're out of this world
Except you're not green (look)
You dont know what you mean to me
To me

There's nothing else that I have seen
There's no getting around it or in between
You're out of this world
Except you're not green (look)
You dont know what you mean to me
To me

There's nothing else in this world
Like you
Yeah
So why is it so complicated
What are you afraid of

I've been asking everybody what they think
But I dont know why because they don't know you
I'm even askin other guys what would they say
I don't know why cos they don't know what I do
Girls say an ultimatums the thing
But you'd probably take that and just run
Now I gotta decide if I'ma help raise your mind
Seems like the ultimatums on me, thats no fun

I was just walking that day aimlessly
Da da da dum
Da da da dum
Da da da dum
Dum dum dum....
