Red over white
It's one last fatal scene
Brought on by someone unseen
Moving on their own
Bring on the night
And bring us all to our knees
All are gone and none agreed
One who acts alone

Nobody wins
Nobody hears us fall
Nobody wins
When it's done
Conspiracy of one

Bring on the night
And bring us all to our knees
All are gone and none agreed
One who acts alone

Red over white
It's one last fatal scene
Brought on by someone unseen
Moving on their own

(2x)
Nobody wins
Nobody hears us fall
Nobody wins
When it's done
Conspiracy of one

(guitar interlube)

(2x)
Nobody wins
Nobody hears us fall
Nobody wins
When it's done
Conspiracy of one
