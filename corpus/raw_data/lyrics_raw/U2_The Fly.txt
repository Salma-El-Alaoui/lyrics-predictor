It's no secret that the stars are falling from the sky
It's no secret that our world is in darkness tonight
They say the sun is sometimes
Eclipsed by a moon
You know I don't see you
When she walks in the room

It's no secret that a friend is someone who lets you help
It's no secret that a liar won't believe anyone else
They say a secret is something
You tell one other person
So I'm telling you
Child

That, love, we shine like a burning star
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
We're falling from the sky tonight
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
A man will beg
A man will crawl
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
On the sheer face of love
Like a fly from a wall
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
It's no secret at all

No secret that a conscience can sometimes be a pest
No secret ambition bites the nails of success
Every artist is a cannibal
Every poet is a thief
All kill their inspiration
And sing about their grief
Oh love

Love, we shine like a burning star
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love

We're falling from the sky tonight
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
A man will beg
A man will crawl
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
On the sheer face of love
Like a fly from a wall
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
It's no secret at all

Love, we shine like a burning star
Weâ€™re falling from the sky tonight
A man will beg
A man will crawl
On the sheer face of love
Like a fly from a wall
It's no secret at all

It's no secret that the stars are falling from the sky
The universe exploded 'cause of one man's lie
Check, I gotta go
Yeah, I'm running outta change
There's a lot of things
If I could, I'd rearrange
