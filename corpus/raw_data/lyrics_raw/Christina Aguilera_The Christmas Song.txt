Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks all dressed up like eskimos
Everybody knows that turkey and some mistletoe
Will help to make the season bright
And tiny tots with their eyes all a glow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas,

Merry Christmas
to you
