I can't get you off my mind
No matter what I do
I'm wishing you were here, with me
It makes no difference
I only think of you
And I living out my fantasy

Midnight, I run to you
Being such a love sick fool
It might be pouring rain
Still the same, nothings changed
All and all I feel no shame
I'm just your fool insane
(I'm just your fool)

Chorus:
I keep thinking about you baby
So tell me what you're gonna do
I thinking about you
All I wanna do is

Like a river of wine, intoxicate my mind
I'm thinking about you
That's what I wanna do
Pick me up, let's go down
I'm thinking about it too
I'm thinking about you
Ya got me thinking about you
I'm thinking about it too

Make believing is a game
That's not for me to play
Don't you need me just like I need you
Just like I need you
There's no reason
Just my heart that makes me feel this way
And I hope you feel the same way too

Midnight, I run to you
Being such a love sick fool
It might be pouring rain
Still the same, nothings changed
All and all I feel no shame
I'm just your fool insane
(I'm just your fool)

Chorus:
I keep thinking about you baby
So tell me what you're gonna do
I keep thinking about you
All I wanna do is

Like a river of wine, intoxicate my mind
I'm thinking about you
That's what I wanna do
Pick me up, let's go down
I'm thinking about it too (yea, yea. yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yeah)
I'm thinking about you
Got me thinking about you
I'm thinking about it too

It might be pouring in the rain
But like a fool insane
I run I run I run I run to you
I'm just a lovesick fool
I've got this thing for you
I'm just a I'm just a love sick fool

I'm just a fool oh

I keep thinking about you baby
So tell me what you're gonna do
Got me thinking about you
All I wanna do is

Like a river of wine, intoxicate my mind
I'm thinking about you
That's what I wanna do
Pick me up, let's go down
I'm thinking about it too (yea, yea. yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yeah)
I'm thinking about you
Got me thinking about you
I'm thinking about it too

Like a river of wine, intoxicate my mind

Pick me up, let's go down
I'm thinking about it too (yea, yea. yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yeah)
I'm thinking about you
Got me thinking about you
I'm thinking about it too
