Gettin' ready to rock, gettin' ready to roll
Gonna turn up the heat, gonna fire up the coal
I gotta that motor turnin'
I gotta keep that engine clean
I gotta keep those tyres burnin'
I've got the best you've ever seen

Cos I'm a heatseeker, chargin' up the sky
Heatseeker, and I, don't need no life preserver
Don't need no one to hose me down
To hose me down

Getting ready to break, get ready to go
Get your shoes off an' shake, get your head down and blow
Ya gotta keep that woman firin'
You gotta keep that circuit clean
You gotta make her sound the siren
You gotta hear that lady scream

Cos I'm a heatseeker, burnin' up the town
Heatseeker, I don't, I don't need no life preserver
Don't need no one to hose me down
To hose me down, here it comes

Heatseeker
Wanna see you get up, see the whites of your eyes
I'm a heatseeker
I'm gonna measure you, gonna try you for size
I'm a heatseeker

Ya gotta keep that motor turnin'
Ya gotta keep that engine clean
Ya gotta keep those tyres burnin'
I got the best you've ever seen
I'm a heatseeker
I don't need no life preserver
Don't need no one to hose me down

I'm a heatseeker, I'm a heatseeker, heatseeker

Out on the street feel the heat
