It is so easy to see
Dysfunction between you and me
We must free up these tired souls
Before the sadness kills us both

I’ve tried and tried
To let you know
I love you
But I'm letting go
It may not last
But I don't know
I just don't know

If you don't know
Then you can't care
Say you’ll show up
But you're not there
But I'm waiting
And you want to
Still afraid that I will desert you

Everyday
With every worthless word
We get more far away
The distance between us
Makes it so hard to stay
But nothing lasts forever
But be honest babe
It hurts but it may be the only way

A bed that's warm with memories
Can heal us temporarily
But misbehaving only makes
The ditch between us so damn deep

Built a wall around my heart
Never let it fall apart
But strangely I wish secretly
It would fall down while I'm asleep

If you don't know
Then you can't care
Say you’ll show up
But you're not there
But I'm waiting
And you want to
Still afraid that I will desert you, babe

Everyday
With every worthless word
We get more far away
The distance between us
Makes it so hard to stay
But nothing lasts forever
But be honest babe
It hurts but it may be the only way

Though we have not hit the ground
Doesn't mean we're not still falling
Oh, I want so bad to pick you up
But you're still too
Reluctant to accept my help
What a shame
I hope you find somewhere to place the blame
But until then the fact remains

Everyday
With every worthless word
We get more far away
The distance between us
Makes it so hard to stay
But nothing lasts forever
But be honest babe
It hurts but it may be the only way

Everyday
With every worthless word
We get more far away
The distance between us
Makes it so hard to stay
But nothing lasts forever
But be honest babe
It hurts but it may be the only way
