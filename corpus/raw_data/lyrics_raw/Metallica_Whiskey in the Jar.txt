As I was goin' over the Cork and Kerry mountains
I saw Captain Farrell, and his money he was countin'
I first produced my pistol and then produced my rapier
I said, "Stand and deliver," oh, "or the Devil, he may take ya"

I took all of his money and it was a pretty penny
I took all of his money and I brought it home to Molly
She swore that she'd love me, no, never would she leave me
But the Devil take that woman, for you know she tricked me easy

Mush-a-ring dum a do dum a da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o

Being drunk and weary, I went to Molly's chamber
Takin' my Molly with me, but I never knew the danger
For about six, maybe seven, yeah, in walked Captain Farrell
I jumped up, fired my pistols and I shot him with both barrels

Mush-a-ring dum a do dum a da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o

Yeah, whiskey, oh
Yeah
oh-ho, yeah, oh

Now some men like the fishin' and some man like the foulin'
And some men like ta hear, ta hear cannon ball roarin'
Me I like sleepin', 'specially in my Molly's chamber
But here I am in prison, here I am with a ball and chain, yeah

Mush-a-ring dum a do dum a da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o

Whiskey in the jar-o

Mush-a-ring dum a doo dum a da (x4)
