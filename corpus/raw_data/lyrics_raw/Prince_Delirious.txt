I get delirious, whenever you're near
Lose all self control baby, just can't steer
Wheels get locked in place
Stupid look on my face
Comes to makin a pass pretty mamma
I just cant win a race
Cuz I get delirious

Delirious(x3)

I get delirious, when you hold my hand
My body gets so weak I can hardly stand
My temperature's running hot
Baby you got to stop
Cuz if you don't I'm gonna explode
And girl I got a lot
I get delirious

Delirious(x3)

I get delirious, whenever you're near
Girl you gotta take control cause I just cant steer
You're just too much too take
I can't stop I ain't got no breaks
Girl you gotta take me for a little ride
Up and down in and out and around your lake
I'm delirious

Delirious(ad lib until end)
