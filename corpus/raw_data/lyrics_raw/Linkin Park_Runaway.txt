Graffiti decorations under a sky of dust
A constant wave of tension on top of broken trust
The lessons that you taught me, I learned were never true
Now I find myself in question, they point the finger at me again
Guilty by association, you point the finger at me again

I want to run away, never say good bye
I want to know the truth instead of wondering why
I want to know the answers, no more lies
I want to shut the door and open up my mind

Paper bags and angry voices under a sky of dust
Another wave of tension has more than filled me up
All my talk of taking action these words were never true
Now I find myself in question, they point the finger at me again
Guilty by association, you point the finger at me again

I want to run away, never say good bye
I want to know the truth instead of wondering why
I want to know the answers, no more lies
I want to shut the door and open up my mind

I'm going to run away and never say good bye
Going to run away, going to run away
Going to run away, going to run away
I'm going to run away and never wonder why
Going to run away, going to run away
Going to run away, going to run away
I'm going to run away and open up my mind
Going to run away, going to run away, mind
Going to run away, going to run away, mind
Going to run away, going to run away, mind
Going to run away, going to run away

I want to run away, never say good bye
I want to know the truth instead of wondering why
I want to know the answers, no more lies
I want to shut the door and open up my mind

I want to run away and open up my mind
I want to run away and open up my mind
I want to run away and open up my mind
I want to run away and open up my mind
