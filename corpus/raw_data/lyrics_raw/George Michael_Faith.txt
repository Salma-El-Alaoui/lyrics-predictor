Well, I guess it would be nice
If I could touch your body
I know not everybody
Has got a body like you.

Oh, but I gotta think twice
Before I give my heart away
And I know all the games you play
Because I play them, too.

Oh, but I need some time off from that emotion,
Time to pick my heart up off the floor.
And when that love comes down without devotion,
Well, it takes a strong man baby, but I'm
Showing you the door,

Cause I gotta have Faith
I gotta have... Faith
Because I've gotta have Faith, Faith, Faith
I gotta have Faith, Faith, Faith.

Baby, I know you're asking me to stay
Saying please, please, please don't go away
You say I'm giving you the blues.

Maybe you mean every word you say
Can't help but think of yesterday
And another who tied me down to loverboy rules

Before this river becomes an ocean
Before you throw my heart back on the floor
Oh baby, I reconsider my foolish notion
Well, I need someone to hold me,
But I'll wait for something more.

Cause I gotta have Faith...
(*Repeat Chorus*)

Before this river
Becomes an ocean
Before you throw my heart back on the floor
(I've just got to have faith)
I've reconsidered my foolish notion

Yeah, I need someone to hold me,
But I'll wait for something more....

(*Pause*)

Cause I gotta have Faith
(*Final chorus*)
