reeko, try to understand, it really is that bad
it won't just go away, the party's over
it's past two o'clock, so it's about time we
stopped, 'cause I
see the keg has been sucked dry
the cisco was emptied into the aquarium
where the fish all seem to play the ex lax lines
the dog bowl
the toilet's overflowed, we're had our fun so
now there's nothing left to damage
we got no place left to go
mr. President please understand, it really is that bad
it won't just go away, it's just beginning
the ballots have been cast, we make like seaward rats
leave this sinking ship, leave and not look back
the things we never tried to disallow
have come back to haunt us now
with apple pie and Chevrolet
we've come to see the end, we all made this bed
now we got nowhere to lay,
dies and gentlemen
try to understand
