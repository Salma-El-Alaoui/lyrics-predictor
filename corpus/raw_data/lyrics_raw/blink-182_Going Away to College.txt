Please take me by the hand
It's so cold out tonight, I'll
Put blankets on the bed
I won't turn out the light, just
Don't forget to
Think about me, and I
Won't forget you
&amp;quot;I'll write you once a week,&amp;quot; she said

Why does it feel the same
To fall in love or break it off?
And if young love is just a game, then
I must have missed the kick-off
Don't depend on me to
Ever follow through on
Anything but
I'd go through Hell for you and

I haven't been this scared
In a long time
And I'm so unprepared
So here's your valentine
Bouquet of clumsy words
A simple melody
This world's an ugly place
But you're so beautiful to me

I'll think about the times
She kissed me after class and
She put up with my friends
I acted like an ass, I
Ditched my lecture
To watch the girls play soccer
Is my picture
Still hanging in her locker?

I haven't been this scared
In a long time
And I'm so unprepared
So here's your valentine
Bouquet of clumsy words
A simple melody
This world's an ugly place
But you're so beautiful...

I haven't been this scared
In a long time
And I'm so unprepared
So here's your valentine
Bouquet of clumsy words
A simple melody
This world's an ugly place
But you're so beautiful...
