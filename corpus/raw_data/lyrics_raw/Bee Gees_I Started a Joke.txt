I started a joke,
Which started the whole world crying,
But I didn't see
That the joke was on me,
Oh no.

I started to cry,
Which started the whole world laughing,
Oh, if I'd only seen
That the joke was on me.

I looked at the skies,
Running my hands over my eyes,
And I fell out of bed,
Hurting my head from things that I'd said.

'Till I finally died,
Which started the whole world living,
Oh, if I'd only seen
That the joke was on me.

That the joke was one me (x3)
