It was an April morning when they told us we should go.
As I turned to you, you smiled at me; how could we say no?
Whoa, the fun to have! To live the dreams we always had.
Whoa, the songs to sing! When we at last return again.

Sending off a glancing kiss to those who claim they know
Below the streets that steam and hiss, the devil's in his home.
Whoa, to sail away! Sandy lands and other days.
Whoa, to touch the dream! That hides inside and is never seen, yeah.

Into the sun of south and north at last the birds have flown.
The shackles of commitment fell in pieces on the ground.
Whoa, to ride the wind! To tread the air above the din.
Whoa, to laugh aloud! Dancing high above the crowd.

Seek the man whose pointing hand the giant step unfolds.
With guidance from the curving path that churns up into stone!
If one bell should ring, celebration for a king.
So fast the heart should beat, as proud the head with heavy feet, yeah.

[Solo]

Days went by when you and I made an eternal summer's glow
As far away and distant, our mutual time to grow.
Whoa, the sweet refrain! It soothes the soul and calms the pain.
Oh, Albion remains! Sleeping now to rise again.

Wandering the wanderings. What place to rest the search?
Where the mighty arms of Atlas hold the heavens from the earth!
Where the mighty arms of Atlas hold the heavens from the earth!
From the earth!

I know the way, know the way, know the way, know the way.
I know the way, know the way, know the way, know the way.

Where the mighty arms of Atlas hold the heavens from the earth!
