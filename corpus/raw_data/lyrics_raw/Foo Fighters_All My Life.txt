All my life I've been searching for somethin'
Somethin' never comes, never leads to nothin'
Nothin' satisfies, but I'm getting close
Closer to the prize at the end of the rope

All night long I dream of the day,
When it comes around, and it's taken away
Leaves me with the feelin' that I feel the most
I feel it come to life when I see your ghost

Come down don't you resist
You have such a delicate wrist
And if I give it a twist
Something to hold when I lose my grip
Will I find something in that
So give me just what I need
Another reason to bleed
One by one hidden up my sleeve, one by one hidden up my sleeve

Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it but I hate that taste
Weight keeping me down

Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it but I hate that taste
Weight keeping me down

Will I find the believer?
Another one who believes
Another one to deceive
Over and over down on my knees

If I get any closer
And if you open up wide
And if you let me inside
On and on I got nothing to hide, on and on I got nothing to hide

Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it but I hate that taste
Weight keeping me down

Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it but I hate that taste
Weight keeping me down

All my life I've been searching for somethin'
Somethin' never comes, never leads to nothin'
Nothin' satisfies, but I'm getting close
Closer to the prize at the end of the rope
All night long I dream of the day
When it comes around and it's taken away
Leaves me with the feelin' that I feel the most
Feel it come to life when I see your ghost

And I'm done, done onto the next one
Done, done and I'm onto the next one
Done, done and I'm onto the next one
Done, done and I'm onto the next one
Done, done and I'm onto the next one
Done, done and I'm onto the next one
Done, done and I'm onto the next one
Done, I'm done and I'm onto the next

Done, done onto the next one!
Done, I'm done and I'm on to the next one!
Done, done onto the next one!
Done, I'm done and I'm on to the next one!

Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it but I hate that taste
Weight keeping me down

Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it but I hate that taste
Weight keeping me down

Done, done onto the next one!
Done, I'm done and I'm on to the next one!
