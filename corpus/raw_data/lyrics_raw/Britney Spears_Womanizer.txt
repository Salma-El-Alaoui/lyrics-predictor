Superstar 
Where you from, how's it going? 
I know you 
Gotta clue, what youre doing? 
You can play brand new to all the other chicks out here 
But I know what you are, what you are, baby 

Look at you 
Gettin' more than just re-up 
Baby, you 
Got all the puppets with their strings up 
Fakin' like a good one, but I call 'em like I see 'em 
I know what you are, what you are, baby

Daddy-O 
You got the swagger of champion 
Too bad for you 
Just can't find the right companion 
I guess when you have one too many, makes it hard 
It could be easy 
Who you are, that's who you are, baby 

Lollipop 
Must mistake me you're a sucker 
To think that I 
Would be a victim not another 
Say it, play it how you wanna 
But no way I'm ever gonna fall for you, never you, baby
