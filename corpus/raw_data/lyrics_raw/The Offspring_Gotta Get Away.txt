I'm gettin' edgy
All the time
There's someone around me
Just a step behind
It's kinda scary
The shape I'm in
The walls are shakin'
And they're closing in
Too fast or
A bit too slow
I'm paranoid of people
And it's starting to show
There's one guy that
I can't shake
Over my shoulder
Is a big mistake

Sitting on the bed
Or lying wide awake
There's demons in my head
And it's more than I can take
I think I'm on a roll
But I think it's kinda weak
Sayin' all I know is
I gotta get away from me

I tell you something
Just ain't right
My head is on loose
But my shoes are tight
Avoiding friends 'cause
They all bug
Life is like a riddle
And I'm really stumped
If you reason
Don't you know
Your own preoccupation
Is where you'll go
I think I'm bein' followed
I look around
It's only my shadow
Creepin' on the ground

Sitting on the bed
Or lying wide awake
There's demons in my head
And it's more than I can take
I think I'm on a roll
But I think it's kinda weak
Sayin' all I know is
I gotta get away from me
Gotta get away from me
Gotta get away from me

Whoa-oah-oah, whoa-oah-oah
Whoa-oah-oah, whoa-oah-oah

Sitting on the bed
Or lying wide awake
There's demons in my head
And it's more than I can take
I think I'm on a roll
But I think it's kinda weak
Sayin' all I know is
I gotta get away from me
Gotta get away from me
Gotta get away from me
Gotta get away from me
