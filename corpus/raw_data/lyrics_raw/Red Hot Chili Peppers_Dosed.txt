I got dosed by you (and)
Closer than most to you (and)
What am I sposed' to do
Take it away I never had it anyway
Take it away and everything will be okay

In you a star is born (and)
You cut a perfect form (and)
Someone forever warm
Lay on Lay on Lay on Lay on
Lay on Lay on Lay on Lay on

Way up on the mountain where she died
All I ever wanted was your life
Deep inside the canyon I can't hide
All I ever wanted was your life

Show love with no remorse (and)
Climb onto your sea horse (and)
This ride is right on course
This is the way I wanted it to be with you
This is the way I knew that it would be with you
Lay on Lay on Lay on Lay on
Lay on Lay on Lay on Lay on

Way up on the mountain where she died
All I ever wanted was your life
Deep inside the canyon I can't hide
All I ever wanted was your life

I got dosed by you (and)
Closer than most to you (and)
What am I sposed' to do
Take it away I never had it anyway
Take it away and everything will be ok

Way up on the mountain where she died
All I ever wanted was your life
Deep inside the canyon I can't hide
All I ever wanted was your life
