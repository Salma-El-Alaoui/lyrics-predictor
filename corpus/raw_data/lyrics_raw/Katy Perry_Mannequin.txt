How do I get closer to you
When you keep it all on mute
How do I know the right way to love you
Usually the queen at figuring out
Breaking down the man is no workout
But I have no clue how to get through to you

I wanna hit you just to see if you cry
I keep knocking on wood hoping there's a real boy inside

'Cause you're not a man you're just a mannequin
I wish you could feel that my love is real
But you're not a man

I wish I could just turn you on
Put a battery in and make you talk
Even pull a string for you to say anything
But with you there is no guarantee only expired warranty
A bunch of broken parts but I can't seem to find your heart

I'm such a fool I'm such a fool I'm such a fool
This one's outta my hands
I can't put you back together again

'Cause you're not a man you're just a mannequin
I wish you could feel that my love is real but you're not a man
You're just a, a toy could you ever be a real, real boy
And understand but you're not a man

If the past is the problem our future could solve them baby
I could bring you to life if you let me inside baby
It'll hurt but in the end you'll be a man

You're not a man you're just a mannequin
I wish you could feel that my love is real a toy
Could you ever be a real, real boy
And understand but you're not a man

You're not a man you're just a mannequin
I wish you could feel that my love is real but you're not a man
