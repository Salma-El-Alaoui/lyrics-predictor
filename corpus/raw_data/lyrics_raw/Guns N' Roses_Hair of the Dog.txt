"Give me a little bit volume on this."

You're a heart-breakin' soul shaker,
Well, I've been told about you
I've seen y'on the midnight show girl,
A-what they've been sayin' must be true

Red hot mama,
There'll be trouble,
I say time's gonna pay your dues

Now you're messin' with a son of a bitch
Now you're messin' with a son of a bitch
Now you're messin' with a son of a bitch
Now you're messin' with a son of a bitch

Talkin' jive and poison ivy
You ain't gonna cling to me
Man take a bold thinker
I ain't so blind I can't see

Red hot mama
There'll be trouble
Time's gonna pay your dues.

Now you're messin' with a son of a bitch
Now you're messin' with a son of a bitch
Now you're messin' with a son of a bitch
Now you're messin' with a son of a bitch
