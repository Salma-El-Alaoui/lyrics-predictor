- Chorus -
Outrageous (when I move my body)
Outrageous (when I'm at a party)
Outrageous (in my sexy jeans)
Outrageous (when I'm on the scene)
Outrageous (my sex drive)
Outrageous (my shopping spree)
Outrageous (we're on a world tour)
Outrageous (that's B-girl)

Outrageous
Sexy as I wanna be
Got these fellas chasin me
It's about time I hit the street
All my girls still feeling me

And B girl ain't lost the beat
Jumped over drama and I landed on my feet
Gotta keep going, no stopping me
And if you don't like it then
La la la la la la la

Media over here
Coming through like a world premiere
Trenchcoat and my underwear
Let's go with this freak show

It's ...

-Chorus-

I'm about to bring the heat
Locking down the industry
Aren't I super glamorous
Red carpets and cameras
Take trips around the globe
Tint's on my Jeeps so nobody knows
So hot that you're coming out your clothes
Now I'm about to give you
La la la la la la la

Media over here
Coming through like a world premiere
Trenchcoat and my underwear
Let's go with this freak show

It's ...

- Chorus-

I just wanna be happy
In a place where love is free
Can you take me there?
Somebody, ooh
And when you mention my name
Make sure you know the truth, yeah
Until I vow to keep it forever
