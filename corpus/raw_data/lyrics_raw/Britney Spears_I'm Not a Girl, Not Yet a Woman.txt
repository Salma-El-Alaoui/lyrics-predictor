I used to think
I had the answers to everything
But now I know
That life doesn't always go my way, yeah

Feels like I'm caught in the middle
That's when I realize

I'm not a girl, not yet a woman
All I need is time
A moment that is mine
While I'm in between
I'm not a girl

There is no need to protect me
It's time that I
Learn to face up to this on my own, oh

I've seen so much more than you know now
So don't tell me to shut my eyes

I'm not a girl, not yet a woman
All I need is time
A moment that is mine
While I'm in between
I'm not a girl

But if you look at me closely
You will see it in my eyes
This girl will always find her way

(I'm not a girl) I'm not a girl, don't tell me what to believe
(Not yet a woman) I'm just trying to find the woman in me, yeah
(All I need is time) Oh, all I need is time
That's mine, while I'm in between

I'm not a girl, not yet a woman
All I need is time
A moment that is mine
While I'm in between

I'm not a girl, ooh
Not yet a woman
