Into the Abyss I'll fall-the eye of Horus
Into the eyes of the night-watching me go
Green is the cat's eye that glows-
in this Temple
Enter the risen Osiris-risen again.

Tell me why I had to be a Powerslave
I don't wanna die, I'm a God,
why can't I live on?
When the Life Giver dies,
all around is laid waste.
And in my last hour,
I'm a slave to the Power of Death.

When I was living this lie-Fear was my game
People would worship and fall-
drop to their knees.
So bring me the blood and red wine
for the one to succeed me,
for he is a man and a God-
and He will die too.

Tell me why I had to be a Powerslave
I don't wanna die, I'm a God,
why can't I live on?
When the Life Giver dies,
all around is laid to waste.
And in my last hour,
I'm a slave to the Power of Death.

Now I am cold but a ghost lives in my veins,
Silent the terror that reigned-
marbled in stone.
A shell of a man God preserved-
a thousand ages,
But open the gates of my Hell-
I will strike from my grave.

Tell me why I had to be a Powerslave
I don't wanna die, I'm a God,
why can't I live on?
When the Life Giver dies,
all around is laid waste.
And in my last hour,
I'm a slave to the Power of Death,
Slave to the Power of Death...
Slave to the Power of Death...
