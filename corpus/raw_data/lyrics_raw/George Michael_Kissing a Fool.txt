You are far, when I could have been your star
You listened to people
Who scared you to death, and from my heart
Strange that you were strong enough
To even make a start
But you'll never find peace of mind
Till you listen to your heart

People, you can never change the way they feel
Better let them do just what they will
For they will, If you let them
Steal your heart from you
People,Will always make a lover feel a fool
But you knew I loved you
We could have shown them all
We should have seen love through

Fooled me with the tears in your eyes
Covered me with kisses and lies
So good-bye, but please don't take my heart

You are far, I'm never gonna be your star
I'll pick up the pieces and mend my heart
Maybe I'll be strong enough, I don't know where to start
But I'll never find peace of mind, while I listen to my heart
People, you can never change the way they feel
Better let them do just what they will
For they will, If you let them, steal your heart

And people, will always make a lover feel a fool
But you knew I loved you,
We could have shown them all
We should have seen love through

But remember this, every other kiss,
That you ever give, long as we both live
When you need the hand of another man
One you really can surrender with
I will wait for you, like I always do
There's something there, that can't compare
With any other

You are far
When I could have been your star
You listened to people
Who scared you to death, and from my heart
Strange that I was wrong enough
To think you'd love me too.
I guess you were kissing a fool

You must have been kissing a fool
