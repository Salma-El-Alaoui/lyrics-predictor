Well there's a backseat lover who's always undercover
and I talked to my Dad he say
He said "You ain't seen nothin' till you're down on a muffin
Then you're sure to be a changin' your ways"
I met a cheerleader
Was a real young bleeder
All the times I could reminisce
'Cause the best things in lovin' with her sister and her cousin
Only started with a little kiss like this!

Seesaw swingin' with the boys in the school
And your feet flyin' up in the air
I sing "Hey diddle diddle"
Put your kitty in the middle of the swing
Like you didn't care
So I took a big chance at the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Wasn't me she was foolin'
'Cause she knew what she was doin'
And I knowed love was here to stay
When she told me to...

CHORUS
walk this way, talk this way, walk this way
talk this way,
Uh, just gimme a kiss!
Like this.

School girl sweetie with a classy kinda sassy
Little skirt's climbin' way up her knee,
There was three young ladies in the school gym locker
When I noticed they was lookin' at me.
I was a high school loser, never made it with the ladies
Till the boys told me somethin' I missed,
Then my next door neighbor with a daughter had a favor
So I gave her just a little kiss a like this

Seesaw swingin' with the boys in the school
And your feet flyin' up in the air,
I sing "Hey diddle diddle"
Put your kitty in the middle of the swing
Like you didn't care.
So I took a big chance at the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play,
Wasn't me she was foolin'
'Cause she knew what she was doin'
When she told me how to walk this way.
She told me to

CHORUS
