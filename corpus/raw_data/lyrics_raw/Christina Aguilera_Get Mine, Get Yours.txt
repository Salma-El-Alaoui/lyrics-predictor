Baby you pretend that things
Ain't what they seem
All this tension of titling
Just exactly what we should be
Now I don't mind us being
Some kind of casual thing
Listen, all I wanna do for now
Is have you come and take all of me

Can you
Put your hands on my waistline
Want your skin up against mine
Move my hips to the baseline
Let me get mine, you get yours
Hang a please don't disturb sign
Put my back into a slow grind
Sending chills up and down my spine
Let me get mine, you get yours

If you see me with a man
Understand that you can't question me
The feelings that you caught
Ain't my fault, can't help your jealousy
If you can handle the fact that
What we have has got to be commitment free
Then we can keep this undercover lovin', cummin'
Hidden underneath the sheets

Can you
Put your hands on my waistline
Want your skin up against mine
Move my hips to the baseline
Let me get mine, you get yours (but don't fall in love)
Hang a please don't disturb sign
Put my back into a slow grind
Sending chills up and down my spine
Let me get mine, you get yours

So, come on and freak my body
We can get nasty, naughty
All night a private party
Gotta hit that spot just right
Work me like a 9 to 5
It ain't about the kissin' and huggin'
Cause this is a physical lovin'
Straight sweatin', our bodies are rubbin'
Gotta hit that spot just right
Work me like a 9 to 5

We have a physical thing
We'll make love, but don't fall in love (Let me get mine, you get yours, oh ooooooooh)
We spend time
Just enough so you get yours, and I get mine
No strings attached (Let me get mine, you get yours)
I want your body, not your heart

Can you
Put your hands on my waistline (put your hands on my waistline)
Want your skin up against mine
Move my hips to the baseline
Let me get mine, you get yours (but don't fall in love)
Hang a please don't disturb sign
Put my back into a slow grind
Sending chills up and down my spine
Let me get mine, you get yours

Put your hands on my waistline
Want your skin up against mine
Move my hips to the baseline
Let me get mine, you get yours (but don't fall in love)
Hang a please don't disturb sign
Put my back into a slow grind
Sending chills up and down my spine
Let me get mine, you get yours

Come here
Don't be shy
I won't bite (Let me get mine, you get yours)
