Verse 1:
In the event of something happening to me
There is something I would like you all to see
It's just a photograph of someone that I knew

Chorus:
Have you seen my wife, Mr. Jones?
Do you know what it's like on the outside?
Don't go talking too loud, you'll cause a landslide,
Mr. Jones.

Verse 2:
I keep straining my ears to hear a sound
Maybe someone is digging underground
Or have they given up and all gone home to bed?
Thinking those who once existed must be dead?

Chorus:
Have you seen my wife, Mr. Jones?
Do you know what it's like on the outside?
Don't go talking too loud, you'll cause a landslide,
Mr. Jones

Verse 3 (repeat of verse 1):
In the event of something happening to me
There is something I would like you all to see
It's just a photograph of someone that I knew

Chorus:
Have you seen my wife, Mr. Jones?
Do you know what it's like on the outside?
Don't go talking too loud, you'll cause a landslide,
Mr. Jo - o - o - o - ones
