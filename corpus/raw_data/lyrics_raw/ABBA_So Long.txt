You think you're gonna make me softer with your fancy car
But I can tell you all your tricks ain't gonna get you far
They say that money's got a magic touch
But not to me, it doesn't mean that much
You won't have me tonight
All right, all right, all right, all right

So long, see you honey
You can't buy me with your money
Tracy, Daisy, they may be crazy
But I'll never be your girl
So long, see you honey
You can't buy me with your money
You know it's not worth trying
So long, so long, so long

You didn't have to send me flowers like you did today
I wouldn't keep a thing from you, I gave them all away
The girls might fall for everything you've got
But I'm not one of them, you know I'm not
You won't have me tonight
All right, all right, all right, all right

So long, see you honey
You can't buy me with your money
Tracy, Daisy, they may be crazy
But I'll never be your girl
So long, see you honey
You can't buy me with your money
You know it's not worth trying
So long, so long, so long

So long, see you honey
You can't buy me with your money
You know it's not worth trying
So long, so long, so long
So long, so long, so long
So long, so long, so long
