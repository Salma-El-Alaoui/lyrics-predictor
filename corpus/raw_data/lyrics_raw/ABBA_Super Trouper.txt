Super trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue
Like I always do
'Cause somewhere in the crowd theres you

I was sick and tired of everything
When I called you last night from Glasgow
All I do is eat and sleep and sing
Wishing every show was the last show

So imagine I was glad to hear youre coming
Suddenly I feel all right
(And suddenly its gonna be)
And it's gonna be so different
When I'm on the stage tonight

Tonight the super trouper lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun
Smiling, having fun
Feeling like a number one

Tonight the super trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I wont feel blue
Like I always do
'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you

Facing twenty thousand of your friends
How can anyone be so lonely
Part of a success that never ends
Still I'm thinking about you only

There are moments when I think I'm going crazy
But it's gonna be alright
(You'll soon be changing everything)
Everything will be so different
When I'm on the stage tonight

Tonight the super trouper lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun
Smiling, having fun
Feeling like a number one

Tonight the super trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue
Like I always do
'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you

So I'll be there when you arrive
The sight of you will prove to me Im still alive
And when you take me in your arms
And hold me tight
I know it's gonna mean so much tonight

Tonight the super trouper lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun
Smiling, having fun
Feeling like a number one

Tonight the super trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue
Like I always do
'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you
