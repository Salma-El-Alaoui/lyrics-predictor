I've been cheated by you since I don't know when
So I made up my mind it must come to an end
Look at me now
Will I ever learn
I don't know how
But I suddenly lose control
There's a fire within my soul

Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything
Oh oh

Mamma mia
Here I go again
My my
How can I resist ya
Mamma mia
Does it show again
My my
Just how much I've missed ya
Yes I've been brokenhearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why why
Did I ever let you go

Mamma mia
Now I really know
My my
I could never let you go

I've been angry and sad about things that you do
I can't count all the times that I told you we're through
And when you go
When you slam the door
I think you know
That you won't be away too long
You know that I'm not that strong

Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything
Whoah oh

Mamma mia
Here I go again
My my
How can I resist ya
Mamma mia
Does it show again
My my
Just how much I've missed ya
Yes I've been brokenhearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why why
Did I ever let you go

Mamma mia
Even if I said
Bye bye
Leave me now or never
Mamma mia
It's a game we play
Bye bye
Doesn't mean forever

Mamma mia
Here I go again
My my
How can I resist ya
Mamma mia
Does it show again
My my
Just how much I've missed ya
Yes I've been brokenhearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why why
Did I ever let you go

Mamma mia
Now I really know
My my
I could never let you go
