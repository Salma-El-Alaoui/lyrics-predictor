Father has a business,
Strictly second-hand,
Everything from tooth-picks to a baby grand.
Stuff in our apartment,
Came from Father's store,
Even things I'm wearing, someone wore before.
It's no wonder that I feel abused;
I never get a thing that ain't been used!

I'm wearing second-hand hats,
Second-hand clothes,
That's why the call me Second Hand Rose.
Even our piano in the parlor,
Father bought for ten cents on the dollar.
Second-hand pearls,
I'm wearing second-hand curls,
I never get a single thing that's new!
Even Jake the plumber, he's the man I adore,
Had the nerve to tell me he'd been married before!
Everyone knows that I'm just Second Hand Rose,
From Second Avenue.

I'm wearing second-hand shoes,
Second-hand hose,
All the girls hand me their second-hand beaus!
Even my pajamas, when I don them,
Have somebody else's 'nitials on them.
Second-hand rings, I'm sick of second-hand things,
I never get what other girliess do.
Once while strolling through the Ritz, a girl got my goat,
She nudged her friend and said, "Oh, look, there goes my old fur coat!"
Everyone knows that I'm just Second Hand Rose,
From Second Avenue.
