Home show, mom won't know
Run out the back door
He's passed out on the floor

Third time, been caught twice
Forgive our neighbour Bob
I think he humped the dog

But good things come to those who wait
Cause she laid me
And mom and dad possess the key - instant slavery
No need explain the plan no need to even bother
I'll pack my bags I swear I'll run - wish my friends were 21

White lies, blood shot eyes
Breath of alcohol, stole it from the mall
How's Chris marked with lipstick
Better call their fathers, sleeping with your daughters

But good things come to those who wait
Cause she laid me
And mom and dad possess the key - instant slavery
No need explain the plan no need to even bother
I'll pack my bags I swear I'll run - wish my friends were 21

You don't belong, you left the kids to carry on
You planned their fall
Too bad you're wrong, don't need a mom dad slave drive song
I time bomb

Turn low the radio, I think I hear my dad
Yelling at the band

But good things come to those who wait
Cause she laid me
And mom and dad possess the key - instant slavery
No need explain the plan no need to even bother
I'll pack my bags I swear I'll run - wish my friends were 21

You don't belong, you left the kids to carry on
You planned their fall
Too bad you're wrong, don't need a mom dad slave drive song
I time bomb
