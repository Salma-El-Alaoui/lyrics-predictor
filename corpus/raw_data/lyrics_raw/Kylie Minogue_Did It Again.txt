Clever girl
Think you are but you think too much
Shut down turn around
Don't like that way anymore

Clever girl
Think you know but you don't know much
Try to make a move
Go to a different door

You know it's all in your head
You better put that business to bed
By your fair hands of design
You met the monster in your mind

You did it again (oh-oh)
You did it again (oh-oh)
Won't you listen to me when I'm telling you
It's no good for you

Clever girl
Think you're right but what's right from wrong
Little miss genius
You make it hard on yourself

Clever girl
You've got it all but you're all messed up
Time now turn around
Move on to something else

You know it's all in your head
You better put that business to bed
What you see nobody sees
It only brings you to your knees

You did it again (oh-oh)
You did it again (oh-oh)
Won't you listen to me when I'm telling you
It's no good for you
