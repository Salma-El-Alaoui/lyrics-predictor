Flash, aah, savior of the universe
Flash, aah, he'll save every one of us

"Seemingly there is no reason for these
Extraordinary intergalactical upsets" (ha ha ha)
(What's happening Flash?)
"Only Dr. Hans Zarkov, formerly at NASA
Has provided any explanation"
Flash, aah, he's a miracle
"This mornings unprecedented solar eclipse
Is no cause for alarm"

Flash, aah, king of the impossible
He's for every one of us
Stand for every one of us
He'll save with a mighty hand
Every man, every woman, every child
With a mighty Flash

"General Kala,
Flash Gordon approaching"
"What do you mean
'Flash Gordon approaching'?
Open fire, all weapons!
Dispatch war rocket Ajax
To bring back his body!"

Flash, aah
"Gordon's alive!"
Flash, aah, he'll save ev'ry one of us
Just a man with a man's courage
He knows nothing but a man
But he can never fail
No one but the pure in heart
May find the golden grail oh, oh, oh, oh
"Flash, Flash I love you
But we only have fourteen hours
To save the Earth!"

Flash
