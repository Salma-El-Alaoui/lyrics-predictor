Im not ashamed of the things that I dream
I found myself flirting with the verge of obscene
To the unknown I will be bold
Im going to the places I can be out of control

BRIDGE
And I dont want to explain tonight
All the things I've tried to hide
I shut myself out from the world tonight
And draw the blinds
And I'll teach myself to fly

I love myself its not a sin
I can't control whats happening

CHORUS
Cuz I just discovered
Imagination's taking over
Another day without a lover
The more I come to understand
The touch of my hand

The small of my back
The arch of my feet
Lately I've been noticing the beautiful in me
The mole in my skin and i'm not going away
I'm in to myself in the most precious way
