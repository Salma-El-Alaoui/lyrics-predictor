I feel like
I've been locked up tight
for a century of lonely nights
Waiting for someone
to release me
You're lickin' your lips
and blowing kisses my way
But that don't mean
I'm gonna give it away
Baby baby baby (baby baby baby...)

Ooohhh, 'my body's sayin' lets go'
Ooohhh, 'but my heart is sayin' no'

If you wanna be with me
Baby there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle
You gotta rub me the right way

If you wanna be with me
I can make your wish come true!!
You gotta make a big impression
gotta like what you do!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I'm a genie in a bottle baby
Gotta rub me the right way honey
I'm a genie in a bottle baby
Come come, come and
on and let me out

The music's playing
and the lights are low
It's one more dance
and we're good to go
Waiting for someone who needs me
Hormones racing
at the speed of a light
But that don't mean
It's gotta be tonight
Baby baby baby (baby baby baby...)
ohhhhhhhhh
Ooohhh, 'my body's sayin' lets go
Ooohhh, 'but my heart is sayin' no'

If you wanna be with me
Baby there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle
You gotta rub me the right way

If you wanna be with me
I can make your wish come true!!
Just come and set me free baby
And I'll be with you

'I'm a genie in a bottle baby
Gotta rub me the right way honey
I'm a genie in a bottle baby
Come come, come on and let me out'

'I'm a genie in a bottle baby
Gotta rub me the right way honey (If you wanna be with me)
I'm a genie in a bottle baby
Come come, come on and let me out'

Ooohhh, 'my body's sayin' lets go'
Ooohhh, 'but my heart is sayin' no'

If you wanna be with me
Baby there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle (I'm a genie in a bottle)
You gotta rub me the right way

If you wanna be with me
I can make your wish come true
just come and set me free baby
and i'll be with you

If you wanna be with me
Baby there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle (In a bottle baby...)
You gotta rub me the right way
