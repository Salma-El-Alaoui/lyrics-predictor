It's impossible
It's impossible to love you
If you dont let me know what you're feeling
It's impossible for me to give you what you need
If you're always hidin' from me

I dont know what hurt you
But I just, I wanna make it right
'Cause boy I'm sick tired of tryin' to read your mind

Cause it's impossible (impossible)
Ooh baby it's impossible (impossible)
For me to love you this way
It's impossible (impossible)
Oh baby it's impossible (impossible)
If you're makin' it this way

Impossible to make it easy
If you're always tryin' to make it so damn hard
How can I, how can I give you all my love baby oh
If you always, always puttin' up your guard

This is not a circus
So don't ya play me for a clown
How long can emotions keep on goin' up and down oh

It's impossible (impossible)
Oh baby it's impossible (impossible)
For me to love you, this way (this way)
It's impossible (impossible)
Oh baby it's impossible (impossible)
If you keep treatin' me this way
Over, over
Impossible baby oh
If your makin' it this way
This way (this way)
Oh baby it's impossible (impossible)
If you're makin' it this way
Oh oh...
