Remember when I dove into the crowd
And I got a bloody knee under my skin, a mark from wiping out
It brings back the memories
Every bone's been broken
And my heart is still wide open

I can't stop
Don't care if I lose
Baby you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
I'm going down *in flames* for you
Baby you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
One more thing I'm addicted too

With each scar there's a map that tells a story
what a souvenir of Young love's like jumping out
An airplane riding a tidal wave on an ocean of emotion
My heart rips me wide open

I can't stop
Don't care if I lose
Baby you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
I'm going down *in flames* for you
Baby you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
One more thing I'm addicted too

And I cover up these scars
(We'll make it we'll make it but we break it)
And I can't stop seeing stars
(lets hope not die)
Whenever you're around
Around

I can't stop
Don't care if I lose
Baby you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
I'm going down in flames for you
oohhh you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
One more thing I'm addicted to

I can't stop no I can't stop
no I can't stop
Ohh I'm going out in flames
Ohh I'm going down in flames
Ohhhh
Baby you are the weapon I choose
Baby you are the weapon I choose...
