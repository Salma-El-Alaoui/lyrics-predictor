Here we are, safe at last
We can breathe a sigh, it seems the storm has passed
Through it all, no one knew
That all the tears in heaven, would bring me back to you oh
No one I know, imagined we would make it
But it only matters that we both believed, oh

Chorus:
You and me, we're a miracle
Meant to be and nothing can change it
Mountains move and oceans part
When they are standing in our way
You and me, we're a miracle
Angels stand watching over us
And heaven shines upon us everyday

Everytime I felt near defeat
You were there for me oh
On my side completely
You give me strength, oh
You set me free
It's just because of you, oh, I'm all that I can be

When I'm with you
The world is ours to reach for
Together there is nothing we can't do ohhh oh oh

Chorus:
You and me, we're a miracle
Meant to be and nothing can change it
Mountains move and oceans part
When they are standing in our way
You and me, we're a miracle
Angels stand watching over us
And heaven shines upon us everyday

The chance was so unlikely
That we would ever be, oh
Two stars among the heavens
Destiny brought you to me

Chorus:
You and me, we're a miracle
Meant to be and nothing can change it
Mountains move and oceans part
When they are standing in our way
You and me, we're a miracle
Angels stand watching over us
And heaven shines upon us everyday, ohh oh oh

You and me we're a miracle, miracle

You and me we're a miracle, miracle

Miracle....
