The only place where you can dream,
living here is not what it seems.
Ship of white light in the sky,
nobody there to reason why.

Here I am, I'm not really there,
smiling faces ever so rare.
Let's walk in deepest space
living here just isn't the place

Repeat

Leaves of green grasses twine
girls driking plasma wine
look at love and dream unfolds
living here you'll never grow old

Stalks of light grow from the ground
when i cry there isn't a sound
all my feelings cannot be held
I'm happy in my new strange world
