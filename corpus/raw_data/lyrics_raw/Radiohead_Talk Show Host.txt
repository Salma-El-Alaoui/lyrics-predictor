I want to
I want to be someone else or I'll explode
Floating upon the surface for the birds
The birds
The birds

You want me
Fucking well come and find me
I'll be waiting
With a gun and a pack of sandwiches and nothing
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing

You want me
Well come on and break the door down
You want me
Fucking come on and break the door down
I'm ready
I'm ready
I'm ready
I'm ready
I'm ready
I'm ready
