Out of winter came a warhorse of steel
I've never killed a woman before but I know how it feels
I know you'd have gone insane if you saw what I saw
So now I've got to look for Sanctuary from the law

I met up with a 'slinger last night to keep me alive
He spends all his money on gambling and guns to survive
I know you'd have gone insane if you'd saw what I saw
So now I've got to look for Sanctuary from the law

CHORUS: So give me Sanctuary from the law
And I'll be alright
Just give me Sanctuary from the law
And love me tonight..........tonight

I know you'd have gone insane if you saw what I saw
so now I've got to look for Sanctuary from the law

CHORUS: So give me Sanctuary from the law
And I'll be alright
Just give me Sanctuary from the law
And love me tonight............tonight

I can laugh at the wind
I can howl at the rain
Down in the Canyon or out on the plains

I know you'd have gone insane if you saw what I saw
so now I've to look for Sanctuary from the law

CHORUS: So give me Sanctuary from the law
And I'll be alright
Just give me Sanctuary from the law
And love me tonight...........tonight
