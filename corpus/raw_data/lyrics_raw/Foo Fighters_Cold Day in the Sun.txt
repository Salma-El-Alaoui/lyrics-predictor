Keep hiding down into your brain
And make your only cost
You just might wear your welcome out if you don't let it go.

And there's nothing that you couldn't say
Cause you said it all before
Think it's time you walk this lonely road all on your own

It's your cold day in the sun
Looks like your bleeding heart
Has already won

Wish I could take it away
And save you from yourself
You get so lost inside your head like no one else

Looking for someone to blame
Blame me all along
You'll take the heat, but you would never take the fall

It's your cold day in the sun
Looks like your bleeding heart
Has already won

You're so afraid
That you are the only one
That you are the only one
You know

Don't be afraid
Cause your not the only one
You're not the only one
I know

It's your cold day in the sun
Looks like your bleeding heart
Has already won

It's your cold day in the sun
Looks like your bleeding heart
Has already won
