This song is for lovers out there
And the little light in the trees
And all the flowers have gingivitus
And the birds fly happily

We're together once again my love
I need you back, oh baby baby

I can't explain just why we lost it from the start
Living without you girl, you'll only break my heart...

I can feel it, I can hold it
I can bend it I can shape it, I can mold it
I can cut it, I can taste it
I can spank it, beat it, masturbate it

I been looking for day glo
Always hearing the same ol'
Say you want to be faithful
I can make it do things you wouldn't think it ever could
