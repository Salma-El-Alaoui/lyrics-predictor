She can't hide no matter how hard she tries
Her secret disguised behind the lies
And at night she cries away her pride
With eyes shut tight
Staring at her inside

All her friends know why she can't sleep at night
All her family asking if she's alright
All she wants to do is get rid of this hell
Well all shes gotta do is stop kidding herself

She can only fool herself for so long
She can only fool herself for so long
She can only fool herself for so long
(I'm too weak to face me)

I never know just why you run
So far away, far away from me
I never know just why you run
So far away, far away from me

When it comes to how to live his life he can't be told
Says he's got it all under control
Thinks he knows its not a problem he's stuck with
But in reality
It'd be a problem to just quit
An addict and he can't hold the reins
The pain is worse 'cause his friends have it the same
Tries to slow down the problem he's got
But cant get off the carousel until he makes it stop

He can only fool himself for so long
He can only fool himself for so long
He can only fool himself for so long
(I'm too weak to face me)

I never know just why you run
So far away, far away from me
I never know just why you run
So far away, far away from me

Fly with me upon the wings i gave you
Try to be closer to me I'll save you
Fly with me upon the wings i gave you
Try to be closer to me I'll save you

I never know just why you run
So far away, far away from me
I never know just why you run
So far away, far away from me
