Don't get it twisted, don't get clever
This is the most craziest shit ever

Okay, this is the most craziest shit ever
Top of the charts, I wish I did feel better
So I take a two, this is before I knew
What to do? What to do? Ahh, what's that
Got a mood and I'm trippin' and my head is a block
Collecting all of the symptoms, about to call the Doc
Get ahold of yourself, you're acting odd girl
It's goin' on and on and on

What's the matter with me? I'm acting really odd
And I think you'd agree there must be something wrong
It's goin' on and on and on and on and on, uh-oh, uh-oh
What's the matter with me? I'm acting really odd
And I think you'd agree there must be something wrong
It's goin' on and on and on and on and on, uh-oh, uh-oh

Don't get it twisted, don't get clever
This is the most craziest shit ever, uh-oh, woah
Don't get it twisted, don't get clever
This is the most craziest shit ever, here we go, woah

Tick tock, I guess I'm late again
What are you suggesting there now, Gwen?
Don't you know better? What're you talking about
You know it's going to come at any point
Night time, flip-flop, this time, push my luck
He was really looking hot, anticipation building up
Space invaders, turn up all the faders, need a translator
''Pete, can you go and get a test''

Don't get it twisted, don't get clever
This is the most craziest shit ever, uh-oh, woah
Don't get it twisted, don't get clever
This is the most craziest shit ever, here we go, woah

Move that, move, move that
Move that, move, move that

Lip locked, making out again, no big deal
You always say that, but I'm not a mathematician
Twenty-eight days in a normal cycle
If I'm not mistaken, I think you might have made a goal

What's the matter with me? I'm acting really odd
And I think you'd agree there must be something wrong
It's goin' on and on and on and on and on

Don't get it twisted, don't get clever
This is the most craziest shit ever, uh-oh, woah
Don't get it twisted, don't get clever
This is the most craziest shit ever, here we go, woah
Here we go, woah
