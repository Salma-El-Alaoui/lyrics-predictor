Wait until the war is over
And we're both a little older.
The unknown soldier.

Breakfast where the news is read.
Television children fed.
Unborn living. Living dead.
Bullet strikes the helmet's head

And it's all over
For the unknown soldier.
It's all over
For the unknown soldier.

comp'nee.... halt!
present arms!

Make a grave for the unknown soldier
Nestled in your hollow shoulder.
The unknown soldier.

Breakfast where the news is read.
Television children fed.

Bullet strikes the helmet's head

And, it's all over.
The war is over.
It's all over.
The war is over.
Well, all over, baby.
All over, baby.
Oh, over, yeah.
All over, baby..
