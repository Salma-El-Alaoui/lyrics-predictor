My friend's got a girlfriend and he hates that bitch,
He tells me every day.
He says: "Man, I really gotta lose my chick
In the worst kind of a way."

She sits on her ass he works his hands to the bone
To give her money every payday.
But she wants more dinero just to stay at home.
Well, my friend, you gotta say:

"I won't pay, I won't pay ya', no way,
Na-na why don't you get a job?"
Say "No way", say "No way ya', no way,
Na-na why don't you get a job?"

I guess all this money... well, it isn't enough,
To keep the bill collectors at bay.
I guess all this money... well, it isn't enough,
'Cause that girl's got expensive taste.

"I won't pay, I won't pay ya', no way,
Na-na why don't you get a job?"
Say "No way", say "No way ya', no way,
Na-na why don't you get a job?"

Well, I guess it ain't easy doing nothing at all, oh yeah.
But, hey man, free ride's just to come on along, every day.

(Let me tell ya bout the other friend now.)

My friend's got a boyfriend and she hates that dick,
She tells me every day.
He wants more dinero just to stay at home.
Well, my friend, you gotta say:

"I won't pay, I won't pay ya', no way,
Na-na why don't you get a job?"
Say "No way", say "No way ya', no way,
Na-na why don't you get a job?"

"I won't give ya' no money, I always pay,
Na-na why don't you get a job?"
Say "No way", say "No way ya', no way,
Na-na why don't you get a joooooooob?"

Hey, that's something everyone can enjoy.
