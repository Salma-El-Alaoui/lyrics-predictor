Lovin' you's got to be (Take me to the other side)
Like the devil and the deep blue sea (Take me to the other side)
Forget about your foolish pride (Take me to the other side)
C'mon, take me to the other side (Take me to the other side)

My mama told me there'd be days like this
And man she wasn't foolin'
'Cause I just can't believe the way you kiss
Uh huh
You opened up your mouth with baited breath
You said you never leave me
You love me, you hate me, I tried to take the loss
You cryin' me a river but I got to get across

Lovin' you's got to be (Take me to the other side)
Like the devil and the deep blue sea (Take me to the other side)
Forget about your foolish pride (Take me to the other side)
Ah honey, take me to the other side (Take me to the other side)

I'm lookin' for another kind of love
Oh Lordy how I need it
The kind that likes to leap without a shove
Oh honey, best believe it
To save a lot of time and foolish pride
I'll say what's on my mind, girl
You love me, you hate me, you cut me down to size
You blinded me with love and yeah, it opened up my eyes

Lovin' you's got to be (Take me to the other side)
Like some devil and the deep blue sea (Take me to the other side)
My conscience got to be my guide (Take me to the other side)
Oh honey take me, take, take, take, take, take (Take me to the other side)

(Take me to the other side)
I'm lookin' for another kind of love
Oh Lordy how I need it
The kind that likes to leap without a shove
Honey, you best believe it
Now I ain't one for sayin' long goodbyes
I hope all is forgiven
You love me, you hate me, I used to be your lover
You know you had it comin', girl, so take me to the other (Side)
(Take me to the other side)
(Take me to the other side)

Lovin' you's got to be (Take me to the other side)
Like some devil and the deep blue sea (Take me to the other side)
You know my conscience got to be my guide (Take me to the other side)
Honey take me to the other side (Take me to the other side)

Lovin' you's got to be (Take me to the other side)
Like some devil and the deep blue sea (Take me to the other side)
Forget about your foolish pride (Take me to the other side)
Honey take me, take me, take me, take me (Take me to the other side)

(Take me to the other side)
(Take me to the other side)
(Take me to the other side)
(Take me to the other side)
