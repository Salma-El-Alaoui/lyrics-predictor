You're workin in bars, ridin in cars
Never gonna give it for free
Your apartment with a view
On the finest avenue
Lookin at your beat on the street
You're always pushin, shovin
Satisfied with nothing
You bitch you must be gettin old
So stop your love on the road
All your diggin for gold
You make me wonder
Yes I wonder
I wonder

Honey, what do you do for money
Honey, what do you do for money
How do ya get your kicks?

You're ridin on the take and you're always on the make
Squeezin all the blood out of men
They're standin in a queue just to spend the night wth you
It's business as usual again
You're always grabbin, stabbin
Tryin to get it back but girl you must be gettin slow
So stop your love on the road
All your diggin for gold
You make me wonder
Yes I wonder
Yes I wonder

Honey, what do you do for money
Honey, what do you do for money
What do you do for money honey?
How do you get your kicks?
What do you do for money honey?
How do you get your licks?

What you gonna do?
Aw what you gonna do?
