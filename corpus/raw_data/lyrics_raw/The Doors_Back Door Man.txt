Oh yeah babe
Yeah I'm a back door man
I'm a back door man
The men don't know
But the little girls understand

Hey, all you people that tryin' to sleep
I'm out to make it with my midnight dream, yeah
'Cause I'm a back door man
The men don't know
But the little girls understand
All right, yeah

You men eat your dinner, eat your pork and beans
I eat more chicken any man ever seen, yeah yeah
I'm a back door man
The men don't know
But the little girls understand

Well, I'm a back door man
I'm a back door man
Whoa, baby
I'm a back door man
The men don't know
But the little girls understand
