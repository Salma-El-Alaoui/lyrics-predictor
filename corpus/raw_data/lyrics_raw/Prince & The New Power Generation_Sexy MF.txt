In a word or 2, it's U I wanna do
No, not cha body, your mind U fool

CHORUS:
Come here baby, yeah
U sexy motherfucker

We're all alone in a villa on the Riviera
That's in France on the south side in case U cared
Out of all yo' friends, I wanna be the closest
That's why I tell U things so U'll be the mostest
When it comes 2 life, 2 be this man's wife
U got 2 be well educated on the subject of fights
I mean prevention of
In other words it's R.E.A.L. meaning of this thing called love
Are U up on this?
If so, then U can get up off a hug and a kiss

CHORUS {x2}

We need 2 talk about things, tell me what cha do
Tell me what cha eat, I might cook 4 U
See, it really don't matter cuz it's all about me and U
Ain't no one else around
I'm even with the blindfold, gagged and bound
I don't mind - see, this ain't about sex
It's all about love being in charge of this life and the next
Why all the cosmic talk?
I just want U smarter than I'll ever be when we take that walk

CHORUS {x2}

Horns, stand up please
I like it, I like it

U seem perplexed I haven't taken U yet
Can't U see I'm harder than a man could get?
I got wet dreams comin' out of my ears
I get hard if the wind blows your cologne near me
But I can take it cuz I want the whole 9
This ain't about the body, it's about the mind

CHORUS {x2}

Tommy Barbarella in the house
Scrub the dishes
Come here Tommy, yeah
Sexy, sexy, sexy, sexy
Levi, Levi, fly
Move man, getâ€¦ let's move, shit
I like it, I like it

Sexy motherfucker shakin' that ass, shakin' that ass, shakin' that ass {repeat in BG}

Guard your folks who date your daughter
The sexy motherfucker's so fine, I'll drink her bath water
A long-legged 5-foot-8 packin' an ass as tight as a grape
I wanted 2 spit my game but said 2 myself, "Hmm, just conversate" (Yeah)
Cuz I'm usually quite the calm one (Come on)
U never found me out prowlin', boy, I'm just havin' fun
But I had 2 change my state of mind 4 this behind
I bet if U throw that ass in the air, it would turn into sunshine

Sexy motherfucker shakin' that ass, shakin' that ass, shakin' that ass {x5}
(It makes 4 one sexy motherfucker up in this place)

U sexy motherfucker {repeat till end}
