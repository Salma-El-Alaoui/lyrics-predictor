Please could you stop that noise, I'm trying to get some rest
From all the unborn chicken voices in my head
What's that? (I may be paranoid, but not an android)
What's that? (I may be paranoid, but not an android)

When I am king, you will be first against the wall
With your opinion which is of no consequence at all
What's that? (I may be paranoid, but no android)
What's that? (I may be paranoid, but no android)


Ambition makes you look pretty ugly
Kicking, screaming Gucci little piggy

You don't remember
You don't remember
Why don't you remember my name?
Off with his head, man
Off with his head, man
Why don't you remember my name?
I guess he does


Rain down, rain down
Come on rain down on me
From a great height
From a great height
Height
Rain down, rain down
Come on rain down on me
From a great height
From a great height
Height

That's it sir, you're leaving (Rain down)
The crackle of pigskin (Rain down)
The dust and the screaming (Come on rain down)
The yuppies networking (On me)
The panic, the vomit (From a great height)
The panic, the vomit (From a great height)
God loves his children
God loves his children, yeah
