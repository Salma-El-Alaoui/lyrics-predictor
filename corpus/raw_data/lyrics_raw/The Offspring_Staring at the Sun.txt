Maybe life is like a ride on a freeway
Dodging bullets while you're trying to find your way
Everyone's around, but no one does a damn thing
It brings me down, but I won't let them

If I seem bleak
Well you'd be corrected
And if I don't speak
It's cause I got disconnected
But I won't be burned up by the reflection
Of the fire in your eyes
As you're staring at the sun
howooowoow
As you're staring at the sun
howooowoow
As you're staring at the sun
howooowoow
As you're staring at the sun
As you're staring at the sun!

HEY!
When I ran I didn't feel like a runaway
HEY!
When I escaped I didn't feel like I got away
HEY!
There's more to living than only surviving
Maybe I'm not there, but I'm still trying

Though you hear me
I don't think that you relate
My will is something
That you can't confiscate
So forgive me, but I won't be frustrated
By destruction in your eyes
As you're staring at the sun
howooowoow
As you're staring at the sun
howooowoow

HEY!
When I ran I didn't feel like a runaway
HEY!
When I escaped I didn't feel like I got away
HEY!
There's more to living than only surviving

Though you hear me
I don't think that you relate
My will is something
That you can't confiscate
So forgive me, but I won't be frustrated
By destruction in your eyes
As you're staring at the sun
howooowoow
As you're staring at the sun
