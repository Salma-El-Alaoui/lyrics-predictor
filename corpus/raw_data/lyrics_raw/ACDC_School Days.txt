C'mon ...

Up in the morning and out to school
The teacher is teaching the golden rule
American history and practical maths
You studyin' hard and you're hopin' to pass
Ooh you're working your fingers right down to the bone
And the guy behind you won't leave you alone

Ring ring goes the bell
The cook in the kitchen is ready to sell
But you're lucky if you can find a seat
You're fortunate if you got time to eat
Well back in the classroom open your books
Ooh the teacher don't know how mean she looks

Hail hail rock 'n' roll, hail hail rock 'n' roll
Hail hail rock 'n' roll, hail hail rock 'n' roll
Hail hail rock 'n' roll, hail hail rock 'n' roooooll

As soon as 3 o'clock goes around
You finally lay your burden down
Throw down your books and outta your seat
You go down the hallway into the street
And you're tryin' to forget just where you've been
You find a juke joint, you go in

You drop the quarter right into the slot
You gotta hear something that's really hot, like me
With the one you love you're makin' romance
All day long they wanted to dance
And you're feeling the music from head to toe
As round and round and round you go
Get over here

Long live rock 'n' roll, long live rock 'n' roll
Long live rock 'n' roll, long live rock 'n' roll
Long live rock 'n' roll, long live rock 'n' roll, hey

Rock, rock, rock 'n' roll, rock, rock, rock 'n' roll
Rock, rock, rock 'n' roll, rock, rock, rock 'n' roll
Rock, rock, rock 'n' roll, rock, rock, rock 'n' roll, c'mon

Rock, rock, rock 'n' roll, rock, rock, rock 'n' roll
Rock, rock, rock 'n' roll, rock, rock, rock 'n' roll
Rock, rock, rock 'n' roll, rock, rock, rock 'n' roll
