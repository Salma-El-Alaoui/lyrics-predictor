I might be wrong
I might be wrong
I could've sworn I saw a light coming on

I used to think
I used to think
There was no future left at all
I used to think

Open up, begin again
Lets go down the waterfall
Think about the good times and never look back
Never look back

What would I do?
What would I do?
If I did not have you

Open up, let me in
Lets go down the waterfall
Have ourselves a good time, it's nothing at all
It's nothing at all
Nothing at all

Never look back
Never look back
