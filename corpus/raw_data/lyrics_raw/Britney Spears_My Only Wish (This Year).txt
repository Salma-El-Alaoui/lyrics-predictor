O yeah

Last night i took a walk in the snow
Couples holding hands places to go
seems like everyone but me is in love
Santa can you hear me?

I signed my letter that i sealed with a kiss
i sent it off and just said this
i know exactly what i want this year

Santa can you hear me?
I want my baby ( baby baby )
i want someone to love me
and someone to hold
maybe, maybe (maybe maybe)
He'll be all my own in a big red bow

Santa can you hear me?
i have been so good this year
and all i want is one thing
tell me my true love is here
he's all i want just for me
underneath my Christmas tree
ill be waiting here
Santa thats my only wish this year

O yeah

'Cause i heard that ur comming to town
Santa can you hear me?

I really hope that your on your way
with something special
for me in your sleigh

Santa can you hear me?

and someone to hold
Maybe maybe (maybe maybe)
We'll be all alone under the mistle toe
