Used to be that I believed in something
Used to be that I believed in love
It's been a long time since I've had that feeling
I could love someone
I could trust someone
I said I'd never let nobody near my heart again darlin'
I said I'd never let nobody in

But if you asked me to
I just might change my mind
And let you in my life forever
If you asked me to
I just might give my heart
And stay here in your arms forever
If you asked me to
If you asked me to

Somehow ever since I've been around you
Can't go back to being on my own
Can't help feeling darling since I've found you
That I've found my home
That I'm finally home
I said I'd never let nobody get too close to me darling
I said I needed, needed to be free

But if you asked me to
I just might change my mind
And let you in my life forever
If you asked me to
I just might give my heart
And stay here in your arms forever
If you asked me to

If you asked me to, I will give my world to you baby
I need you now
Asked me to and I'll do anything for you baby, for you baby

If you asked me to
I'd let you in my life forever
If you asked me to
All you got to do is asked me to
All you got to do
All you got to do
All you got to do is asked me to

If you asked me to
I'll give you my world
I'll give you my heart
Everything, everything, baby
If you asked me to
Just asked me to
I'll give you everything you want me to do
Just asked me to.
