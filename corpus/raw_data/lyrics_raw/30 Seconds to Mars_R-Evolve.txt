A revolution has begun today for me inside
The ultimate defence is to pretend
Revolve around yourself just like an ordinary man
The only other option to forget

Does it feel like we’ve ever been alive?
Does it seem like it's only just begun?

To find yourself just look inside the wreckage of your past
To lose it all you have to do is lie
The policy is set and we are never turning back
It’s time for execution; time to execute
Time for execution; time to execute!

Does it feel like we’ve ever been alive?
Does it seem like it’s only just begun?
Does it feel like we’ve ever been alive inside?
Does it seem like it’s only just begun?
It’s only just begun

The evolution is coming!
A revolution has begun!
(It has begun!)
The evolution is coming!
A revolution has, yeah!

The evolution is coming!
A revolution has begun!
(It has begun!)
The evolution is coming!
A revolution has, yeah!

(Revolution…)
