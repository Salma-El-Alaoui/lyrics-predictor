couldn't keep a secret got a concrete skull
you couldn't shut up, your an imbasile
your an ugly dog
theres nothin' to gain
you couldn't shut up you had a bad bad brain

couldn't hold your tongue
you were just too young
like a two year old you told you told
you were all the same
jellybean brain
everyone's a secret nerd
everyone's a closet lame

ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma mama's boy
ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma mama's boy
ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma mama's boy

i don't wanna work in a hot dog stand
be a bus boy, messenger, or a dull man
its an abstract world, your an abstract man
abstract cities don't give a damn

couldn't keep a secret got a concrete skull
you couldn't shut up, your an imbasile
your an ugly dog
theres nothin' to gain
you couldn't shut up you had a bad bad brain

ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma mama's boy
ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma mama's boy
ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma mama's boy

ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma mama's boy
ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma mama's boy
ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma mama's boy

ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma mama's boy
ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma mama's boy
