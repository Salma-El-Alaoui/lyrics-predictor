my problem isn't that i miss you
'cause i don't
my problem isn't that i kissed you
woah, oh

i figured out
that you're nothing that i thought you're about
you're just caught in aplce
it's what time will erase in my heart

you're my type of guy i guess
if i was stuck in East Northumberland High
for the rest of my life
but people change
thank God i did

just because i liked you back then
it doesn't mean i like you now
just because i liked you back then
it doesn't mean i like you

your problem's not lack of trying
'cause you do
it's just that you're at your best when you're lying
woah, oh

now you're standing here
and saying things you think i wanted to hear
but you got it all wrong
i've already moved on, my dear

you're my type of guy i guess
if i was stuck in East Northumberland High
for the rest of my life
but people change
thank God i did

just because i liked you back then
it doesn't mean i like you now
just because i liked you back then
it doesn't mean i like you

when you're standing near me
i don't see so clearly
the feelings are still helpable
but when i take two steps away
it takes some light on my day

yeah, you can't go back
it's all in the past
guess you gotta laugh at it

you're my type of guy i guess
if i was stuck in East Northumberland High
for the rest of my life
but people change
thank God i did

and if there's some confusion
let me tell ya you're just delusional
get a clue
people chance
thank God i did
thank God i did
thank God i did

just because i liked you back then
it doesn't mean i like you now
just because i liked you back then
it doesn't mean i like you
doesn't mean i like you now

just because i liked you back then
it doesn't mean i like you now
