There's somethin' about the way
The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement
Walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot
Yeah
Oh, yeah

We're drivin' down the road
I wonder if you know
I'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool
Run your hands through your hair
Absentmindedly makin' me want you

And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don't know why, but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress
Fearless

So, baby, drive slow
'Til we run out of road in this one-horse town
I wanna stay right here in this passenger's seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now capture it, remember it

'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don't know why, but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress
Fearless

Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake
I'm not usually this way, but
You pull me in and I'm a little more brave
It's the first kiss
It's flawless
Really something
It's fearless

Oh, yeah
And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don't know why, but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress
Fearless

Yeah
I don't know how
Oh, yeah, yeah
