Covered in sinners and dripping with guilt
Making you money from slime and from filth.
Parading your bellies in ivory towers
Investing our lives in your schemes and your powers.

You got to watch them - Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in heaven - The thief in your head.
You've got to watch them - Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in heaven - The thief in your head.

Be quick or be dead - Be quick or be dead
See... what's ruling all our lives
See... who's pulling the strings...
I bet you won't fall on your face...
Your belly will hold you in place.

The serpent is crawling inside of your ear
He says you must vote for what you want to hear.
Don't matter what's wrong as long as you're alright
So pull yourself stupid and rob yourself blind.
