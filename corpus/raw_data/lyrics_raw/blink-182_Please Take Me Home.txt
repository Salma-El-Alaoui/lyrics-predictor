Oh no, it happened again
She's cool, she's hot, she's my friend
I'd try for hours, if so
You leave me nowhere to go

She's unstoppable
Unpredictable
I'm so jaded, calculated.
Wrong

Please take me home
Too late, it's gone
I bet you're sad
This is the best time we ever had

I hope, hope that it lasts
Give in, forget the past
Be strong when things fall apart
Honest, this breaks my heart

She's unstoppable
Unpredictable
I'm so jaded, calculated
Wrong

Please take me home
Too late, it's gone
I bet you're sad
This is the best time we ever had

Please take me home
Too late, it's gone
I bet you're sad
This is the best time we ever had

Why did we have to go date?
It's too easy to complicate
Be strong when things fall apart (be strong when things fall apart)
Honest, this breaks my heart.(its so hard)
LETS GO!

Please take me home
Too late, it's gone
I bet you're sad
This is the best time we ever had
