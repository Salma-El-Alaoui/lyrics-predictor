Yeah
Aight, let's go
Gimme your love( 16x)
Hey, you gotta bounce to this like this
You're almost kinda watching this
Uh-huh
Whoo oo oo
Escape
Oh you look so good
I don't wanna let go
And although I should
I can't leave you alone
'Cause your so disarming
I'm caught-up in the midst
of you and I can not resist at all
(Chorus 1):
Boy If I do
The things you want me too
The way I used to do
Would you love me baby
Holding me feelin' you
Could you go and break my heart?
(Chorus 2):
Heartbreaker you've got the best of me
but I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh why did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known right from the start
you'd go and break my heart
(Gimme your love)--8x
It's a shame to be
so euphoric and weak
when you smile at me
and you tell me the things
that you know are stated
to relinquish my love to you
but I can not resist at all
(Chorus 1):
Boy If I do
The things you want me too
The way I used to do
Would you love me baby
Holding me feelin' you
Could you go and break my heart?
(Chorus 2):
Heartbreaker you've got the best of me
but I just keep on coming back incessently
Oh why did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known right from the start
you'd go and break my heart
(JAY-Z RAP):
OK
Cool
Aight
Yo
She wanna shop wit Jay
play box wit Jay
She wanna pillowfight in the middle of the night
She wanna drive my Benz with five of her friends
She wanna creep past the block, spyin' again
She wanna roll wit Jay, chase skeeos away
She wanna fight wit lame chicks, blow my day
She wanna respect the rest, kick me to the curb
if she find one strand a hair longer than hers
She want
make love in the Jacuzzi
Rub up in the movies
Access to the old crib,
keys to da newbie
She wanna
answer the phone
tatoo her arm
last one I got her
sent it back to her mom
She call me Heartbreaker
when we apart it makes her
wanna piece of paper,
scribble down I hate ya
But she know she love Jay because
she love everything Jay say Jay does, and a...
Heartbreaker you've got the best of me
but I just keep on coming back incessently
Oh why did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known right from the start
you'd go and break my heart
Heartbreaker you've got the best of me
but I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh why did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known right from the start
you'd go and break my heart
