It's so hot in here

Oh, it's so hot and I need some air
And boy, don't stop cause I'm halfway there

It's not complicated
We're too syncopated
We can read each other's minds
One love invited, two bodies sychronizin'
Don't even need to touch me, baby

Just...

- Chorus -
Breathe on me
Yeah, oh baby, just
Breathe on me
We don't need to touch just
Breathe

Oh, Yeah

Oh, this is way beyond the physical (way beyond the physical)
Tonight, my senses don't make sense at all

Our imagination takin' us to places
We have never been before
Take me in, let it out
Don't even need to touch me, baby

Just...

- Chorus x2-

Oh
Monogamy is the way to go
Just put your lips together
And blow

Breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe x4

- Chorus x2 -
