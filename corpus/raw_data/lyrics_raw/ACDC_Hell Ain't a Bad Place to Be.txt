Hey you, yeah you

Sometimes I think this woman is kinda hot
Sometimes I think this woman is sometimes not
Puts me down, fool me around
Why she do it to me
Out for satisfaction
Any piece of action
That ain't the way it should be

She needs lovin'
Knows I'm the man
She's gotta see
Pours my beer
Licks my ear
Brings out the devil in me
Hell ain't a bad place to be

Spends my money
Drinks my booze
Stays out every night
But I got to thinkin', hey just a minute
Somethin' ain't right
All this disillusions and confusion
Make me wanna cry
Oh the shame you, playin' your games
Tellin' me those lies

Don't mind her playin' demon
Long as it's with me
If this is hell
Then you could say
It's heavenly
Hell ain't a bad place to be

Late at night
Turns down the light
Closes up on me
Opens my heart
Tears me apart
Brings out the devil in me

Hell ain't no bad place to be
I said hell ain't no bad place to be
Hell ain't no bad place to be
Hell ain't no bad place to be
