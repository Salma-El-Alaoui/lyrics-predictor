Free me right now
You take me away, take it from me
Free me right now
You take me away, take it from me, yeah!

Beautiful prisoner, left here for dead
Promises made and sentences read
Voices and visions are locked in my head
Like a saint full of sorrow.
All of the words that we dared never speak
All of our ghosts and the secrets we keep
Gather them all and we'll bury them deep
Like a saint full of sorrow.

Free me right now
You take me away, take it from me
Free me right now
You take me away, take it from me, hey!

One for forever
One in the name
Once to remember
We're one and the same
One to forget but it always remains
Like a saint full of sorrow

Free me right now
You take me away, take it from me
Free me right now
You take me away, take it from me
Can you free what's keepin' you?
Well I need somebody to:

Free me! Free me!
Free me! Free me!
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh

Free me right now
You take me away, take it from me
Free me right now
You take me away, take it from me
Can you free what's keepin' you?
Well I need somebody to:

Free me! Free me!
Free me! Free me!
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, yeah!
