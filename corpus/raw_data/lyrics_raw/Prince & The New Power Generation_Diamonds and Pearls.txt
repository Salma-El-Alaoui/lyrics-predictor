This will be the day
That you will hear me say
That I will never run away
I am here for you
Love is meant for two
Now tell me what you're gonna do

CHORUS
If I gave you diamonds and pearls
Would you be a happy boy or a girl
If I could I would give you the world
But all I can do is just offer you
My love

Which one of us is right
If we always fight
Why can't we just let love decide
(Let love decide)
Am I the weaker man
Because I understand
That love must be the master plan

CHORUS

BRIDGE
D to the I to the A to the M
O to the N to the D to the pearls of love
D to the I to the A to the M
O to the N to the D to the pearls of love

There will come a time
(Thery'll come a time)
When you will blow your mind
(Your mind)
And everything you look for you'll find
(Take a look inside)
There will be the time
(Thery'll be the time)
When everything will shine
(Oh yeah)
So bright it makes you color blind
(You will be color blind)

CHORUS X 2 TO FADE
