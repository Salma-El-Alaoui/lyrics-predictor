''Tarzan and Jane were swingin' on a vine''
Candyman, Candyman
''Sippin’ from a bottle of vodka double wine''

[Whispered] Sweet sugar candy man

Hey, Yeah

I met him out for dinner on a Friday night
He really had me working up an appetite
He had tattoos up and down his arm
There's nothing more dangerous than a boy with charm

He's a one stop shop, makes the panties drop
He's a sweet-talkin', sugar coated candy man
A sweet-talkin', sugar coated candyman

Ooo yeah..

He took me to the Spider Club at Hollywood and Vine
We drank champagne and we danced all night
We shook the paparazzi for a big surprise (a big surprise)
The gossip tonight will be tomorrow's headline (oooh..)

He's a one stop shop, makes my cherry pop
He's a sweet-talkin', sugar coated candyman
A sweet-talkin', sugar coated candyman

He's a sweet-talkin', sugar coated candyman oh
A sweet-talkin', sugar coated candyman

Woo yeah

Well by now I'm getting all bothered and hot
When he kissed my mouth he really hit the spot
He had lips like sugar cane
Good things come to boys who wait

''Tarzan and Jane were swingin' on a vine''
Candy man Candy man
''Sipping from a bottle of vodka double wine''
Candy man, candy man

[Whispered] Sweet sugar candy man
He's a one stop, gotcha hot, making all the panties drop

He's a one stop, got me hot, making my uh pop

Good things come for boys who wait
