Once upon a time there was a girl
In her early years she had to learn
How to grow up living in a war that she called home
Never knew just where to turn for shelter from the storm
It hurt me to see the pain across my mother's face
Every time my father's fists would put her in her place
Hearing all the yelling I would cry up in my room
Hoping it would be over soon

(Chorus)
Bruises fade father but the pain remains the same
And I still remember how you kept me so afraid
Strength is my mother for all the love she gave
And every morning that I wake I look back on yesterday
And I'm OK

I often wonder why I carry all this guilt
When it's you that helped me put up all these walls I've built
Shadows stir at night through a crack in the door
The echoes of a broken child screaming please no more
Daddy don't you understand the damage you have done
For you it's just a memory but for me it still lives on

(Chorus)
Bruises fade father but the pain remains the same
And I still remember how you kept me so, so afraid
Strength is my mother for all the love she gave
Every morning that I wake I look back on yesterday

It's not so easy to forget, all the marks you left along her neck
When I was thrown against cold stairs
And everyday afraid to come home in fear of what I might see, next

(Chorus)
Bruises fade father but the pain remains the same
And I still remember how you kept me so afraid
Strength is my mother for all the love you gave
And every morning that I wake, I look back on yesterday
And I'm OK
