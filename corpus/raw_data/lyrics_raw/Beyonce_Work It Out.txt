How ya doin�, honey baby
You know I don't ask for much
But for a girl spendin� time alone
Can be pretty rough

But I get a knock on my door
I know it's yours for sure
We can't wait for the bedroom
So we just hit the floor

Is y'all alright
I don't know, but I know what's happened
to me, girl, hey

Uh, break it down now

Damn blow ya horn now.
C'mon, damn blow ya horn now
Damn blow ya horn now

So we're shakin� back and forth now
Just keep it comin�, babe
Treat my body like a guitar
You gotta, you gotta keep on strummin�

But in the back of my mind, I wonder
Is it gonna be the last time
Well, if it ain't about the lovin and you gon� keep it
comin�
Well, baby, with me that's fine

Is y'all alright
I don't know, but I know what's happened
To me, girl
Is y'all alright
Uh, break it down now
