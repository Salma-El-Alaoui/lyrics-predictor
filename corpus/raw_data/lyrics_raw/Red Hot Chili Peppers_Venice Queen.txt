Does it go from east to west
Body free and a body less
Come again just to start a-fresh
Once again to find a home
In the moment of the meantime

Dropping in, coming through the mesh
Checking in just to get it blessed
Hard to leave when it's picturesque
Find a form that's free to roam
Where you come from
Where you going

Where you come from
Where you going

Do it all then it all again
Make it up and you make a friend
Paddle on just around the bend
Find a place where you can see
All the mamas and the papas

Take a chance on a recommend
Hard as hell just to comprehend
Disbelief that I do suspend
Easy now to find a breeze
Where you come from
Where you going

Where you come from
Where you going

We all want to tell her
Tell her that we love her
Venice gets a queen
Best I've ever seen

We all want to kiss her
Tell her that we miss her
Venice gets a queen
Best I've ever

I know you said you don't believe
In godâ€”do you still disagree?
Now that it's time for you to leave
G.L.O.R.I.A is love
My friend
My friend
My friend

Your stylish mess of silver hair
A woman of your kind is rare
Your uniform returns to air
G.L.O.R.I.A
Is love my friend

And now it's time for you to go
You taught me most of what I know
Where would I be without you, Glo?
G.L.O.R.I.A. is love
My friend
My friend
My friend

I see you standing by the sea
The waves you made will always be
A kiss goodbye before you leave
G.L.O.R.I.A is love
My friend
My friend
My friend
