What do I got to do to make you love me
What do I got to do to make you care
What do I do when lightning strikes me
And awake to find that you are not there

What do I got to do to make you want me
What do I got to do to be heard
what do I say when it's all over
Sorry seems to be the hardest word

chorus:
It's sad (so sad) so sad
It's a sad sad situation
And it's getting more and more absurd
It's sad (so sad) so sad
Why can't we talk it over
Oh, it seems to me
that sorry seems to be the hardest word

It's sad (so sad) so sad
It's a sad sad situation
And it's getting more and more absurd
It's sad (so sad) so sad
Why can't we talk it over
Oh, it seems to me
that sorry seems to be the hardest word

what do I do to make you love me
what do I got to do to be heard
What do I do when lightning strikes me
What have I got to do? (2x)

When sorry seems to be the hardest word...
