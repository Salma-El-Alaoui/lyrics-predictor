Sky was blue and high above
The moon was new and so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover, where can you be
It came at last love had its day
The day is past, you've gone away
This eager heart of mine is singing
Lover, come to me
I remember every little thing you used to do
I-I'm lonely
Every road I walk along,
I've walked along with you
No wonder I am lonely
The sky is blue, the night is cold
The moon is new, but love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover, come to me
When I remember every little thing you used to do
Huh-huh...I'm lonely
Every road I walk along,
I've walked along with you
No wonder I am lonely
The sky is blue, the night is cold
The moon is new, but love is old
And while I'm standing here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover, lover, get here to me...
Now!!!
