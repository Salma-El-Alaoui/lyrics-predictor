I wish I could believe you,then I'd be alright
But now everything you told me really don't apply
To the way I feel inside,loving you was easy once upon a time
But now my suspicions of you have multiplied
and its all because you lied,I only give you a hard time, cause I cant go on and pretend like, I havn't tried to forget this,
but I'm much too full of resentment
Just can't seem to get over the way you hurt me I dont know how you gave another who didn't mean a thing the very thing you gave to me I thought I could forgive you and I know you've changed as much as I wanna trust you I know it ain't the same and it's all because you lied I only give you a hard time, cause I cant go on and pretend like, I havn't tried to forget this,
but I'm much too full of resentment
I'll always remember feeling like I was no good like I could do it for you like no mistress could and it's all because you lied I only give you a hard time, cause I cant go on and pretend like, I havn't tried to forget this,
but I'm too damn full of resentment
I know she was attractive but I was here first
I been riding with you for 6 years
why did I deserve to be treated this way by you I know you prolly thinking
Whats up wit "B" I been crying too long what did you do to me I use to be so strong now you took my soul and I'm crying can't stop crying can't stop crying
You could've told me you wasn't happy I know you didn't wanna hurt me but look what you done , done to me now
I gotta look at her in her eyes and see she's had half of me
How could you lie
