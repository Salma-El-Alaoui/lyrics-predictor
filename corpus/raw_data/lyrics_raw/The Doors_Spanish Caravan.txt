Carry me, caravan.
Take me away.
Take me to Portugal.
Take me to Spain.
Andalucia
With fields full of grain,
I have to see you
Again and again.
Take me, Spanish caravan.
Yes, I know you can.

Trade winds find Galleons
Lost in the sea.
I know where treasure
Is waiting for me.
Silver and gold
In the mountains of Spain,
I have to see you
Again and again.
Take me, Spanish caravan.
Yes, I know you can.
