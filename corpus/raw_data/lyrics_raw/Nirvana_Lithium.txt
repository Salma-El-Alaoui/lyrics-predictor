I'm so happy 'cause today
I found my friends...
They're in my head
I'm so ugly, that's okay, 'cause so are you...
We broke our mirrors
Sunday morning is everyday for all I care...
And I'm not scared
Light my candles, in a daze
'Cause I've found god
yeah yeah

I'm so lonely, that's okay, I shaved my head...
And I'm not sad
And just maybe I'm to blame for all I've heard...
But I'm not sure
I'm so excited, I can't wait to meet you there...
But I don't care
I'm so horny, that's okay...
My will is good
