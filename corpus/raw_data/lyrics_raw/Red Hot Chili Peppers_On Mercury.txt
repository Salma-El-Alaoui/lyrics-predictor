I've got myself
in a masochistic hold
why don't you let go
shake it off
just to redirect my flow
come on let's go

Sit up straight
I'm on a double date
I've got to find my way
into the light heavy middle weight
we don't stop rock around the clock
motor mouthing off
in front of every other road block

come again and tell me
what you're going through
like a girl who only knew
her child was due

memories of everything
of lemon trees on mercury
come to me with remedies
from five or six of seven seas
you always took me with a smile
when I was down
memories of everything
that blew through

looking up into
a reverse vertigo
what an undertow
give it up
another stubborn scorpio
come on, let's go

Sit up straight
I'm on a double date
I've got to find my way
into the light heavy middle weight
we don't stop rock around the clock
motor mouthing off
in front of every other road block

Come again and tell me
what you're going through
like a girl who only knew
her child was due

to the moon she gave
another good review
turn around and look at me
it's really really you

memories of everything
of lemon trees on mercury
come to me with remedies
from five or six of seven seas
you always took me with a smile
when I was down
memories of everything
that blew through

Sit up straight
I'm on a double date
I've got to find my way
into the light heavy middle weight
we don't stop rock around the clock
motor mouthing off
in front of every other road block

memories of everything
of lemon trees on mercury
come to me with remedies
from five or six of seven seas
you always took me with a smile
when I was down

that blew through
