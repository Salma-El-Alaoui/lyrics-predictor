If I could have my wasted days back
Would I use them to get back on track?
Stop to warm at Karmas burning
Or look ahead, but keep on turning?

Do I have the strength
To know how I'll go?
Can I find it inside
To deal with what I shouldn't know?

Could I have my wasted days back
Would I use them to get back on track?

I've worn out always being afraid
An endless stream of fear that I've made
Treading water full of worry
This frantic tick tick talk of hurry

Do I have the strength
To know how I'll go?
Can I find it inside
To deal with what I shouldn't know?

My lifestyle (birth is pain)
Determines my deathstyle (Life is pain)
A rising tide (Death is pain)
That pushes to the other side (It's all the same)
