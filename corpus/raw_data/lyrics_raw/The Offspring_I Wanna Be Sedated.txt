20-20-20-4 hours to go
i wanna be sedated
nothing to do, nowhere to go, ho
i wanna be sedated

just get me to the airport, put me on a plane
hurry,hurry,hurry before i go insane
i can't control my fingers, i can't control my brain
oh no, oh oh, oh oh

20-20-20-4 hours to go
i wanna be sedated
nothing to do, nowhere to go, ho
i wanna be sedated

just put me in a wheelchair, put me on a plane
hurry hurry hurry before i go insane
i can't control my fingers, i can't control my brain
oh no oh oh oh oh

20-20-20-4 hours to go
i wanna be sedated
nothin' to do, nowhere to go, ho
i wanna be sedated

just put me in a wheelchair, get me to the show
hurry hurry hurry before i go loco
i can't control my fingers, i can't control my toes
oh no oh oh oh oh
