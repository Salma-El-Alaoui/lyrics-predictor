Been thinking about you, your records are here
Your eyes are on my wall, your teeth are over there
But I'm still no-one, and you're now a star
What do you care?

Been thinking about you, and there's no rest
Shit I still love you, still see you in bed
But I'm playing with myself, and what do you care
When the other men are far, far better

All the things you've got
All the things you need
Who bought you cigarettes
Who bribed the company to come and see you honey?

I've been thinking about you, so how can you sleep?
These people aren't your friends, they're paid to kiss your feet
They don't know what I know and why should you care
When I'm not there

Been thinking about you, and there's no rest
Should I still love you, still see you in bed
But I'm playing with myself, what do you care
When I'm not there

All the things you've got
She'll never need
All the things you've got
I've bled and I bleed to please you

Been thinking about you
