Three in the morning and I gotta be someplace
I don't remember where
Friends try to make me stay or call me a cab home
I grab my keys and a beer

The cops they took my license away
But I got my car out of impound today
And I've been drunk since last Saturday
You'd better stay outta my way

I drink and drive
Feel so alive
I'll never take that dive
Feel so alive
I'm doin' ninety-five
I drink and drive
I feel so alive
I drink and drive

Early morning and the freeway's deserted
Like it's all mine
I'm trying to set a new driving speed record
But I can't drive a straight line
Flashing lights
Split the night
I'm tossing bottles as I swerve to the right
Now I've slammed my face into the back of a big-rig
At least you'll never catch me you fucking pigs

I drink and drive
Feel so alive
I'll never take that dive
Feel so alive
I'm doin' ninety-five
I drink and drive
I feel so alive
I drink and drive

Designate someone other than me
I'm so drunk I can hardly see
Another shot of jagger and I turn the key
I got so many places to be

When I'm on a binge, my friends all cringe
They won't drive at night
Cause down at the freeway it's such a fright
But I think I drive alright

The cops they took my license away
But I got my car out of impound today
And I've been drunk since last Saturday
You'd better stay outta my way

I drink and drive
Feel so alive
I'll never take that dive
Feel so alive
I'm doin' ninety-five
I drink and drive
I feel so alive
I drink and drive

When I'm on a binge, my friends all cringe
They won't drive at night
Cause down at the freeway it's such a fright
But I think I drive alright
