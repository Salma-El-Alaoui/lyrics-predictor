Baby, I'm so into you
You've got that something what can I do?
Baby, you spin me around, ...oh
The earth is movin, but I can't feel the ground
Every time you look at me
My heart is jumpin', it's easy to see

You drive me crazy
I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Ohh, Ohh, Ohh... Crazy, but it feels all right
Baby thinking of you keeps me up all night
Oh, Oh, Oh..

Tell me you're so into me
That I'm the only one you will see
Tell me I'm not in the blue, ...oh
That I'm not wastin'
My feelins on you
lovin' you means so much more
More than anything I've ever felt before

You drive me crazy
I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Ohh, Ohh, Ohh... Crazy, but it feels all right
Baby thinking of you keeps me up all night

Crazy, I just can't sleep. I'm so excited I'm into deep.
Crazy, but it feels all right. Every day and every night.

You drive me crazy
(You drive me crazy, baby)
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Ohh, Ohh...
Crazy
(You make me feel all right)
Baby thinking of you keeps me up all night

You drive me crazy
(You drive me crazy, baby)
yeah yeah yeah
oh oh oh...
Crazy
but it feels all right
Baby thinking of you keeps me up all night

Baby thinking of you keeps me up all night
