Friday morning

And all my work is done

I've packed my bags

I'm on the run

I got a feeling that

I'm gonna have some

Fun in the sun

With my friends

And he's got me going



Whoops now

Sorry I can't go

Whoops now

Sorry I can't go

Whoops now

Sorry I can't go

Sorry I can't go

Sorry I can't go now



Friday noon

And my boss is on the phone

He's telling me

That I can't leave home

An extra hand at work

Is what he called for

He said we need you here

Tell my friends I'm going



Whoops now

Sorry I can't go

Whoops now

Sorry I can't go

Whoops now

Sorry I can't go

I don't know why

My job has called me in



It makes no difference

If you love work or not

If you dream your holiday

Hand on a door knob

Out with your friends and

Fun in the sun now

That's when the phone rings

Friday evening and I'm all alone at home

And all my friends are having fun

Another week and I'll leave the machine on

Next time he calls

He'll hear my voice

Saying nice and clear



Whoops now

Sorry I can't go

Whoops now

Sorry I can't go

Whoops now

Sorry I can't go

I'm out having fun in the sun

With my friends



Whoops now

Sorry I can't go

Whoops now

Sorry I can't go

Whoops now

Sorry I can't go

I'm out having fun in the sun

With my friends

With my friends

With my friends

With my friends

With my friends
