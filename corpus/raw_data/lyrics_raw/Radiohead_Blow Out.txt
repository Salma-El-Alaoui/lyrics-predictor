In my mind and nailed into my heels
All the time killing what I feel

And everything I touch
[All wrapped up in cotton wool]
[All wrapped up and sugar coated]
Turns to stone

And everything I touch
[All wrapped up in cotton wool]
[All wrapped up and sugar coated]
Turns stone

I am fused just in case I blow out
I am glued just because I crack out

Everything I touch turns to stone
Everything I touch
[All wrapped up in cotton wool]
[All wrapped up and sugar coated]
