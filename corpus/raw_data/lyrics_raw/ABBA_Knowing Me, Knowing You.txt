No more carefree laughter
Silence ever after
Walking through an empty house, tears in my eyes
Here is where the story ends, this is goodbye

Knowing me, knowing you
There is nothing we can do
Knowing me, knowing you
We just have to face it, this time we're through

Breaking up is never easy, I know but I have to go
Knowing me, knowing you
It's the best I can do

Memories, good days, bad days
They'll be with me always
In these old familiar rooms children would play
Now there's only emptiness, nothing to say

Knowing me, knowing you
There is nothing we can do
Knowing me, knowing you
We just have to face it, this time we're through

Breaking up is never easy, I know but I have to go
Knowing me, knowing you
It's the best I can do

Knowing me, knowing you
There is nothing we can do
Knowing me, knowing you
We just have to face it, this time we're through

Breaking up is never easy, I know but I have to go
Knowing me, knowing you
It's the best I can do
