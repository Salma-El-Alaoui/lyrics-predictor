I feel my heartbeat,
when you run your fingers through my hair, oh yeah
I can tell you,
I can feel you by my side when you're not there, oh yeah
Just as my life fades to darkness
you you make me see the light.
Show me that my search is over
I pay the price, I pay the price.

Tell you someday, baby you and I should be one, one.
Do it always, brighter than the eye can see, we hide the sun.

The taste of love is sweet, like honey on the vine,
like the wind that feeds the fire, two souls become entwined.
Someday baby you and I should be one, one.

VERSE 2:
So I'm standing 'round this corner
Tall enough to touch the New York sky, oh yeah
My love is so blind
I just cannot hear or see the world go by, oh yeah
Someone can love so completely
One kiss should break the seal.
Truth can be stranger than fiction
This love is real
This love is real.

Tell you someday Baby, you and I should be one, one.
Do it always, brighter than the eye can see, we hide the sun.

BRIDGE:
Ah we are one, we are one.

VERSE 3:
I will follow
Count on me, I'll never let you down, oh yeah
My devotion
If love is an ocean I'll surely drown, oh yeah
You'll be my only possession
I'll be a slave to you
We hold the power together
Just me and you
Just me and you.

Tell you someday Baby, you and I should be one, one.
Do it always, brighter than the eye can see, we hide the sun.
Tell you someday Baby, you and I should be one, one.

[You know my life is in your hands,
and every breath you take is planned
and all this love goes on forever.]

Tell you someday Baby, you and I should be one, one.
Do it someday Baby, you and I should be one, one.
Do it someday Baby, you and I should be one, one.... (Repeat to Fade)
