I can't light no more of your darkness
All my pictures seem to fade to black and white
I'm growing tired and time stands still before me
Frozen here on the ladder of my life

It's much too late to save myself from falling
I took a chance and changed the way of life
But you misread my meaning when I met you
Closed the door and left me blind by the light

Don't let the sun go down on me yeah
Although I search myself it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free ohh
But losing everything is like the sun going down on me

(Ladies &amp; gentleman Mr. Elton John)
I can't find oh the right romantic line
But see me once and see the way I feel
Don't discard me just because you think I mean you harm
But these cuts I have they need love to help them heal oh

Don't let the sun go down on me yeah
Although I search myself it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free ohh
Cause losing everything is like the sun going down on me

Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself it's always someone else I see yeah
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free baby
Cause losing everything is like the sun going down on me
(Mr. Elton John)
