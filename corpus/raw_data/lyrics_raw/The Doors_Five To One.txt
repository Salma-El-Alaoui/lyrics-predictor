Five to one, baby
One in five
No one here gets out alive
Now, you get yours, baby
I'll get mine
Gonna make it baby if we try

The old get old, baby
And the young get stronger
May take a week and it may take longer
They got the guns but, we got the numbers
Gonna win yeah, we're takin' over!
Come on

Your ballroom days are over, baby
Night is drawin' near
Shadows of the evenings
Crawl across the years
You walk across the floor
With a flower in your hand
Tryin' to tell me no one understands
Trade in your hours for a handful of dimes
Gonna make it baby in our prime
Come together one more time
Come together one more time

Get together one more time
Get together one more time
Get together one more time
Get together one more time
Get together one more time
Get together one more time
Get together one more time
