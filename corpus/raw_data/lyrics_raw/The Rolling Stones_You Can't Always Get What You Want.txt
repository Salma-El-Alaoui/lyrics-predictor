I saw her today at the reception
A glass of wine in her hand
I knew she would meet her connection
At her feet was her footloose man

No, you can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometime, you'll find
You get what you need

I saw her today at the reception
A glass of wine in her hand
I knew she would meet her connection
At her feet was her footloose man

You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometime, well you might find
You get what you need

I went down to the demonstration
To get my fair share of abuse
Singin' we're gonna vent our frustration
If we don't we're gonna blow a 50-amp fuse
Sing it to me

You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes, well you just might find
You get what you need

I went down to the Chelsea drug store
To get your prescription filled
I was standin' in line with Mr. Jimmy
And man, did he look pretty ill

We decided that we would have a soda
My favourite flavour, cherry red
I sung my song to Mr. Jimmy
Yeah, and he said one word to me, and that was "dead"
I said to him

You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes, you just might find
You get what you need

You get what you need

I saw her today at the reception
In her glass was a bleeding man
She was practiced at the art of deception
Well I could tell by her blood-stained hands

You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes, you just might find, you just might find
You get what you need

You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes, you just might find, you just might find
You get what you need
