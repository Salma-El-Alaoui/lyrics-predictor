Ah...

I never fell in love so easily.
Where the four winds blow I carry on.
I'd like to take you where my spirit flies,
through the empty skies.
We go alone.
Never before
having flown

Faster than lightening is this heart of mine.
In the face of time I carry on.
I'd like to take you where my rainbow ends.
Be my lover friend.
We go alone.
Never before
having flown.

I am your hurricane,
your fire in the sun.
How long must I live
in the air?

You are my paradise,
my angel on the run.
How long must I wait?
It's the dawn of the feeling
that starts from the moment you're there.

You'll never know what you have done for me.
You broke all those rules I live upon.
I'd like to take you to my shangri-la,
neither here or far,
away from home.
Never before
having flown.

I am your hurricane,
your fire in the sun.
How long must I live
in the air?

You are my paradise,
my angel on the run.
How long must I wait?
It's the dawn of the feeling
that starts from the moment you're there.

There I'd like to take you where my spirit flies
through the empty skies.
We go alone.
Never before
having flown.
