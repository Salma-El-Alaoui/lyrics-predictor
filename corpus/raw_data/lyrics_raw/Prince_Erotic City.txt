I... I... I... I...
Erotic City
Erotic City

All of my purple life
I've been lookin' 4 a dame
That would wanna be my wife
That was my intention main

CHORUS:
If we cannot make babies
Maybe we can make some time
Fuck so pretty, U and me
Erotic City come alive
We could fuck until the dawn
Makin' love 'til cherry's gone
Erotic City, can't U see?
Fuck so pretty, U and me

Everytime I comb my hair
Thoughts of U get in my eyes
U're a sinner, I don't care
I just want your creamy thighs

CHORUS

All of my hang-ups are gone
How I wish U felt the same
We could fuck until the dawn (Until the dawn {x2})
How I wish U were my dame (Baby, won't U be my dame?)

CHORUS

Uh, whoa whoa, whoa whoa, whoa whoa whoa (Mmmm)
Whoa whoa, whoa whoa, whoa whoa whoa {x2}

Baby, U're so creamy

If we cannot make babies
Maybe we can make some time (Oh yeah)
Fuck so pretty, U and me
Erotic City come alive
We could fuck until the dawn (Come alive)
Makin' love 'til cherry's gone
Erotic City, can't U see?
Fuck so pretty, U and me

If we cannot make babies (U and me)
Maybe we can make some time
Some time, some time, some time, Erotic City
If we cannot make babies
Maybe we can make some time
Fuck so pretty, U and me
Erotic City come alive (I.. I.. I..)
We could fuck until the dawn (Come alive)
Makin' love 'til cherry's gone
Erotic City, can't U see?
Fuck so pretty, U and me
(Baby, U're just so.. U're just so..)
We could fuck until the dawn
Makin' love 'til cherry's gone
Erotic City, yeah

I... I... I... I...
Erotic City, yeah
