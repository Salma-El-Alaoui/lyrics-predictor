Love is a razor and I walked the line on that silver blade
Slept in the dust with his daughter, her eyes red with
The slaughter of innocence
And I will pray for her
I will call her name out loud
I would bleed for her
If I could only see her now

Living on a razors edge
Balancing on a ledge
Living on a razors edge, Oaah
Balancing on a ledge
Balancing on a ledge
Living on a razors edge
Balancing on a ledge... You know, You know

The evil that men do lives on and on...
The evil that men do lives on and on...
The evil that men do lives on and on...
The evil that men do lives on and on...
The evil that men do lives on and on...

Circle of fire my baptism of joy at an end it seems
The seventh lamb slain, the book of life opens before me
And I will pray for her
Some day I may return
Don't you cry for me
Beyond is where I learn

Living on a razors edge
Balancing on a ledge
Living on a razors edge... You know, You know

The evil that men do lives on and on...
The evil that men do lives on and on...
The evil that men do lives on and on...
The evil that men do lives on and on...

SOLO

Living on a razors edge
Balancing on a ledge
Living on a razors edge... You know, You know

The evil that men do lives on and on...
The evil that men do lives on and on...
The evil that men do lives on and on...
The evil that men do lives on and on...

The evil
The evil
The evil that men do
The evil
The evil
The evil that men do, Oaah, Oaah
