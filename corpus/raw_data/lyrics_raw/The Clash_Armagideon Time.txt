(W. Williams/J. Mitoo)

I stayed around don’t played around
This old town too long
Seems like I got to… travel on!

A lotta people won’t get no supper tonight
A lotta people won’t get no justice tonight
The battle is getting harder
In this iration, Armagieon time

A lotta people running and hiding tonight-ah!
A lotta people won’t get no justice tonight
Remember to kick it over
No one will guide you – Armagideon time

Oooh-oooh-ooh-ooh
Ooooh-oh-oh

Oh

This ol’ town!

Ivan and Fu-Manchu
They both are coming through, yeah
Yay

A lotta people &amp;amp;%*%*&amp;amp;*%*$&amp;amp;%*
A lotta people &amp;amp;^&amp;amp;^^&amp;amp;^*%&amp;amp;£^£*
Oh remember to kick to it over
No one will guide you, through Armagideon time
It’s Armagideon

It’s not Christmas time anymore it’s Armagideon

A lotta people

- All right, time’s up, let’s have you out of here –

Okay, okay, don’t push us when were hot!

A lotta people wont’ get not a-justice tonight
A lotta people sitting down, by the light – ah!
A lotta people a-wont get no a-supper tonight
A lotta people a-wont get no a-justice tonight
Remember, a-kick it over
No one will guide you through armagideon time
Armagideon
