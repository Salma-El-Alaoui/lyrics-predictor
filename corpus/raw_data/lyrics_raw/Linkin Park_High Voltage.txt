Just do something to tell you who I am, ya know?

Chorus x2
It's high voltage you can't shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out
It's high voltage you can't shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out

I've been digging in the crates
Ever since I was living in space
Before the rat race
Before monkeys had human traits
Mastered numerology
And bigbang theology
Performed lobotomies
With telekinetic psychology
Invented the mic
So I could start blessin it
And chincheckin kids to make my point
Like an impressionist
Many men have tried to shake us
But I'll twist my cords
Through double helixes
And show them what I'm made of
I buckle knees like leg braces
Cast the spell of instrumental-ness
And all of the emcees that hate us
So try on
Leave you without a shoulder to cry on
From now to infinity
Let icons be bygones
I fire bomb
Ghostly notes haunt this
I've tried threats
But moved on to a promise
I stomp shit
With or without an accomplice
Mix media
The stamp of approval is on this

Chorus

Akira
Put a kink in the backbones
Of clones with microphones
Never satisfy my rhyme jones
Spraying bright day
Over what you might say
Blood type krylon technicolor type A
On highways write with road rage
On pages of wind
And cages of tin
That bounce all around
Surround sound
Devouring the scene
Subliminal gangrene paintings
Overall the same things
Sing song karaoke copy madness
Break bones verbally
With sticks and stone tactics
Fourth dimension
Combat convention
Write rhymes at ease
While the tracks stand at attention
Attention
Meant to put you away
With the pencil, pistol, official
16 line rhyme missile
While you risk your all
I pick out of your flaws
Spin, rah blah blah blah
You can say you saw
