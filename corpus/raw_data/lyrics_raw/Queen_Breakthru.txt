When love breaks up
When the dawn light wakes up
A new life is born - oooooh
Somehow I have to make this final breakthru . . . now!

Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
I wake up
Feel just fine
Your face
Fills my mind
I get religion quick
'Cos you're looking divine
Honey you're touching something, you're touchin' me
I'm under your thumb, under your spell, can't you see ?
If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you
That would really be a breakthru - oh yeah

Breakthru, these barriers of pain
Breakthru, yeah, to the sunshine from the rain
Make my feelings known towards you
Turn my heart inside and out for you now
Somehow I have to make this final breakthru
Now! (now now now)
Oh yeah

Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Your smile
Speaks books to me
I break up
With each and every one of your looks at me
Honey you're starting something deep inside of me
Honey you're sparking something, this fire in me
I'm outta control, I wanna rush headlong into this ecstasy

If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you - ooh ooh ooh ooh
That would really be a breakthru
If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you
That would really be a breakthru
Oh yeah
Breakthru, breakthru

Break, hey
If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you - ooh ooh ooh ooh
That would really be a breakthru
If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you
That would really be a breakthru
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Breakthru
