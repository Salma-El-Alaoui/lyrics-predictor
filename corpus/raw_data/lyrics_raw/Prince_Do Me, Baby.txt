Here we are in this big old empty room, staring each other down
U want me just as much as I want U, let's stop fooling around
Take me baby... kiss me all over... play with my love
Bring out what's been in me for far too long
Baby, u know that's all I've been dreaming of
Do Me Baby, like u never done before
Give it to me till I just can't take no more
Do Me Baby, like u never done before
I want u now, I just can't wait no more, can't wait...

Here we are looking for a reason for u to lay me down
For a love like ours is never out of season, so baby please stop teasing me
what ya do, I can never love no other, u're the best I ever had
Whenever we're not close to one another, I just want u so bad

So Do Me Baby, like u never done before
Give it to me till I just can't take no more
C'mon, Do Me Baby, like u never done before
I want u now, I just can't wait no more

I said ooo...ooo...oooo...ooooooo
Do Me Baby, Do Me Baby, give it to me
Do Me Baby, I want u now
Do Me Baby, give it to me
Do Me Baby, Do Me baby, don't wanna do it all alone
I want your love.
Do Me Baby, give it to me
Do Me Baby, This feeling is too strong, make me wait 2 long, I want u now

You're leaving me no choice
OK, what are u gonna do...u just gonna sit there and watch? alright...
