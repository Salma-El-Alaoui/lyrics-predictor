Verse 1:
Each day I live,
I want to be a day to give the best of me.
I'm only one, but not alone,
My finest day is yet unknown.
I broke my heart, for ev'ry gain
To taste the sweet, I face the pain.
I rise and fall, yet through it all, this much remains,
I want...

Chorus:
One moment in time,
When I'm more than I thought I could be.
When all of my dreams are a heartbeat away,
And the answers are all up to me.
Give me one moment in time,
When I'm racing with destiny,
Then in that one moment of time,
I will feel, I will feel eternity.

Verse 2:
I've lived to be the very best,
I want it all, no time for less.
I've laid the plans,
Now lay the chance, here in my hands,
Give me...

Chorus x2.

Bridge:
You're a winner, for a lifetime,
If you seize that one moment in time.
Make it shine.
Give me...

Chorus x2.

I will be, I will be free.
