Here we are folks, the dream we all dream of
Boy versus girl in the World Series of love
Tell me, have u got the look?

U walked in, I woke up
I've never seen a pretty girl look so tough
Baby, u got that look

Color u peach and black
Color me taken aback
Crucial, I think I want ya

U've got the look, u've got the hook
Sho'nuff do be cookin', in my book
Ur face is jammin', ur body's heck-a-slammin'
If love is good, let's get 2 rammin'
U got the look, u got the look

Looka here
U got the look (U got the look)
U musta took (U musta took)
A whole hour just 2 make up ur face, baby

Closin' time, ugly lights,
everybody's inspected (everybody's inspected)
But u r a natural beauty unaffected (unaffected)
Did I say an hour? My face is red,
I stand corrected (I stand corrected)

U've got the look (U've got the look)
U sho'nuff do be cookin' in my book (Slammin'!)
Ur face is jammin', ur body's heck-a-slammin'
If love is good, let's get 2 rammin'
U got the look, u got the look

There's no jokin u
Well, here we are
Ladies and gentlemen,

Boy versus girl in the World Series of love
Slammin'!

U walked in (I walked in), I woke up (u woke up)

U've got the look, u've got the hook
