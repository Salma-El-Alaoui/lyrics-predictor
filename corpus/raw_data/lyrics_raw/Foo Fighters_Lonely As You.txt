What would I do, lonely as you
Pleasure or pain I can't choose
What would I do, lonely as you
Pleasure or pain I can't choose
Wake up your dreaming, I can't stand your screaming
Drowning out these prayers, just some words without meaning
Spare all the preaching, my secret's worth keeping
No one understands like I do
Keep out of reach I'm your leading deletion
Hide behind these masks though they still see right through them

(chorus)
Every now and then, you're down and out my friend
Down and out again x3
But I'm down with you
One more time for the last time
One more time for release
One more time for the last time
Everyone wants to believe)

Blame it on youth all these years I've been losing
Blame it on the past it's the last place I knew you
Blame all the children, they're raging and ruined
Blame it on the black and the blue

(chorus)x2

One more time for the last time
One more time for release
One more time for the last time
Everyone wants to believe

One more time for the last time
One more time for release
One more time for the very last time
Everyone wants to believe alright
