What on Earth am I meant to do
In this crowded place there is only you
Was gonna leave
Now I have to stay
You have taken my breath away

(ooh)
Is the world still spinning around (spinning around)
(ooh)
I don't feel like coming down

-Chorus-
It's in your eyes
I can tell what you're thinking
My heart is sinking too
It's no surprise
I've been watching you lately
I want to make it with you

Destiny has a funny way
When it comes and takes all your cares away
I can't think of a single thing
Other than what a beautiful state I'm in

(ooh)
Is the world still spinning around (spinning around)
(ooh)
I don't feel like coming down

Chorus

(ooh)
Is the world still spinning around (spinning around)
(ooh)
I don't feel like coming down

Chorus x3

It's in your eyes
