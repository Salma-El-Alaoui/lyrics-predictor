Ain't it fun when your always on the run
Ain't it fun when your friends despise what you've become
Ain't it fun when you get so high
That ya', ya' just can't come

Ain't it fun when you know that your gonna die young
It's such fun
It's such fun
It's such fun
Such fun
Such fun
Such fun
Yeah fun, such fun
Such

Ain't it fun when you take good care of your number one
Ain't it fun when you feel like you just gotta get a gun
Ain't it fun when you just can't (just can't) seem to find your tounge
'Cause your stuck in to deep and it's something that really stung
Such fun
Well come up to me and spit right in my face
I didn't even feel it
It was such a disgrace
I punched my fist right through the glass
But I didn't even feel
And it hurt me so bad
Such fun x11
Such
Aint it fun when you tell her
It was just-st a
Aint it fun when she splits
And leaves you on the run
Well ain't it fun when you broken up every band that you ever begun

Ain't it fun when you know that your gonna die young
It's such fun
It's such fun
It's such fun
Such fun
Such fun
Such fun
Yeah fun, such fun
Such
