Boy-girl, boy-girl
When a boy meets a girl
Boy-girl

Finding out
I'm finding out the things
That I've been talking about
I'm finding all the things
That I've been missing out
Finding all the things
I lose my mind
Sometimes fall behind

You and I we live on the big ship
And time goes by
You make up and I believe a lady's lie
The skinheads call it strawberries and cream
Sometimes I scream

Boy-girl, boy-girl
When a boy meets a girl
Boy-girl

We go out


A picture or a disco or a roundabout
I walk you home, I hold you there
You're giving out
I open doors so I can shut your face
Know your place

Boy-girl, boy-girl
When a boy meets a girl
Boy-girl

You can take me in your hand
Stand back, leave me, come in
Up and down and all around
You will sideways to the ground

Boy-girl, boy-girl
When a boy meets a girl
[Repeat until end]
