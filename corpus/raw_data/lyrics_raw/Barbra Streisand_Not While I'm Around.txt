Nothing's gonna harm you
Not while I'm around
Nothing's gonna harm you
No sir, not while I'm around

Demons are prowling everywhere
Nowadays
I'll send 'em howling I don't care
I've got ways

No one's gonna hurt you
No one's gonna dare
Others can desert you
Not to worry, whistle, I'll be there

Demons'll charm you with a smile
For a while
But in time
Nothing can harm you
Not while I'm around

Being close and being clever
Ain't like being true
I don't need to
I would never hide a thing from you
Like some

No one's gonna hurt you
No one's gonna dare
Others can desert you
Not to worry, whistle I'll be there

Demons'll charm you with a smile
For a while
But in time
Nothin' can harm you
Not while I'm around
