I don't know why I like it
I just do

I've been hearing your heartbeat inside of me
I keep your photograph beside my bed
Livin' in a world of fantasies
I can't get you out of my head uh
I've been waiting for the phone to ring all night
Why you wanna make me feel so good
I got a love of my own babe
I shouldn't get so hung up on you

I remember the way that we touch
I wish I didn't like it so much uh

Chorus:
I get so emotional baby
Everytime I think of you
I get so emotional baby
Ain't it shocking what love can do
Ain't it shocking what love can do
Ain't it shocking what love can do

I gotta watch you walk in the room baby
I gotta watch you walk out
I like the animal way you move
And when you talk I just watch your mouth

I remember the way that we touch
I wish I didn't like it so much no

Chorus:
I get so emotional baby
Everytime I think of you
I get so emotional baby
Ain't it shocking what love can do
I get so emotional baby
Everytime I think of you
I get so emotional baby
Ain't it shocking what love can do
Ain't it shocking what love can do
Ain't it shocking what love can do

See I remember the way that we touch
I wish I didn't like it so much no no no

Chorus:
I get so emotional baby
Everytime I think of you
I get so emotional baby
Ain't it shocking what love can do
I get so emotional baby
Everytime I think of you
I get so emotional baby
Ain't it shocking what love can do
I get so emotional oh baby
Shocking what love can do
Hey yeah baby baby baby
Baby baby
Oh Ain't it shocking what love can do
Yeah baby
Shocking what
