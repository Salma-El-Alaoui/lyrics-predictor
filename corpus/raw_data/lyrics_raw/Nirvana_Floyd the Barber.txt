Bell door on clanks, come on in
Floyd observes my hairy chin
Sit down chair don't be afraid
Steamed hot towel on my face

I was shaved
I was shaved
I was shaved

Barney ties me to the chair
I can't see I'm really scared
Floyd breathes hard I hear a zip
Pee pee pressed against my lips

I was shamed
I was shamed
I was shamed

I sense others in the room
Opey, Aunt Bea, I presume
They take turns and cut me up
I died smothered in Andy's clutch

I was shaved
I was shaved
I was shaved
