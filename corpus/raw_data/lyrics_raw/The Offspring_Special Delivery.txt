Hey now do you see me down the way
Been watching you everyday
In my car on your street is where I stay
I know you better that way
One day I'll be meeting you for real
You'll feel bad like I feel

It'll blow you away - You're gonna fall for me, You're gonna fall for me
And the voices told me
To blow you away - You're gonna fall for me, You're gonna fall for me

Hey now well I'm knocking on your door
This special delivery is yours
My infatuation it's true
Hello, got something for you

It'll blow you away - You're gonna fall for me, You're gonna fall for me
And the voices told me
To blow you away - You're gonna fall for me, You're gonna fall for me
If you hadn't sold me
I'd still be away - You're right in front of me, You're right in front of me
Then, I'll be on my way
Breathing you okay

Can't break from my sins
Cannot pray
Can't break from my sins
Cannot pray

But you can't kill a man when he's got no hope
You can't kill a man when he's got no hope
You can't kill a man when he's got no hope
You can't kill a man when he's...
GOD HELP ME!!!

It'll blow you away - You're gonna fall for me, You're gonna fall for me
And the voices told me
To blow you away - You're gonna fall for me, You're gonna fall for me
If you hadn't sold me
I'd still be away You're right in front of me, You're right in front of me
Then, I'll be on my way
When you breathe out of me
