*whistle*

I knew a man
Bojangles and he'll dance for you
In wornout shoes

With silver hair a ragged shirt
And baggy pants
He would do the old soft shoe

He would jump so high
Jump so high
Then he'd lightly
touch down

Told me of the time he worked with
with Minstrel shows
travelling throughout the south

Spoke with tears for fifteen years
How his, How his dog and he
They would travel about

But his dog up and died
got up and died
And after twenty years he still grieves

He said I dance now and
every chance in the Honky Tonks
For my drinks and tips

But most the time I
I spend behind these county bars
You see son I,
I drinks a bit

Then he shook his head
Oh Lord when he shook his head
I could swear I heard somebody say please, please

That`s Mister Bojangles
Call him Mister Bojangles
Mister Bojangles come back and dance
And dance and dance, please dance

Mister Bojangles
Mister Bojangles
ahhmm, Mister Bojangles

Come back and dance
And dance and dance, please dance
Come back and dance again Mr Bojangles
