Standing in the bog of a west end bar
guy on the right leaning over too far
money in my pocket gonna put it in the slot
open up the pack see what type I got

''[Chorus:]''
I didn't want to hold you
I didn't want to use you
protex, protex blue
all wanna do

It's a fab protective for that type of a girl
but everybody knows that she uses it well
it's the therapeutic structure I can use at will
but I don't think it fits my b.d. drill

Sitting in a carriage of a bakerloo
erotica my pocket got a packet for you
advert on the escalator on my way home
I don't need no skin flicks, I wanna be alone

''[Chorus]''

Johnny, Johnny
