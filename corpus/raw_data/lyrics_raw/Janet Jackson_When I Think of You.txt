Ooh baby

Any time my world gets crazy

All I have to do to calm it

Is just think of you



Chorus:

It's when I think of you, baby

Nothing else seems to matter

It's when I think of you, baby

All I think about, is our love



I just get more attatched to you

When you hold me in your arms

And squeeze me

And you leave me making me blue



Repeat Chorus



So in love (So in love)

Ooh (So in love)

With you (So in love)

Baby (So in love)

Ooh (So in love)

So in love

With you (So in love)



When I think of you (When I think of you)

When I think of you (When I think of you)



I'm so in love

I just think of you

When you're not around, I--

When I think of you
