I have to wonder if this wave's too big to ride
Commit or not commit in such a crazy tide
It's sooner than I thought but you called me out
I lost control and there's no doubt, I'm gonna start all over!

Out of the fire and into the fire again
You make me want to forget and start all over
Here I come straight out of my mind or worse
Another chance to get burned and start all over
I'm gonna start all over

Fantastic and romantic, all a big surprise
You've got the warning hesitation pushed aside
It's sooner than I want but you caught my heart
I guess I'm ready now to start, I'm gonna start all over!

Out of the fire and into the fire again
You make me want to forget and start all over
Here I come straight out of my mind or worse
Another chance to get burned and start all over
I'm gonna start all over

It's so easy, you disrupt me, can't complain
It's so easy, you disrupt me, can't complain
It's so easy, you disrupt me, can't complain
It's so easy, you disrupt me
I'm gonna start all over, start all over!

Out of the fire and into the fire again
You make me want to forget and start all over
Here I come straight out of my mind or worse
Another chance to get burned and start all over

Out of the fire and into the fire again
You make me want to forget and start all over
Here I come straight out of my mind or worse
Another chance to get burned and start all over
I'm gonna start all over
