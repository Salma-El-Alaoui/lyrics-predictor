You know enough to know the way
Six billion people just one name
(I found)
I found tomorrow in today
Apocalyptic and insane, my dreams will never change

You wanna be the one in control
You wanna be the one who's alive
You wanna be the one who gets old
It's not a matter of luck, it's just a matter of time

Stand out on the edge of the earth

Stand out on the edge of the earth
Dive into the center of fate
Walk right in the sight of the gun
Look into this new future's face

I know you know enough to say
I know you know enough to play the game

You wanna be the one in control
You wanna be the one who's alive
You wanna be the one who gets old
It's not a matter of luck, it's just a matter of time

Stand out on the edge of the earth
Dive into the center of fate
Walk right in the sight of the gun
Look into this new future's face

Stand out on the edge of the earth

Stand out on the edge of the earth
Stand out on the edge of the earth
(Look into the new future's face)
Stand out on the edge of the earth
(Stand out on the edge of the earth)
Dive into the center of fate
Walk right in the sight of the gun
(Walk into the sight of the gun)
Look into this new future's face
