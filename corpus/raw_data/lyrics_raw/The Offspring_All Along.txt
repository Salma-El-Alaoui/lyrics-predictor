Deep inside secrets burning
I Should have known all the while what's true
I Went along, to fool myself
Can't go on, I can't escape it

All along
I Think I really knew
It was there in the words unspoken
All along
Still believed in you
Now I leave here betrayed and broken

Close my eyes from the burning
All along, all the while it's true
Take it on, or turn your back
Either way, you can't escape it

All along
I Think I really knew
It was there in the words unspoken
All along
Still believed in you
Now I leave here betrayed and broken

ohhh ohhh oh oh oh

All along
I Think I really knew
It was there in the words unspoken
All along
Still believed in you
Now I leave here betrayed and broken
All along I still believed in you
