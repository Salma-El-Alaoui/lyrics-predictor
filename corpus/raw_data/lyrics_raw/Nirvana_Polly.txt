Polly wants a cracker
Think I should get off her first
Think she wants some water
To put out the blow torch

Isn't me
Have a seat
Let me clip
Dirty wings
Let me take a ride
Cut Yourself
Want some help
Please myself
Got some rope
Have been told
Promise you
Heaven True
Let me take a ride
Cut yourself
Want some help
Please myself

Polly wants a cracker
Maybe she would like some food
She asked me to untie her
A chase would be nice for a few

Isn't me
Have a seat
Let me clip
Dirty wings
Let me take a ride
Cut yourself
Want some help
Please myself
Got some rope
Have been told
Promise you
Have been true
Let me take a ride
Cut yourself
Want some help
Please myself

Polly said
Polly says her back hurts
She's just as bored as me
She caught me off my guard
Amazes me the will of instinct

Isn't me
Have a seat
Let me clip
Dirty wings
Let me take a ride
Cut yourself
Want some help
Please myself
Got some rope
Have been told
Promise you
Have been true
Let me take a ride
Cut yourself
Want some help
Please myself
