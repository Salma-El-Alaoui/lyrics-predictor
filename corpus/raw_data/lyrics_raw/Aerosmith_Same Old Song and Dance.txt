Get yourself a cooler lay yourself low
Coincidental murder with nothing to show
The judge constipation will go to his head
And his wife's aggravation you're soon enough dead

It's the same old story
Same old song and dance my friend... sing it
(It's the same old story)
(Same old song and dance my friend)

Yeah... gotcha with the cocaine they found wit'chor gun
No smoothy face lawyer to get'cha undone
You say love ain't the same on the south side of town
You could look but you ain't gonna find it around

Same old story
Same old song and dance my friend
It's the same old story
Same old story same old song and dance

Listen... When your fate starts knockin'
Doors start lockin'
Your old time connection
Change your direction
You ain't gonna change it
Can't rearrange it
Can't stand the pain when
It's all the same to you my friend
Yeah it's true... my friend.... wak gi gi goa
Come on come on come on come on... yeah

When you're low down and dirty from walkin' the street
Wit'chor old hurdy gurdy and no one to meet
You say love ain't the same the south side a town
You could look but you ain't gonna find it around

Same old story
Same old song and dance my friend
It's the same old story
Same old story same old song and dance... eah yeah eah yeah...
