"Second floor: hardware, children's wear, ladies' lingerie. Oh! Good morning, Mr. Tyler. Going... down?"

Yeah!

Workin' like a dog for the bossman (Whoa)
Workin' for the company (Whoa yeah)
I'm bettin' on the dice I'm tossin' (Whoa)
I'm gonna have a fantasy (Whoa yeah)
But where am I gonna look?
They tell me that love is blind
I really need a girl like an opened book
To read between the lines

Love in an elevator
Livin' it up when I'm goin' down
Love in a elevator
Lovin' it up 'til I hit the ground

Shaggin' in the elevator (Whoa)
Lingerie - second floor (Whoa yeah)
She said, "Can I see you later (Whoa)
And love you just a little more?" (Whoa yeah)
I kinda hope we get stuck
Nobody gets out of line
She said, "I'll show you how to fax in the mail room, honey
And have you home by five"

Love in an elevator
Livin' it up when I'm goin' down
Love in an elevator
Lovin' it up 'til I hit the ground

In the air, in the air
Honey one more time, now it ain't fair
Love in an elevator
Lovin' it up when I'm goin' down

Love in an...
E-le-va-tor

Going down

Love in an elevator
Lovin' it up when I'm goin' down
Love in an elevator
Livin' it up when I hit the ground

Gonna be a penthouse pauper (Whoa)
Gonna be a millionaire (Whoa yeah)
I'm gonna be a real fast talker (Whoa)
And have me a love affair (Whoa yeah)
Gotta get my timin' right (Whoa)
It's a test that I gotta pass (Whoa yeah)
I'll chase you all the way to the stairway, honey (Whoa)
And kiss your sassafras

Love in an elevator
Lovin' it up when I'm goin' down
Love in an elevator
Livin' it up 'til I hit the ground

Do you care? Do you care?
Honey one more time, now it ain't fair

Love in an elevator
Livin' it up when I'm goin' down

Do you care? Do you care?
Honey one more time, now it ain't fair

Love in an elevator
Livin' it up when I'm goin' down

In the air, in the air
Honey one more time, one more

Love in an elevator
Livin' it up when I'm goin' down

In the air, in the air
Honey one more time, one more

Love in an elevator
Livin' it up when I'm goin' down

In the air, in the air
Honey one more time, one more

Love in an elevator

Love in an elevator
Livin' it up when I'm goin' down

In the air, in the air
In the air, in the air

Love in an elevator
Lovin' it up when I'm going down
