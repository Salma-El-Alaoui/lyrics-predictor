I have a dream
a song to sing
to help me cope
with anything
if you see the wonder
of a fairy tale
you can take the future
even if you fail

I believe in angels
something good in everything I see
I believe in angels
when I know the time is right for me
I'll cross the stream
I have a dream

I have a dream
a fantasy
to help me through
reality
and my destination
makes it worth the while
pushing through the darkness
still another mile

I believe in angels
something good in everything I see
I believe in angels
when I know the time is right for me
I'll cross the stream
I have a dream

I'll cross the stream
I have a dream

I have a dream
a song to sing
to help me cope
with anything
if you see the wonder
of a fairy tale
you can take the future
even if you fail

I believe in angels
something good in everything I see
I believe in angels
when I know the time is right for me
I'll cross the stream
I have a dream

I'll cross the stream
I have a dream
