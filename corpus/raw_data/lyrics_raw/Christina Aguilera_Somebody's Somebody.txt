Wish I had somebody
Wish I was somebody's Baby
Somebody's Somebody'
Somebody's Somebody'

Watchin' lovers walkin'
Hand in hand they pass me by
Wish i was one of them
Wish i had somebody
Wakin' up beside me
Looking into my eyes at night
(I want a love to call my own)
I want a love to call my own
(I want someone that I can hold)
I want someone that I can hold
(I want someone wanting me)
I want someone wanting me
Wanna feel how it feels to be

Chorus:
Somebody's somebody
Someone's someone
Some sweet lover's lover
I wanna be the one
Someone faithful to someone faithful
Someone kind to someone kind to me
Somebody to somebody who loves me

Spending all of my time
Spending all my time on me
Where is that someone who
I can give my time to
Searching for that lover
With the love that will change my life
(I want two arms to hold me close)
I want two arms to hold me close
(I want the thing I need most)
I want the thing I need most
Somebody needing me
So I can feel how it feels to be, to be

Chorus:
Somebody's somebody
Someone's someone
Some sweet lover's lover
I wanna be the one
Someone faithful to someone faithful
Someone kind to someone kind to me
Somebody to somebody who loves me

What I'm looking for
Is someone to love me more
Than I've ever been loved before
With love so right
What I need to find
Is someone to hold me tight
What I mean is I want to be

Chorus:
Somebody's somebody
Someone's someone
Some sweet lover's lover
I wanna be the one
Someone faithful to someone faithful
Someone kind to someone kind to me
Somebody to somebody who loves me
