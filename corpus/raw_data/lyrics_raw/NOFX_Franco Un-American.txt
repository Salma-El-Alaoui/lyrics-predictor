I never thought about the universe, it made me feel small
Never thought about the problems of this planet at all
Global warming, radio-active sites
Imperialistic wrongs and animal rights! YEAH!

Why think of all the bad things when life is so good?
Why help with an ‘am’ when there’s always a ‘could’?
Let the whales worry about the poisons in the sea
Outside of California, it's foreign policy

I don’t want changes, I have no reactions
Your dilemmas are my distractions

That’s no way to go, Franco Un-American
No way to go, Franco Un-American
No way to go, Franco Un-American
No way to go, Franco, Franco Un-American

I never looked around, never second-guessed
Then I read some Howard Zinn now I’m always depressed
And now I can’t sleep from years of apathy
All because I read a little Noam Chomsky

I’m eating vegetation, ‘cause of fast food nation
I’m wearing uncomfortable shoes ‘cause of globalization
I’m watching Michael Moore expose the awful truth
I’m listening to Public Enemy and Reagan Youth

I see no world peace ‘cause of zealous armed forces
I eat no breath-mints ‘cause their from de-hoofed horses
Now I can’t believe; what an absolute failure
the president's laughing 'cause he voted for Nader


I want to move north and be a Canadian
Or hang down low with the nice Australians
I don’t want to be another ‘I-don't-care-ican’
What are we gonna do Franco, Franco Un-American
