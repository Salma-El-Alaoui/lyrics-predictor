O little town of bethlehem,
How still we see thee lie;
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by;
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting light.
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight.


The angels' voices singing
Proclaim the early morning!
And children pure and happy
A-wait the break of dawn
While charity stands watching
And faithfuls wipe the door
The dark night wakes the glory bricks
And christmas comes once more
