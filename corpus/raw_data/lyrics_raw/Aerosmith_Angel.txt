I'm alone, yeah, I don't know if I can face the night
I'm in tears and the cryin' that I do is for you
I want your love, let's break the walls between us
Don't make it tough, I'll put away my pride
Enough's enough, I've suffered and I've seen the light

Baby
You're my angel, come and save me tonight
You're my angel, come and make it all right

Don't know what I'm gonna do about this feeling inside
Yes it's true, loneliness took me for a ride
Without your love, I'm nothin' but a beggar
Without your love, a dog without a bone
What can I do, I'm sleepin' in this bed alone

Baby
You're my angel, come and save me tonight
You're my angel, come and make it all right
Come and save me tonight

You're the reason I live
You're the reason I die
You're the reason I give when I break down and cry
Don't need no reason why

Baby, baby, baby
You're my angel, come and save me tonight
You're my angel, come and make it all right

You're my angel, come and save me tonight
You're my angel, come and make it all right
Come and save me tonight
Come and save me tonight
Come and save me tonight
Come and save me tonight
Come and save me tonight
