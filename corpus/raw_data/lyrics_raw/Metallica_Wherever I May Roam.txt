... (And the road becomes my bride)
And the road becomes my bride
I have stripped of all but pride
So in her I do confide
And she keeps me satisfied
Gives me all I need

... And with dust in throat I crave
Only knowledge will I save
To the game you stay as slave

Rover, wanderer
Nomad, vagabond
Call me what you will -- yeah!

No -- but I'll take my time anywhere
Free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll redefine anywhere
Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home - yeah!

... (And the earth becomes my throne)
And the earth becomes my throne
I adapt to the unknown
Under wandering stars I've grown
By myself but not alone
I ask no one

And my ties are severed clean
Less I have the more I gain
Off the beaten path I reign

Rover wanderer
Nomad vagabond
Call me what you will -- yea will!

But I'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll never mind anywhere
Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home -- yeah-yeah!

But i'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind
And I'll take my find anywhere
Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home -- thats right!

guitar solo 2

But i'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind anywhere
And i'll redefiine anywhere
Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home
Carved upon my stone
My body lie, but still I roam -- yeah yeah!
Wherever I may roam (3x)
Wherever I may roam - yeah!
Wherever I may wander wander wander
Wherever I may roam - yeah-yeah!
Wherever I may roam - yeah-yeah!
Wherever I may roam (3x)
