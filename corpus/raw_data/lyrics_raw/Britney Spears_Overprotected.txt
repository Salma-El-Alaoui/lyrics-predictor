Spoken:
I need time, (time)
love, (love)
Joy (joy)
I need space
Love
I need me

ACTION!

Say hello to the girl that I am
You're gonna have to see through my perspective
I need to make mistakes just to learn who I am
And I don't wanna be so damn protected
There must be another way
Cause I believe in taking chances
But who am I to say
What a girl is to do
God, I need some answers

What am I to do with my life
(You will find it out don't worry)
How am I supposed to know what's right
(You just got to do it your way)
I can't help the way I feel
But my life has been so overprotected

I tell them what I like
What I won't
What I don't
But every time I do, I stand corrected
Things that I've been told
I can't believe what I hear about the world, I realize
I'm overprotected

There must be another way
'Cause I believe in taking chances
But who am I to say
What a girl is to do
God, I need some answers

What am I to do to with my life
(You will find it out don't worry)
How am I supposed to know what's right?
(You just got to do it your way)
I can't help the way I feel
But my life has been so overprotected

I need, time (love)
I need, space
(This is it)

I don't need nobody
Tellin' me just what I wanna
What I what what what I'm gonna (I need)
Do about my destiny
I say no, no
Nobody's telling me just what I wanna do, do
I'm so fed up with people telling me to be
Someone else but me

ACTION!

(Yeah...)

(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
What am I to do with my life
(You will find it out don't worry)
How am I supposed to know what's right?
(You just got to do it your way)
I can't help the way I feel
But my life has been so overprotected

I don't need nobody
Tellin' me just what I wanna
What I what what what I'm gonna
Do about my destiny
I say no, no
Nobody tell me just what I wanna do, do
I'm so fed up with people tellin' me to be
Someone else but me

What am I to do with my life
(You will find it out don't worry)
How am I supposed to know what's right?
(You just got to do it your way)
I can't help the way I feel
But my life has been so overprotected
