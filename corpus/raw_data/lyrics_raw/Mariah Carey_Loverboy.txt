I got myself a lover
Who knows what I like
When he invites me over
I come every time
And when my sugar daddy
Takes me for a ride
Whatever way we go it’s
Delirium time
He’s all mine
And his lovin’ makes me high
Like a taste of ecstasy
All I need is him to be my loverboy
Loverboy c’mon and love me
Give me more, touch me and touch me
I enjoy the way you rock me
All night long
Loverboy c’mon and take me
Only you know how to make me
Shudder with anticipation
All night long
I got myself a lover
And he’s so sublime
It’s quite a bit of heaven
To feel him inside
Cause when my sugar daddy
Takes me for a ride
Whatever way we go
It’s delirium time
I get weak
When his candy kisses sweetly
Caress my whole body
All I need is him to be
My loverboy
Chorus
