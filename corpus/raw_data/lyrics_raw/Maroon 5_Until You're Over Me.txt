[Verse 1]
This relationship is over
though my stomach still hurts.
And now I'm grown a little older
Why is the pain much worse?
You look so much better without makeup,
Why would you hide your face?
Don't want to spend the night and wake up,
Realize you've made a big mistake.

[Chorus]
I cannot refuse your eyes,
Please don't look at me tonight.
My heart beats fast I know you're there.
I pretend like I don't care
It hurts so bad to know the truth,
But I am still in love with you.

[Verse 2]
I never meant to keep you waiting,
and now your food is getting cold,
I keep denying I'm in love with you,
My routine is getting old.
And now you stand in front of the table,
And say you never look back.
Do something stupid when you're angry
You only wake up sad.

[Chorus]
I cannot refuse your eyes,
Please don't look at me tonight.
My heart beats fast I know you're there.
I pretend like I don't care
It hurts so bad to know the truth,
But girl still in love with you.
It hurts too much to know the truth,
But girl still in love with you.

No more kisses on your lips, tender touch or...
I'd rather die on my two feet than live down on my knees.
And you're the girl to get me opened up as far to bleed
And I just can't get over you, until you're over me.

[Chorus]
I cannot refuse your eyes,
Please don't look at me tonight.
My heart beats fast I know you're there,
And I pretend like I don't care.

And I can not refuse your eyes,
Please don't look at me tonight.
My heart beats fast I know you're there.
I pretend like I don't care.

It hurts too much to know the truth,
But girl I'm still in love with you.
It hurts too much to know the truth,
But girl, I'm still in love with you.
