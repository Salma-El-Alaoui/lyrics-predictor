Give me the sense to wonder,
to wonder if I'm free.
Give me the sense to wonder,
to know I can be me.
Give me the strength, to hold my head up,
spit back in their face.
Don't need no key, to unlock this door,
gonna break down the walls,
break out of this bad place.

Can I play with Madness?
The prophet stared at his crystal ball,
Can I play with Madness?
There's no vision there at all.
Can I play with Madness?
The prophet looked and he laughed at me!
Can I play with Madness?
He said you're blind, too blind to see!

I screamed aloud to the old man,
I said don't lie, don't say you don't know!
I say you'll pay for this mischief,
In this world, or the next!
Oh then he fixed me with a freezing glance,
and the hellfires raged in his eyes,
He said do you want to know the truth son?
I'll tell you the truth!
Your souls' gonna burn, in a lake of fire!
