Come join the loveboat
We're anchored offshore
Martinis and bikinis
Oh, l'amour
Loved up in lame
Quest-ce qu'on va faire
Live your love like Heaven
Sur la mer

We'll just float 'cause the beach is boring (ouhouhouhouuuu)
Our loveboat is more alluring (aahaahaaaahahaaaa)
We'll sail on with savoir fair
Sur la mer

(Paa, paa papapaa)
(Paa, paa papapaa)
(Paa, paa papapaa)
(Paa, paa papapaa)

Have a havanna
Pass me a peach
Rub on some lotion
The places I can't reach
Cool down with cocktails
Lose all your cares
007 Heaven
Sur la mer

We'll just float 'cause the beach is boring (ouhouhouhouuuu)
Our loveboat is more alluring (aahaahaaaahahaaaa)
We'll sail on with savoir fair
Sur la mer

We're in a place where Heaven breathes (oohouhouhouuuu)
Making some love and shooting the breeze (aahaahaaaahahaaaa)
Living out the memories we'll share
Sur la mer

(Come on join us on the loveboat baby)
Waltz in the wake
(Come on join us on the loveboat)
Of the shore
(Come on join us on the loveboat)
I will be there
(Come on join us on the loveboat)

(Come on join us on the loveboat baby)
Marine sunset dream
(Come on join us on the loveboat)
I'm your cure
(Come on join us on the loveboat)
I will be there
(Come on join us on the loveboat)
