Oh baby baby, Oh baby baby

Oh baby baby, how was I supposed to know
that something wasn't right here
Oh baby baby, I shouldn't have let you go
and now you're out of sight, yeah
show me how you want it to be
tell me baby cuz I need to know now
oh, because

My loneliness is killin me (and I)
I must confess I still believe (still believe)
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
give me a sign,
hit me baby one more time!

Oh baby, baby, the reason I breathe is you
Boy you've got me blinded
Oh pretty baby, there's nothin that I wouldn't do
It's not the way I planned it

Show me how you want it to be
tell me baby cuz I need to know now
oh, because

My loneliness is killin me (and I)
I must confess I still believe (still believe)
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
give me a sign,
hit me baby one more time!

Oh baby baby, how was I supposed to know
Oh pretty baby, I shouldn't have let you go

I must confess that my loneliness
is killin me now
don't you know I still believe
that you will be here
to give me a sign
hit me baby one more time

My loneliness is killin me (and I)
I must confess I still believe (still believe)
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
give me a sign,
hit me baby one more time!

I must confess (my loneliness)
that my loneliness(is killing me)
Is killing me now(I must confess)
Don't you know I still believe (still believe)
that you will be here (im losin my mind)
to give me a sign...
hit me baby one more time!
