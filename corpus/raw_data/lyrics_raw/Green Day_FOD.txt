Something's on my mind
It's been for quite some time
This time I'm on to you
So where's the other face?
The face I heard before
Your head trip's boring me

Let's nuke the bridge we torched
2,000 times before
This time we'll blast it all to hell
I've had this burning in my guts now for so long
My belly's aching now to say

Stuck down in a rut of dilogic and smut
A side of you well hid
When it's all said and done it's real and it's been fun
But was it all REAL fun

Let's nuke the bridge we torched
2,000 times before
This time we'll blast it all to hell
I've had this burning in my guts now for so long
My belly's aching now to say

to say...

You're just a fuck
I can't explain it 'cause I think you suck
I'm taking pride
in telling you to fuck off and die

I've had this burning in my guts now
for so long
My belly's aching now to say
I'm taking pleasure in the doubts
I've passed to you
So listen up as you bite this

You're just a fuck
I can't explain it 'cause I think you suck
I'm taking pride
in telling you to fuck off and die

Good night
