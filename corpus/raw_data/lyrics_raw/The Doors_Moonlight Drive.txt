Let's swim to the moon
Let's climb through the tide
Penetrate the evening that the
City sleeps to hide
Let's swim out tonight love
It's our time to try
Park besides the ocean
On our moonlight drive

Let's swim to the moon
Let's climb through the tide
Surrender to the waking world that
Laps against our side
Nothing left open and
No time to decide
We'll stop into a river
On our moonlight drive

Let's swim to the moon
Let's climb through the tide
You'll reach your hand to hold me
But I can't be your guide
It's easy to love you
As I watch you glide
Falling through wet forests
On our moonlight drive, baby
Moonlight drive

Come on baby, gonna take a little ride
Come on, down by the oceanside
Gonna get real close, get real tight
Baby, gonna drown tonight
Gonna drown, drown, drown
