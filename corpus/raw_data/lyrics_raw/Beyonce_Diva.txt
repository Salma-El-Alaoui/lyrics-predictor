Stop the track, let me state facts
I told you give me a minute, and I'll be right back
Fifty million round the world and they said that I couldn't get it
I done got so sick and filthy with benj's I cant spend
How you gone be talkin shit?
You act like I just got up in it
Been the number one diva in this game for a minute
I know you read the paper, the one that they call a queen
Every radio round the world know me
Cause that's where I be

When he pull up, wanna pop my hood up
Bet he better have a six pack, in the cooler
Getting money, divas getting money
If you aint getting money then you aint got nothing for me
Tell me somethin (tell me somthin)

Where my ladies up in there that like to talk back?

What you said (not to me)
She aint no diva (she aint no diva)
