(You kiss me, you touch me)

Don't, say ,it's like a fantasy
When, you, know this is how it should be
You kiss me, I'm falling
Can you hear me calling
You touch me, I want you
Feels like I've always known you

On a night like this
I wanna stay forever (stay forever)
On a night like this
Just wanna be together
On a night like this

Now, I'm, getting closer to you
Hold, me, I just can't be without you
You kiss me, I'm falling
It's your name I'm calling
You touch me, I want you
Feels like I've always known you

On a night like this
I wanna stay forever (stay forever)
On a night like this
Just wanna be together
On a night like this

Seems I've known you a lifetime (lifetime)
Now it's time to make you mine
On a night like this
On a night like this
Oh

You kiss me, I'm falling, you touch me
On a night like this
Just wanna be together

On a night like this
I wanna stay forever (stay forever)
On a night like this
Just wanna be together
On a night like this (ohh)

You kiss me, I'm falling, you touch me (mmm)
On a night like this
You kiss me, I'm falling, you touch me (mmm)
On a night like this
You kiss me, I'm falling, you touch me
On a night like this
