Here we are searching for a sign
Here we are searching for a sign

It's the end here today
But I will build a new beginning
Take some time, find a place
And I will start my own religion

As the day divides the night
Here we are searching for a sign

Watch the men multiply
See them ease out of the circle
Watch your friends run and hide
Help them fall back in this cycle

Here we are searching...

You saw what you get
If you take what you take
Look in the eye of the test
It's all because
Now there's a feeling I get
When I look to the left
But it should never be sensed
Our searching for a sign

Can you feel it?
Things are changing
Can you see it?
Watch as the worlds collide
Can you see it?
Can you feel it?
Watch as the worlds
Collide... into themselves
Collide... into themselves

Another time, another place
Another time, another place
Some paradigm has shunned the race
Some paradigm has shunned the race

Searching

You saw what you get

But it should never be sensed
Our searching
You saw what you get
If you take what you take
Look in the eye of the test
It's all because
Now there's a feeling I get
