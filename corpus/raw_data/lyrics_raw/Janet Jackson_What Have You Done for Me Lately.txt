&amp;quot;What's up girl?&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;He stood me up again.&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;Again?&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;Um hmmm.&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;Well what's up with this guy? Do you really like him that much?&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;Yes, honey, I love him. He is fine, he does a lot of nice things for me.&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;I know he used to do nice stuff for you, but what has he done for you lately?&amp;quot;



Used to be a time when you would pamper me

Used to brag about it all the time

Your friends seem to think that you're so peachy keen

But my friends say neglect is on your mind...

Who's right?



Chorus:

What have you done for me lately

Ooh ooh ooh yeah

What have you done for me lately

Ooh ooh ooh yeah



Used to go to dinner almost every night

Danced until I thought I'd lose my breath

Now it seems your dancin' feet are always on my couch

Good thing I cook or else we'd starve to death...

Ain't that a shame?



I never ask for more than I deserve

You know it's the truth

You seem to think you're God's gift to this earth

I'm tellin' you... no way.

You ought to be thankful for the little things

But little things are all you seem to give

You're always puttin' off what we could do today

Soap opera says you've got one life to live

Who's right who's wrong?



Repeat Chorus



This is wild... I swear.
