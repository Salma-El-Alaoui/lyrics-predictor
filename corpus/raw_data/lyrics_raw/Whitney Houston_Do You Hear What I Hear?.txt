Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy,
Do you hear what I hear
Ringing through the night, shepherd boy,
Do you hear what I hear

A song, a song, high above the trees
With a voice as big as the sea
With a voice as big as the sea

Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king
Do you know what I know
In your palace warm, mighty king
Do you know what I know
A child, a child, shivers in the cold
Let us bring him silver and gold
Let us bring him silver and gold

Said the king to the people everywhere,
Listen to what I say
Pray for peace, people everywhere,
Listen to what I say
A child, a child, sleeping in the night
He will bring us goodness and light
