I didn't know,
What I would find,
When I went lookin for a reason
I know,
I didn't read between the lines,
And baby I've got nowhere to go
I tried to take the road less traveled by
But nothin' seems to work the first few times
Am I right


So how can I ever, try to be better
Nobody ever, let's me in
And I can still see you,
This ain't the best view
On the outside lookin' in
I've been alot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside


You saw me there, but never knew
That I would give it all just to be
A part of this,
A part of you
And now it's all too late so you see
You could have helped if you had wanted to
But no one notices until it's too late to do anything


So how can I ever, try to be better
Nobody ever, let's me in
And I can still see you, this ain't the best view
On the outside lookin' in
I've been alot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside


Oh, yeah


So how could I ever, try to be better
Nobody ever, let's me in
And I can still see you, this ain't the best view
On the outside lookin' in
I've been alot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside


Oh oh
Ah, oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
