You better watch out you better not cry
You better put out records d.i.y.
Cause its not what you've done its what you've been
If you fuck up I'm telling Tim
I'm telling Tim (x3)

Take you out of book your own life part six
You wont play again at ABC
You're gonna get ostracized like Lawrence
When I tell Tim
I'm telling Tim (x3)
