It's hard to wake up
When the shades have been pulled shut
This house is haunted
It's so pathetic
It makes no sense at all
I'm ripe with things to say
The words rot and fall away
If a stupid poem could fix this home
I'd read it everyday

So here's your holiday
hope you enjoy it this time
You gave it all away
It was mine
So when you're dead and gone
Will you remember this night, twenty years
now lost
It's not right

Their anger hurts my ears
Been running strong for seven years
Rather than fix the problems, they never
solve them
It makes no sense at all
I see them everyday
We get along, so why can't they?
If this is what he wants and it's what
she wants
Then why's there so much pain?

So here's your holiday
hope you enjoy it this time
You gave it all away
It was mine
So when you're dead and gone
Will you remember this night, twenty years
now lost
It's not right

So here's your holiday
hope you enjoy it this time
You gave it all away
It was mine
So when you're dead and gone
Will you remember this night, twenty years
now lost
It's not right

It's not right
It's not right!
It's not right
