This is a sound
The here and the now
You've got to talk to talk to talk to talk
to get it all out
I listen, I listen, I listen
But you're out of tune
You're so out of tune!

(This is the last song) This is the last song
(This is the last song) that I will dedicate to you

Somethin' I found
Yeah, while I'm still around
You got to walk to walk to walk to walk
to make any ground
You'll push in, you'll push in, you'll push in
But there ain't no room,
No, there ain't no room!

This is the last song (This is the last song)
This is the last song (This is the last song)
That I will dedicate to you
Made my peace and now i'm through
(This is the last song) that I will dedicate to you

And yours is a name
I will never, name again
I will never name again
We Pretend
It doesn't matter
We pretend it all away, we pretend it all away
We pretend, we pretend, we pretend
But it ain't no use

This is the last song (This is the last song)
This is the last song (This is the last song)
That I will dedicate to you
Made my peace and now I'm through
This is the last song that I will dedicate to you
..to you, to you.
