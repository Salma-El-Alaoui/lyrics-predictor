When your brown eyes, walked away
And your brown eyes, couldn't stay
In your brown eyes, you watch her go
Then turn the record on
And wonder what went wrong (what went wrong)

If everything was everything, but everything is over
Everything could be everything, if only we were older
Guess its just a silly song about you
And how I lost you,
and your brown eyes

In your brown eyes, I was feeling low
Cause the brown eyes, and you'll never know
Got some brown eyes, but I saw her face
I knew that it was wrong, so baby
Turn the record on, play that song

Where everything was everything, but everything is over
Everything could be everything, if only we were older
Guess its just a silly song about you
And how I lost you,
and your brown eyes

Everything was everything, but baby its the last show
Everything could be everything, but its time to say goodbye
So, get your last fix and your last hit
Grab your old, go with the new trix

Its no surprise that I got lost in your brown eyes
In your brown eyes.. Brown eyes (repeat)
