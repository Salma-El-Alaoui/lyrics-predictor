We are the crowd
We’re c-comin’ out
Got my flash on, it's true
Need that picture of you
It's so magical
We'd be so fantastic-oh

Leather and jeans
Garage glamorous
Not sure what it means
But this photo of us, it don't have a price
Ready for those flashing lights
Cause you know that baby I

I'm your biggest fan
I'll follow you until you love me
Papa-Paparazzi

Baby there's no other superstar
You know that I'll be
Papa-Paparazzi

Promise I'll be kind
But I won't stop until that boy is mine
Baby you'll be famous,
Chase you down until you love me

Papa-Paparazzi

I'll be your girl
Backstage at your show
Velvet ropes and guitars
Yeah, cause you're my rock star
In between the sets,
Eyeliner and cigarettes

Shadow is burnt
Yellow dance and return
My lashes are dry
But full teardrops I cry
It don't have a price
Loving you is cherry pie

Cause you know that baby I

I'm your biggest fan
I'll follow you until you love me
Papa-Paparazzi

Baby there's no other superstar
You know that I'll be
Papa-Paparazzi

Promise I'll be kind
But I won't stop until that boy is mine
Baby you'll be famous,
Chase you down until you love me

Papa-Paparazzi


Real good
(We dance in the studio)
Snap, snapped
(That shit on the radio)
Don't stop for anyone
We're plastic, but we still have fun!

I'm your biggest fan
I'll follow you until you love me
Papa-Paparazzi

Baby there's no other superstar
You know that I'll be
Papa-Paparazzi

Promise I'll be kind
But I won't stop until that boy is mine
Baby you'll be famous,
Chase you down until you love me

Papa-Paparazzi
