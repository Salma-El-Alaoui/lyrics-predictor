Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way,
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh, hey.

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way,
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

We're dashing through the snow
In a one-horse open sleigh
All the fields we go
Laughing all the way, hey hey hey hey hey
Bells on bob-tail ring
Making spirits bright
Oh what fun it is to sing
A sleighing song tonight.

Oh Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way,
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh, hey
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way,
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

A day or two ago
I thought I'd take a ride
And soon Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side;
The horse was lean and lank
Misfortune seemed his lot,
He got into a drifting bank
And then we got upsot.
"Upsot"?

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way,
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh, hey
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way,
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

Dashing through, the fields of white
On this happy Christmas night
Off we go through the snow
Bells are ringing, we'll be singing
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle bells, Jingle bells Jing jangle
Jingle bells, Jingle bells Jing jangle
Jingle bells, Jingle bells Jing jangle
Jingle bells, Jingle bells Jing jangle
JJJJJJJingle bells, JJJJJJangle bells
JJJJ al the way

On a one-horse open sleigh
