Good times bad times, baby you're trouble
You stole my heart and you're giving me up
And we're not even friends so how can we be lovers
I wanna know the truth
'cause I've had enough
I'm sick and tired of pleasing you
Have I had your love
Is that the best you can do
You can dream of changing my mind
But you're wasting your time
'Cause if you think you've got me boy just watch me

On the dancefloor
Gonna lose it in the music
On the dancefloor
Got my body gonna use it
On the dancefloor
The best that you ever had but now you've lost me
So come on watch me getting over you

Had your chance but baby you blew it
You never loved me and baby you knew it
And every time that you messed with my mind
I still believed in you

'cause I've had enough
I'm sick and tired of pleasing you
Have I had your love
Is that the best you can do
You can dream of changing your mind
But you're way out of line
'Cause if you think you've got me
if you think you got me boy just watch me

On the dancefloor
Gonna lose it in the music
On the dancefloor
Got my body gonna use it
On the dancefloor
The best that you ever had but now you've lost me
So come on watch me getting over you
