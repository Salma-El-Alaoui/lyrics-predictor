As I was walkin' by saw you standin' there with a smile
Lookin' shy you caught my eye
Thought you'd want to hang for a while

Well I'd like to be with you and you know it's Friday too
I hope you can find the time this weekend to relax and unwind

My mind's tired I've worked so hard all week
Cashed my check I'm ready to go
I promise you I'll show you such a good time

Chorus:
Come on baby let's get away
Let's save your troubles for another day
Come go with me we've got it made
Let me take you on an escapade (let's go)

Es-ca-pade we'll have a good time
Es-ca-pade leave your worries behind
Es-ca-pade you can be mine
Es-ca-pade an escapade

So don't hold back just have a good time
We'll make the rules up as we go along
And break them all if we're not havin' fun

Repeat Chorus

My mind's tired I've worked so hard all
Worked so hard all week
I just got paid, we've got it made ready to go
I promise you I'll show you such a good time

Repeat Chorus
