"This is the moment I've waited for
I can hear my heart singing
soon bells will be ringing

This is the moment
Oh sweet aloha
I will love you longer than forever
Promise me that you will leave me never
Here I .... my dear
O my love I vow dear

Promise me that you will leave me never
I will love you longer than forever
Now than we are one
Cloud want light the sun
Blue sky is hawaii smile
on this our wedding day"

I do....
Love you.....
With all......
My................. hear
