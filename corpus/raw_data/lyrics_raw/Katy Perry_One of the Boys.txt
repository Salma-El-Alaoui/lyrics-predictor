I saw a spider, I didn't scream
'Cause I can belch the alphabet, just double dog dare me
And I chose guitar over ballet
And I take these suckers down cuz they just get in my way

The way you look at me is kinda like a little sister
You high-five your goodbyes and it leaves me nothing but blisters

So I don't want to be one of the boys, one of your guys
Just give me a chance to prove to you tonight
I just wanna be one of the girls, pretty in pearls
Not one of the boys

So over summer something changed
I started reading 17 and shaving my legs
And I study Lolita religously
And I walked right in school and caught you staring at me

'Cause I know what you know but now you're gonna have to take a number
It's okay, maybe one day but not until you give me my diamond ring

'Cause I don't want to be one of the boys, one of your guys
Just give me a chance to prove to you tonight
That I just wanna be a homecoming queen, be a poster dream
Not one of the boys

I wanna be a flower not a dirty weed
And I wanna smell like roses not a baseball team
And I swear maybe one day you're gonnna wanna
Make out make out make out with me

So I don't want to be one of the boys, one of your guys
Just give me a chance to prove to you tonight
I just wanna be one of the girls, pretty in pearls
Not one of the boys
