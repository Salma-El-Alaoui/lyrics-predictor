You make me dizzy
Running circles in my head
One of these days Ill chase you down
Well look whos going crazy now
Were face to face my friend
Better get out
Better get out

You know you make me breakout
Make me breakout

I dont wanna look like that
I dont wanna look like that
Know you make me breakout

You can see this on my face
Its all for you
The more and more I take I break right through
Therapy still scares me
Putting me on my back again
I may be crazy, little frayed around the ends
One of these days Ill phase you out

Burn it in the blast off
Burn it in the blast off
Watch me crawl away
Try to get out
Try to get out

You know you make me breakout
Make me breakout

Breakout!
Go, go, go
