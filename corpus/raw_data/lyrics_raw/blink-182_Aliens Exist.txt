Hey mom there's something in the backroom
I hope it's not the creatures from above
You used to read me stories
As if my dreams were boring
We all know conspiracies are dumb

What if people knew that these were real (these were real)
I'd leave my closet door open all night
I know the CIA would say
What you hear is all hearsay
I wish someone would tell me what was right


Up all night long
And there's something very wrong
And I know it must be late
Been gone since yesterday
I'm not like you guys
I'm not like you

I am still the skeptic yes you know me (yes you know me)
Been best friends and will be till we die (till we die)
I got an injection
A fear from the abuction
My best friend thinks Im just tellin lies

Alright...

Up all night long
And there's something very wrong
And I know it must be late
Been gone since yesterday
I'm not like you guys
I'm not like you

Dark and scary, ordinary, explanation
Information, nice to know ya, paranoia
Where's my mother, biofather...

Up all night long
And there's something very wrong
And I know it must be late
Been gone since yesterday
I'm not like you guys...
twelve majestic lies
