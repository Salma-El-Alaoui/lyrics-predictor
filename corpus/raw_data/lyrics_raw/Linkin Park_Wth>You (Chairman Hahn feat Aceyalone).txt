Come on!

I woke up in a dream today
To the cold of the static
And put my cold feet on the floor
Forgot all about yesterday
Remembering I'm pretending to be where I'm not anymore
A little taste of hypocrisy
And I'm left in the wake of the mistake
Slow to react
Even though you're so close to me
You're still so distant, and I can't bring you back

It's true, the way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories
Even if you're not with me
I'm with you
(You, now I see, keeping everything inside)
With you
(You, now I see, even when I close my eyes)
With you
(You, now I see, keeping everything inside)
With you
(You, now I see, even when I close my eyes)
With you
Ughhhh!

I hit you and you hit me back
And we fall to the floor
The rest of the day stands still
Fine line between this and that
But when things go wrong, I pretend the past isn't real
Now I'm trapped in this memory
And I'm left in the wake of the mistake
Slow to react
Even though you're close to me
You're still so distant, and I can't bring you back

It's true, the way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories
Even if you're not with me
I'm with you
(You, now I see, keeping everything inside)
With you
(You, now I see, even when I close my eyes)
With you
(You, now I see, keeping everything inside)
With you
(You, now I see, even when I close my eyes)
Ughhhh!

(No)
I won't let you control my fate while i'm holding the weight of
the world on my concience
(No)
I won't just sit here and wait while you weighin your options
You're makin a fool of me
(No)
You didnt dare to try and say you dont care
And solemnly swear not to follow me there
(No)
It aint like me to beg on my knees
Or, please oh baby please
Thats not how i'm doin things
(No)
No i'm not upset, no i'm not angry
I know love is love and love sometimes, it pains me
(No)
With or without you, I'll always be with you
You'll never forget me, i'm keeping you with me
(No)
I won't let you take me to the end of my rope
While you burn it and torture my soul
(No)
No I'm not your puppet
And no, no, no, I won't let you go

No, no matter how far we've come
I can't wait to see tomorrow
No matter how far we've come
I, I can't wait to see tomorrow

With you
(You, now I see, keeping everything inside)
With you
(You, now I see, even when I close my eyes)
With you
(You, now I see, keeping everything inside)
With you
(You, now I see, even when I close my eyes)
Ughhhhh!
