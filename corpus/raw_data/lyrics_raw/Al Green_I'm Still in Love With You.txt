spending my day thinking bout you girl
being here with you, being near with you, I can't explain myself
why I feel like I do (like I do)
though it hurt me so, to let you know when I look in your eyes
and if you let me know how you feel
let me know if this love is really real, but it seems to me
that i'm wrapped up in your love
don't you know that i'm still in love, sho-nuff in love with you, hey
heaven knows that i'm still in love with you, sho-nuff in love with you hey
hey hey, when I look in your eyes, aw for all the years i see (i see)
me loving you, and you loving me, hey seem to me
that i'm still wrapped up in your love
don't you know that i'm still in love, sho-nuff in love with you, hey i'm, i'm
