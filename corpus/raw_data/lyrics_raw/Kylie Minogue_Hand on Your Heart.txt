Put your hand on your heart and tell me
That we're through, ooh
Oh, put your hand on your heart
Hand on your heart

Well it's one thing to fall in love
But another to make it last
I thought that we were just begining
And now you say we're in the past
Oh, look me in the eye
And tell me we are really through

You know it's one thing to say you love me
But another to mean it from the heart
And if you don't intend to see it through
Why did we ever start
Oh, I wanna hear you tell me
You don't want my love

CHORUS:
Put your hand on your heart and tell me
It's all over
I won't believe it till you
Put your hand on your heart and tell me
That we're through, ooh

Oh, put your hand on your heart
Hand on your heart

They like to talk about forever
But most people never get the chance
Do you wanna lose our love together
Do you find a new romance
Oh, I wanna hear you tell me
You don't want my love

CHORUS: (x 2)

Oh, put your hand on your heart
Hand on your heart

(Hand on your heart)
Hand on your heart
(Hand on your heart)
Hand on your heart

Oh, look me in the eye
And tell me we are really through

CHORUS:
repeat & fade
