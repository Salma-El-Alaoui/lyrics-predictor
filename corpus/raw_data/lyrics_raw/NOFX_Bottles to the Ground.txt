You know it when it's over
Doors are closing feel the
Sober staring at you
You better take
One last good look
One more round and
It's bottles to the
Ground smashing
Of the glass what a supersonic sound
You gotta pull the
Plug when it's time
To die bottles to
The ground
Theres a suitcase
On the sidewalk
There's a record in
A milkcrate, she'll be
Staying you'll be
Trowing wiskey
Over one lip
One more round
Then it's bottle
To the ground
Smasing of the
Glass a perfect
Imperfect sound
You gotta pay the
Piper when the rats
Are gone whoa whoa
All bottles
To the ground
