I never found out why you left him
but this answer begs that question.
Too blind to see tomorrow, too broke
to beg or borrow.
Young and Stupid
Left wide open, hearts are wasted
lives are broken.

One more point of contention,
I need some intervention
Approached with vague intentions
Betray my short attention-span
the distance bridge the border, beg forgiveness, round the corner.

Everytime I look for you - the sun goes down.

And I stumble when this whole thing runs aground.
I left another message
you are never around.
but everytime I look for you - the sun goes down.
Once more.
Will the last one out, please shut the door.

More time apart will give you
a few more months to argue.
Is this to much to live through
It always seemed too far to drive
the point home, (send more letters), pray tomorrow - (ends up better).

Everytime I look for you - the sun goes down.

And I stumble when this whole thing runs aground.
I left another message
you are never around.
but everytime I look for you - the sun goes down.
Once more.
Will the last one out, please shut the door.

I never did do anything that she asked,
I never let what happend, stay in the past
I never did quite understand what she meant.
In spite of everything, in spite of everything..

Everytime I look for you - the sun goes down.

And I stumble when this whole thing runs aground.
I left another message
you are never around.
but everytime I look for you - the sun goes down.
