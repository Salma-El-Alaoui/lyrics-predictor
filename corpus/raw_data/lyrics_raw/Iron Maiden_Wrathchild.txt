born into a scene
of angriness and greed
of dominance and persecution

My mother was a queen
my dad I've never seen
I was never meant to be.

Now I spend my time
looking all around
For a man that's nowhere
to be found,
Until I find him,
I'm never gonna stop searching
I'm going to find my man
gonna travel round.

so long wrathchild
Yeah I'm a wrathchild,
hello wrathchild
comin' to get you
oooh yeaheyeah

Some say it shouldn't matter
ain't nothing gonna alter
the course of my destination

But I know I've gotta find
some seriaus peace of mind
or I know I'll just go crazy

Now I spend my time
looking all around
For a man that's nowhere
to be found,
Until I find him,
I'm never gonna stop searching
I'm going to find my man
gonna travel round.

so long wrathchild
well I'm a wrathchild
yeah wrathchild
comin' to get you
oooh yeaheyeah
