Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide,
No escape from reality.
Open your eyes,
Look up to the skies and see.
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low,
Any way the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me,
To me

Mama, just killed a man,
Put a gun against his head,
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun,
But now I’ve gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh,
Didn’t mean to make you cry.
If I’m not back again this time tomorrow,
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters.

Too late, my time has come,
Sends shivers down my spine
Body’s aching all the time,
Goodbye everybody, I’ve got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh, (any way the wind blows)
I don’t want to die,
I sometimes wish I’d never been born at all

I see a little silhouetto of a man,
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very very frightening me
Galileo - Galileo
Galileo - Galileo
Galileo - Figaro
Magnifico - ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!

I’m just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He’s just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity

Easy come, easy go,
Will you let me go?

Bismillah! No! We will not let you go! - Let him go!
Bismillah! We will not let you go! - Let him go!
Bismillah! We will not let you go! - Let me go!
Will not let you go! - Let me go!
Will not let you go! - Let me go, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Mama Mia, Mama Mia, Mama Mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Ooh baby, can’t do this to me baby
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right out of here

Ooh yeah
Ooh yeah

Nothing really matters,
Anyone can see,
Nothing really matters,
Nothing really matters to me

Any way the wind blows
