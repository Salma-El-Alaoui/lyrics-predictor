My daddy was the family bass man,
My mamma was an engineer,
And i was born one dark grey morn with music coming in my ears, in my ears,

They call me baby driver,
And once upon a pair of wheels i hit the road and i'm gone,
Watch my number, i wonder how your engines feel
Ba ba ba baa,
Scoot down the road,
Watch my number, i wonder how your engines feel

Shine a light
Ouuuu ouuuuu ouuuuu oueee ooooe.......

My daddy was a prominant frog man,
My mamma's in the naval reserve,
When i was young i carried a gun but i never got the chance to serve,
I did not serve,

They called me baby driver,
and once upon a pair of wheels,
I hit the road and i'm gone,
watch my number, i wonder how your engines feel,
Ba ba ba baa
Scoot down the road,
Watch my number, i wonder how your engines feel

Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh...ba ba ba baa,

My daddy got a big promotion,
My mamma got a raise in pay,
There's no one home, we're all alone, oh come to my room and play,
Yes we can play,
I'm not talking about your pigtails,
But i'm talking 'bout your sex appeal,
I hit the road and i'm gone,
Watch my number, i wonder how your engine feels,
Ba ba ba baa
Scoot down the road, watch my number, i wonder how your engines feel.
