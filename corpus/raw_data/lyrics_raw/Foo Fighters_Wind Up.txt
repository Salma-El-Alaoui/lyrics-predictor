I have a choice between the bat and the belt
Each time I hear about the hand you've been dealt
Spare me confession, it's confession you sell
Maybe I'll fall behind but I don't mind because I'll catch up

I want a song thats indelible like manimal
I hope you never see me wind up

Will I be happy on the back of the shelf
Will you be happy when we're sharing a cell
Spare me your questions since you know me so well
Someday you'll realize that I get shy and I choke up

I want a song thats indelible like manimal
I hope you never see me wind up
What is wrong with this animal, I'm terrible
I hope you never see me wind up

Farewell my sweet paramania
(REPEAT)

My only promise is that I'll never tell
Keep you at a distance from the things that I felt
I'll bite the bullet, take the beating until
I take it all back anyway, what was I supposed to say?

I want a song thats indelible like manimal
I hope you never see me wind up
What is wrong with this animal, I'm terrible
I hope you never see me wind up
