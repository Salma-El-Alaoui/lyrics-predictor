Well, I got into town about an hour ago.
Took a look around see which way the wind blow,
With a little girl in a Hollywood bungalow.
Are you a lucky little lady in the City of Light
Or just another lost angel

City at night.
City at night.
City at night.
City at night.

L.A. Woman, L.A Woman
L.A. Woman, Sunday afternoon
L.A Woman, Sunday afternoon

L.A Woman, Sunday afternoon
Drive thru your suburbs
Into your blues
Into your blues
Into your blue, blue, blues
Into your blues

I see your hair is burnin'
Hills are filled with fire
If they say I never loved you
You know they are a liar

Drivin' down your freeway
Midnight alleys roam
Cops in cars, the topless bars
Never saw a woman
So alone,
So alone, so alone, so alone

Motel Money Murder Madness
Let's change the mood
From glad to sadness

Mr. Mojo Risin'
Mr. Mojo Risin'
Mr. Mojo Risin'
Mr. Mojo Risin'
Got to keep on risin'
Mr. Mojo Risin'
Mr. Mojo Risin'
Mr. Mojo Risin'
Mr. Mojo Risin'
Got my mojo risin'
Mr. Mojo Risin'
Got to keep on risin'
Goin' ridin', ridin'
Goin' ridin', ridin'
Got to ridin', ridin'
Ridin', ridin'

Well, I got into town about an hour ago.
Took a look around see which way the wind blow,
With a little girl in a Hollywood bungalow.

Or just another lost angel

City at night.
City at night.
City at night.
City at night.

L.A. Woman, L.A Woman
L.A Woman
You're my woman

A little L.A woman
L.A Woman
Hey, hey, come on
L.A woman come on
