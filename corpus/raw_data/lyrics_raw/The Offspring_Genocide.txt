Our lives run different ways
Through the rain I see you in the sun
Our star shines anyway
If you wish upon it we are one

1,2,3,4

[chorus:]
Dog eat dog
Every day
On our fellow man we prey
Dog eat dog
To get by
Hope you like my genocide

I find it such a shame
Through the pain I see things as they are
We're served up on a plate
The pedestal is high enough to fall
And if in time
We can see the errors of our ways
Would anyone change it anyhow?
Our time is up......

1,2,3,4
[chorus x2]

I bet you'd only run,
If you saw what goes inside our own,
I bet you'd lead the way,
If it were up to you to decide,
But it's not

[chorus x2]

Like a silver flame,
Like a suicide,
Like killing boy,
1,2,3,4!
