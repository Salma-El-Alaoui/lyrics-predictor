Shattered, shattered
Love and hope and sex and dreams are still surviving on the streets
And look at me, I'm in tatters
I'm shattered
Shattered

Friends are so alarming, my lover's never charming
Life's just a cocktail party on the street, Big Apple
People dressed in plastic bags (Shadoobie, shattered)
Directing traffic, some kind of fashion
Shattered

Laughter, joy, and loneliness and sex and sex and sex and sex
And look at me, I'm in tatters
I'm shattered
Shattered

All this chitter-chatter, chitter-chatter, chitter-chatter 'bout
Shmatta, shmatta, shmatta, I can't give it away on 7th Avenue (Shadoobie, shattered)
This town's been wearing tatters, uh-huh
Shadoobie, shattered

Work and work for love and sex
And ain't you hungry for success, success, success, success
Does it matter?
Shattered, does it matter?
Shattered

Ahh look at me, I'm shattered
I'm shattered
Look at me, I'm shattered
Shattered

Pride and joy and greed and sex, that's what makes our town the best
Pride and joy and dirty dreams and still surviving on the street (Tatters)
And look at me, I'm in tatters
I've been battered (Shattered)
What does it matter? (Shattered)
Does it matter? (Shattered)
Uh-huh, does it matter?
Uh-huh, I'm shattered
Mmm, shattered

Shadoobie, shattered
Shadoobie, shattered
Shadoobie, shattered, shattered

Don't you know the crime rate's going up, up, up, up, up (Shadoobie, shattered)
To live in this town, you must be tough, tough, tough, tough, tough (Shadoobie, shattered, shadoobie, shattered, shattered)
You got rats on the west side, bed bugs uptown (Shadoobie, shattered)
What a mess, this town's in tatters, I've been shattered (Shadoobie, shattered)
My brain's been battered, splattered all over Manhattan (Shadoobie, shattered)
Shadoobie, shattered, shattered
Shadoobie, shattered
Shadoobie, shattered
Shadoobie, shattered

Uh-huh, this town's full of money grabbers (Shadoobie, shattered, shattered)
Go ahead, bite the Big Apple, don't mind the maggots, uh-huh (Shadoobie, shattered, shadoobie, shattered)
Shadoobie, my brain's been battered (Shadoobie, shattered, shattered)
My friends they come around they (Shadoobie, shattered)
Flatter, flatter, flatter, flatter, flatter, flatter, flatter (Shadoobie, shattered)
Pile it up, pile it up, pile it high on the platter (Shadoobie, shattered, shattered)
