Fortune, fame; mirror vain; gone insane;
But the memory remains

Heavy rings on fingers wave
Another star denies the grave
See the nowhere crowd cry the nowhere tears of honor
Like twisted vines that grow
That hide and swallow mansions whole
And dim the light of an already faded prima donna

Fortune, fame; mirror vain; gone insane;
Fortune, fame; mirror vain; gone insane;
But the memory remains

Heavy rings hold cigarettes
Up to lips that time forgets
While the Hollywood sun sets behind your back
And can't the band play on?
Just listen, they play my song
Ash to ash, dust to dust, fade to black

Fortune, fame; mirror vain; gone insane;
Fortune, fame; mirror vain; gone insane;
Dance little tin goddess

(na-na-na-na....)

Drift away, fade away, little tin goddess
Ash to ash, dust to dust, fade to black

Fortune, fame; mirror vain; gone insane;
Fortune, fame; mirror vain; gone insane;
But the memory remains

Ash to ash, dust to dust, fade to black
But the memory remains

Yeah
Faded prima donna, yeah, yeah

Dance little tin goddess, dance

(na-na-na-na...)
