A little sweat aint never hurt nobody
While ya'll standin on the wall

Chorus:
Gettin bodied (gettin bodied)
Gettin bodied (gettin bodied)

Bridge:
Baby all I want
Is to let it go
Aint no worries no
We can dance all night
Get me bodied
That means come closer to me
While we grind to the beat
And your body touchin me

All I need
Is to let it be
Aint no worries no
Boy dance with me
Feel my body
Dont stop just come closer to me
While we grind to the beat
And your body touchin my body

All I'm with tonight is gettin bodied
Aint no shame cuz I gotta get mine
I swing my hair and kick off my shoes
Come here boy, let me work on you

(Hook)
(Chorus)
