Sleeping very soundly on a Saturday morning
I was dreaming I was Al Capone
there's Rumor going 'round, gotta clear outta town
i'm Smelling like a dry fish bone
Here comes the Law, gonna break down the door,
gonna Carry me away once more
Never, never, never want it any more
Gotta get away from this stone cold floor

Crazy
Stone cold crazy, you know

Rainy afternoon, i got a blow a typhoon,
Playing on my slide trombone
Anymore, anymore, cannot take it anymore
Gotta get away from this stone cold floor

Crazy
Stone cold crazy, you know

Walking down the street,
Shooting people that I meet,
Fully loaded tommy gun,
Here comes the deputy, try fuckin' gettin' me
Gotta fuckin' get up and run
They got the sirens loose
I run right outta juice
They're gonna put me in a cell, if I can't go to heaven
will they Let me go to hell?

Crazy
Stone cold crazy, you know
