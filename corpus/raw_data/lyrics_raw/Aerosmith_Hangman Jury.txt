Me and my old lady sittin' in the shade
Talkin' about the money that I ain't made
Singin' whoa boy, dontcha lie on the track-a-lack-a
Whoa boy, dontcha lie on the track
Whoa boy, dontcha lie on the track-a-lack-a
Whoa boy, dontcha lie on the track

And if I could, I surely would
Stand on the rock that Moses stood
Singin' whoa boy dontcha lie on the track-a-lack-a
Whoa boy, dontcha lie on the track
Whoa boy, dontcha lie on the track-a-lack-a
Whoa boy, dontcha lie on the track

Drank so much hooch it made my eyes be gettin' blurry
They say I nailed her to the wall
A stitch in time don't mean a thing
No hangman jury could make me crawl
'Cause I'm a poor boy, dontcha lie on the track-a-lack-a
Whoa boy, dontcha lie on the track-a-lack-a
Whoa boy, dontcha lie on the track

Whatcha do with a gun that's loaded
Shot her dead and her heart exploded
Tell me baby now d-dontcha worry
Like lying to the hangman jury

I swear I didn't know that .45 was loaded
In fact my memory ain't too clear
That's not to say she didn't get what she deserved
'Least that's the way it looked from here boy, when you lie on the track-a-lack-a
Here boy, when you lie on the track-a-lack-a
Here boy, when you lie on the track

Ohh, her love came tumblin' down, yeah
Ohh, when love come tumblin' down
Ohh, (Let's get outta here) When love come tumblin'

And every night she'd take her thing into the city
And in the mornin' make me beg
'Cause if I'd taken all her real nitty gritty
I'd smack her right upside the head boy, dontcha lie on the track-a-lack-a
Hey boy, dontcha lie on the track
Hey boy, dontcha lie on the track

Ohh, when love come tumblin' down
Ohh, when love come tumblin' down
Ohh, when love come tumblin'

Poor boy sweatin' in the hot summer night
Hangman waitin' for the early morning light
Singin' hey boy, dontcha lie on the track-a-lack-a
Hey boy, dontcha lie on the track
Hey boy, dontcha lie on the track-a-lack-a
Hey boy, dontcha lie on the track

And if I could, I surely would
Stand on the rock that Moses done stood
Singin' hey boy, dontcha lie on the track-a-lack-a
Hey boy, dontcha lie on the track
Hey boy, dontcha lie on the track-a-lack-a
Hey boy, dontcha lie on the track
