You, you know how to get me so low
My heart had a crash when we spoke
I can't fix what you broke

You, you always have a reason
Again and again this feelin'
Why do I give in

And I always was
Always was one for crying
I always was one for tears

The sun's getting cold, it's snowing
Looks like an early winter for us
Looks like an early winter for us
An early winter
Oh, I need you to turn me over

It's sad the map of the world is on you
The moon gravitates around you
The seasons escape you

And I always was
Always was one for crying
I always was one for tears

No, I never was
Never was one for lying
You lied to me all these years

The sun's getting cold, it's snowing
Looks like an early winter for us
Looks like an early winter for us
An early winter
Oh, I need you to turn me over

Why? Why do you act so stupid
Why? You know that I'm always right

It looks like an early winter for us
It hurts and I can't remember sunlight
An early winter for us
The leaves are changing color for us

And it gets too much, yeah, it gets so much
Starting over and over and over again
And it gets too much, yeah, it gets so much
Starting over and over and over again
And it gets too much, yeah, it gets so much
Starting over and over and over again
