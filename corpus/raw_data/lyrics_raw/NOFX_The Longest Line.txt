In the darkest tunnel it's nice to see a light

Not just a headlight

Like the one that's heading right for me

It would be nice if things could turn out right

Turn out right yeah

Don't think I'll ever see the day



I must have done something wrong

Or maybe pissed off god



I think of Chinese food when I think of life

That's sweet and sour

My life is sweet as saccharine

You know 3 week old milk and grapes are not

Not the same, No

I am the one Johnny Carcinogen



I must have fucked with some witch

In turn she cursed me, cursed my life



At the end of the longest line

That's where I will always be

If you need to find me, just go to

The end of the longest line



But officer that was a yellow light

The light was red, son

Insubordination, reckless driving

I must be wrong, this can't be right

I don't belong, this world is much to dangerous

For someone lacking luck, like me



At the end of the longest line

That's where I will always be

If you need to find me, just go to

The end of the longest line



At the end of the longest line

That's where I will always be

At the end of the longest line
